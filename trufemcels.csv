1,Respecting the ones who make me have a boner because they are the only ones that matter.
2,"Lol there was this one boy who was super cold, sexist, and rude to me when I was unattractive but has recently dmed me about how he's become a better person. I check his Twitter and I see him being cruel to any woman he is not attracted to."
3,"The reverse is also true: Respecting women only because you're not ""tempted"" or ""threatened"" by them is also not respecting women."

8,"Hey I just want to say thanks. Even though you are not a femcel, you are respectful towards everyone in this sub and don't leave unnecessary comments if you can't relate. I've had stacy-lite woman come here give her  all high mighty opinion in a passive aggressive way,after she saw that her trying to force her opinion on us wasn't working she called me a ''ugly pathetic bitch''"
9,"i hate moids like that. you know they're going to do a whole 180 as soon as you seem ""less attractive"""
10,He can go fuck himself then.
11,Wish I could upvote this twice. (And also upvote the original post twice.)
12,What is your definition of respect?
13,Too bad no one saw your comment and now you're banned.
14,Are you aware that not one comment of yours has been published on this sub and that you just got banned bc this is a sub for women only?  Keep your unsolicited opinions in your jock strap.
15,Lol I‚Äôll do a sneaky edit.
16,I'm sorry you had to deal with that. People who come here should understand that this is a place for femcels and put femcels first and respect they're wishes.
17,"''ugly pathetic bitch''

This is a word they like to use when loosing an argument because they have no substantial points at all. Using the ""word"" ugly as an offense to someone speaks numbers about that person. The number of brain cells they need because they are clearly that stupid"
18,Honestly the thing that reassures me is that he will be fucking himself because this guy is obsessed with Latina girls but he's also a Trump supporter so they don't want him. Then he whines about liberals being intolerant and how it's shallow and discrimination to not want to date Trump supporters. JFL how can somebody be this clueless and stupid.
19,"Because social hierarchy being an ugly woman is like being a short man

You can't just point at a man and say he's poor and or has weak wrists. That's just more of a way to break into laughter for all sides. Same way you can't really tell a woman her pussy smells though that's also something beyond her control.

So ugly is the only leverage they have to remind you your standing."
20,The irony...
21,You need a flair so brilliant comments like this one don't get filtered. Please select one
22,"I just want to give some more info, so don't mind me lol

Here's a video of the girl (Yang Peiyi) who was actually singing one year later: https://youtu.be/Lc4CCw9l8ok

Brief translation: Peiyi was finally on stage one year after the Olympics and she made her first record. Contrary to expectations, she didn't want the record to sell well because she didn't want to become a star. She also wished Ling Miaoke (lip synching girl) well and they're actually friends. Even though she likes Miaoke, she didn't like the director. She said he looked to strict and ugly lol. He wouldn't talk to her and he would just pat her head and mess up her hair. After the Olympics, Miaoke was starred in various commercials, movies, and dramas. Finally after one year, Peiyi came out with an album and became a star in her own right.

Btw I actually think Peiyi is super cute and props to her for being such a strong little girl."
23,"Jesus Christ, imagine caring what a young CHILD looks like?"
24,A fucking little girl. That's how early lookism starts for women. -.-
25,"Sadly girls from the moment they are born are judged on how ''pretty"" and good-looking they are."
26,"Imagine going through life knowing your country‚Äôs Olympics thought you were too ugly to represent them. I hope she has good people around her. This is, very sad."
27,"When I saw this photo, I was confused because both girls are equally cute; then, I read an article someone posted and it said the original girl had crooked teeth (like all kids do), and that wasn‚Äôt a good ‚Äúimage‚Äù for China so they needed another little girl. How fucking shallow.... kids are supposed to have jenky teeth."
28,"It's ironic how I find this post while reading ""Beauty Pays"" by David Hammermesh and I saw this incidence in the book. This is what they always do, replace unattractive people and have attractive people lip syncing"

30,"I remember being bullied for my looks and glasses as early as kindergarten or first grade, so much so that I chased one bully around with scissors and was expelled for it."

32,"This is real https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.china1
So please do some research before you call something bait."
33,Hey no problem at all! :)
34,"That's exactly what it is, at least in western media.

* Movies aimed at men: ordinary guy gets hot girl

* Movies aimed at women: hot girl learns that hot guys are douchebags and starts dating uglier guy

That's always the plot."
35,So true
36,Tryna look pretty for a nerd who is only nice 1% of the time rn.
37,i still want to be prettier by starving myself and working out a bunch & learning to do feminine normie stacy becky make up so i can be lovable to some simp cuck dorky guy even tho on the inside i secretly want to be a boy...
38,Women will always be attacked on the basis of their physical appearance and thassa fact- if you‚Äôre hot you‚Äôre a dumb whore who is ‚Äútoo pretty for STEM‚Äù if you‚Äôre ugly you will be shamed for it even if your career has literally nothing to do with looks

42,Sadly life imitates art
43,"Propaganda means writers put those stories to the screen and it affects the way society feels - men grow up entitled, women grow up with low standards."
44,"Even if it's 'only' movies as you say, why the double standard on those situations? Don't tell me you don't believe that's not propaganda... Of course it ain't real life! But they are trying to change reality to their convenience."
45,Movies are a cultural and social influence
46,"Usually movies are relatable to the specific region so people will watch them. Even though movies are made all over the world, most movies that are shown and promoted in the western world are western... and even then.. its region specific. Unless the movie is amazing, it usually stays within it's own community. That being said, the reason the writers wrote the script that way is because its RELATABLE. This is the truth. So many damn movies and kid shows where the nerd girl gets an extreme makeover to get the hot guy while the nerd typically just has to put himself in a position to get noticed. There may be a slight makeover but very rarely is it ever the same extent that women go through."
47,"Omg literally me every time, its like I can hear the hallelujah /wedding bells from afar!! :D"
48,"Dude is nice to me because of courtesy or because I paid some money to him, and my heart just starts beating on its own

53,"Don't worry, you'll be old and treated like shit by those very same males sooner than you think."
54,[deleted]
55,"I just wish a male would like me and be nice to me just once... So I could spit in his fucking face. I have been spat on by a male before and males always spit on the street when they catch my eye - it's an Estonian male thing, to show a woman she is undesired - so it would be so fucking great to get to be the one doing it."
56,[deleted]
57,"Thanks. I doubt I'll get anything I want here in eastern aka shithole europe but hopefully I can find a way to get out of here by some miracle. The hard thing is to try and figure out all the ways males can take credit for my work or just plain not pay me. Males either want to screw you or screw you over and despite what most women think, the last option is way harder to live with. Congrats on ascending, don't fall back down, it fucking sucks here."
58,The proof is in the [pudding](https://www.bustle.com/articles/27995-my-tinder-dating-experiment-how-men-reacted-to-3-different-levels-of-makeup). Men have varying levels of respect for you based on your make-up.
59,When men say they prefer natural beauty... what they really mean is makeup without dramatic eyes and blush
60,People have been using pigment to change their appearance since the time of the Egyptians. No one is going to stop doing this. I experience radically different treatment when I wear makeup than when I don't. Usually I wear minimal/natural makeup because I feel like I look foolish in more dramatic makeup looks.
61,Men don't care to differentiate between real or fake. They'd much rather have fake interest from a woman they pay and fake beauty with loads of foundation and eye makeup.
62,That's a damn shame... SMH!
63,I just want my face to not look like the back of a chocolate chip cookie lmao
64,Sorry but I had to laugh at this.  ü§≠
65,There is no such thing as natural beauty.

68,"Though she got just as many matches with no makeup as she did with ""natural"" makeup, and actually got less matches with heavy makeup. And the guys were the most respectful and sent the least sexually harassing messages when she had no makeup...so wouldn't this indicate no makeup at all is the optimal strategy?"
69,Damn
70,[deleted]
71,But makeup isn‚Äôt natural. Men are socially conditioned to think that faces full of makeup are actually normal for women. They see women in tv and online fully made up and start to expect that as a base standard for women. Which causes them to change their standards and believe women with makeup are ‚Äúnatural‚Äù. Or did you mean something different with this comment?
72,[deleted]
73,Thanks for reporting him!
74,[removed]
75,I wonder that too. She's really cute even without makeup. She still got a 100% match rate.
76,"You're a ""Stacy"" who was in the Boy Scouts, refers to yourself in other comments as a fat guy, and talks about jerking off. How interesting."
77,"this reminds me of that friends episode where they're having a disagreement about money, ross says idk i've never thought of money as a big deal and rachel says that's because you have it. beautiful people don't understand how much beauty matters because they have it, they've never known what it's like to be without it. i'll give the person in the video the benefit of the doubt that this is one of those gotcha titles but in general i'm tired of stacies telling me the grass isn't greener when we all know that's a bold faced lie."
78,"This reminds me, if any of you guys listen to podcasts, there‚Äôs a recent podcast on Oprah‚Äôs Super Soul conversations talking about beauty called ‚ÄúAging Well with Cybill Shepherd..‚Äù talking about Stacies and how many deny that their looks open doors for them. It was really interesting."
79,[deleted]
80,"Stacies, or even worse gigastacies talking about how looks don't matter and to just be confident is the equivalent of a millionaire preaching to hobos that money doesn't matter."
81,"RANT INCOMING:

OMFG, just *stop*. If I hear one more pretty bitch whine about how their lives aren't perfect because they're attractive, I might just explode in a shriek of rage. No one's saying that ""look's are everything"" but they sure as shit make life easier. This woman will never truly understand what it's like to be treated as if she's a blight on humanity until she's well into her greys and wrinkles and has had a lifetime of privilege and comfort. No one fucking cares, besides maybe fellow hot chicks who want their thoughts validated on a public forum for the world to see.

I'm not saying I have absolute 0% of sympathy for her but it's definitely below the 50% threshold. *Oh, I have a job because of my well-formed genetics, pity me because my life isn't* ***completely*** *perfect.* Eat my ass after a sloppy shit. Talk to me when you're homeless and have people harassing you every day for absolutely no reason other than **fucking existing** near them."
82,"Oh, joy. Another episode of ""Hey, how about I apologize for and act like something that can destroy and control someone's life isn't that big of a deal?""

This is a performance and a diversion--self-soothing means to feel just and good, to relieve themselves of responsibility. The difference between being seen as human and less then to a lazy passing eye and soul, between love and (probably) not, split impressions are the majority of what a person feels about another and breaking out of that frame is incredibly difficult. It's not everything. I never would argue that. But...that's not the problem here.

We have countless stories of this shit and it's twisted--beautiful people conveying ""beauty isn't everything uwu."" If anything it actually teaches the opposite. Pretty people showing proof of how much better they're treated...by being the only ones ""worth"" being shown to the world; a sort of satirical puppet show about the ugly skeletons in the closet.

Saying that you have insecurity problems too as a Stacy doesn't mean much and that girl goes about modeling being awful on a resume or something when her beauty would give her infinitely more flexibility in most walks in life than a deformed woman blessed by God with a Phd who has saved lives.

I won't spite her for rosy goggling but this stuff should really be replaced by people that understand how sneaky and insidious looks prejudice really can be, and help people avoid it. It can poison families, friendships, relationships, and...just existing besides other people. And it isn't just bullies or ""shallow"" people doing it either."
83,I saw this I hate it when attractive people say stuff like that!!
84,"People like this are a huge fucking problem. Males validate everything they say which is ironic since they're only validating them because they look good. I'd love for her to be re-interviewed when she's all old and wrinkled up and talk about how much happier she is being ignored by everyone and having zero opportunities or future because noone wants to fuck her. But of course that's always just blamed on being old, although the real reason is the unfuckability to males, not wrinkles and gray hair in and of themselves. Males get those as well and old males rule society, just look at every government and corporate leadership."
85,Now I‚Äôm going to need her to remake this video but her switching places. With an unattractive woman. Totally would be credible üëåüèæ.
86,"We got shown this at school for ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù to love ourselves or some shit. Put me and my friends in a terrible mood for the rest of the day. I felt so angry,,"
87,Please visit r/Manotears I‚Äôm trying to grow the sub. Also please post some screencaps of entitled moids if you have any.
88,"[Link to the video](https://youtu.be/ks1FEtWlzTU)

The video title is misleading. She's very aware that her looks have opened doors that wouldn't have been opened otherwise. She doesn't talk about how you ""just need to be confident."" She does say however that just because your hot doesn't guarantee you'll be happy or secure."
89,"Have you guys actually listened to the ted talk though? She talks about how her status as a pretty white woman has benefited her. She doesn‚Äôt mean that looks ‚Äúdon‚Äôt matter‚Äù, just that they shouldn‚Äôt but she is aware of how they have actually privileged her throughout her life"
90,I remember enjoying that ted talk but I can‚Äôt remember why. I do vaguely remember that she had a few good points.
91,"It is a bit of a gotcha title. In the video, she is very honest about how she knows she's a model because she won the genetic lottery. She knows that her looks have offered her opportunities in life that aren't offered to everyone."
92,[deleted]
93,this.
94,I don't know who had that idea. She explicitly talks about pretty privilege and it's not really a feel-good video.
95,"Even if she knows that she's gotten unfair opportunities, she couldn't possibly realize the extent in which looks have put her ahead in any situation that has males involved in it, not to mention having zero clue about the horrors women go through for no other reason but their bone structure. So, clueless. Blind leading the blind."
96,Um yeah lol
97,Yeah for once.. someone will date me instead of offering fwb situation..
98,Yeah i know right
99,"I mean, yeah. She's aware as she could be for her situation but ofc she will never truly know."
100,And yet she gets to go up on stage and talk about it as though she has some fucking life lesson to give to the rest of us when in reality it's the other way around.
101,"I think the lesson is that becoming beautiful won't magically solve inner struggles. It ABSOLUTELY opens doors and makes life easier, but if you hate yourself, being pretty isn't necessarily going to solve that."
102,"Okay, well everyone has inner struggles and hates themselves sometimes. Rattling off some generic teen-angst BS about how ""pretty girls still have inNer dArkNess"" shouldn't excuse people from waving away other people's actual, real life struggles."
103,"I agree. People are always going to want to listen to the pretty girl, and even though she wants to express herself, doing so can end up harming others."
104,"Furthermore, if you're an attractive introvert, people will climb over each other to get to know you and would do anything to win your affection. 

If not, you're an arrogant bitch who should be ignored and left to her own devices so she'll learn to come back down to earth and make an effort to ""be nice"" to other people.

At least that was the case for me."
105,"If you‚Äôre an introverted black woman you default to the second one, no matter how pretty you are. You‚Äôll always be thought of as ‚Äúuppity‚Äù and ‚Äúmean‚Äù simply for not being a loudmouth."
106,[deleted]
107,"Lol in high school I was super anti social and this girl one time turned around in middle of class, laughing, and asked me if I was a witch. This post just reminded me of that. I was so embarrassed. I dont even remember what I said back."
108,"I feel like a lot of people mistake gross for ugly or creepy, I don‚Äôt mind if a nice smelling clean ugly guy tried to talk to me compared to some guy in cum stained basketball shorts and a stained t-shirt smelling like he crawled out of the ass crack of dawn, hair looking like a rats nest rebuilt twice over, with teeth blacker than a night with no moon.

Even just a regular amount of self care and presentation makes a huge difference."
109,"I agree. When you are pretty, you are that shy, sweet. cute girl that almost everyone sees in a positive light. When I was fat, it was a much different story."
110,">If not, you're an arrogant bitch who  should be ignored and left to her own devices so she'll learn to come  back down to earth and make an effort to ""be nice"" to other people.

Fuck, I really am ugly."
111,"Honestly, it's sad that black females were expected to act loud, rude, and unkempt, by other black people as well!"
112,Preach sis!!! I don‚Äôt understand how if I‚Äôm loud and what not I‚Äôm ratchet. But if I‚Äôm to quite I have an attitude and I think I‚Äôm to good for ppl üôÑüôÑ
113,Happy cakeday
114,Two of the many epithets which were thrown at me in high school were 'Broomhilda' and 'Helga'. Too bad I grew up in the 80s before being a witch was seen as a good thing.
115,"What does unkempt mean in this context? I come from a place with very few black people, and I do not know the stereotypes."
116,"I sound like such a Uncle Tom re-reading my comment, but I actually mean the opposite. When a black women doesn't wear a weave or straighten their hair they are considered unkempt by black men & women, places of work, and school because of how our natural hair looks."
117,"You don‚Äôt sound like any such thing. What you‚Äôre saying is true. We are expected to look unkempt, to the point of natural hair being considered unkempt (event though it isn‚Äôt)."
118,"Hahaha, thanks. Thankfully natural hair is coming back! I wear my afro i with pride :)))))"
119,I look like this and I'm not even joking.
120,Who leaked a pic of me? Wtf?
121,I remember that oh you will grow into your looks bullshit.
122,LOLLLL
123,too real
124,"I have huge ass lips, but yeah, this is pretty much my face...."
125,"Welp, that just hits home."
126,Who tf stole my pics.
127,MAKE IT STOP.
128,that's me before coffee and makeup
129,damn thought i was looking in a mirror for a second >:(((
130,"I just straight up look like Shrek, or Fiona."
131,I unironically look like this üò≠
132,"HAHA, so true"
133,This is me but more youthful and feminine. XD
134,"As an argentinian the ""mija"" got me but yeah same as when all your classmates breast are growing much faster than yours and they just tell you ""you are just growing slower"" what a sad lie."
135,Same.
136,Same!
137,"Or the typical ""just wait, it will only get better"". 

Aunt,wtf."
138,"Men who do this are the ones that think they will age ""like fine wine"""
139,Wait why doesn‚Äôt he age??
140,"Naomi Campbell literally keeps up with her looks with cocaine and starvation. By aging ""gracefully"", they mean spend tons of money and lifelong dedication in keeping up with your looks but make it look effortless."
141,Just be beautiful. Naturally!
142,"It's always funny to me that supporters of ""the wall"" concept use celebrities as examples. As in rich, often married with kids women. As if their lives are over because they're not fuckable to a general audience anymore. In terms of male revenge fantasies about beautiful young women, ""the wall""-- whether real or not-- is pretty weak in reality.

Still, I know the media and attitudes about aging in general are pretty shit, even to celebrities, which is why they may feel the pressure to go plastic."
143,lol good question
144,"Tbh though, as someone studying to become an RD and who has an ED, that routine wouldn‚Äôt maintain the looks of most people."
145,"I read an article that said that in the 1980s, a model's typical lunch was a Diet Coke and a cigarette."
146,[deleted]
147,"lol I just answered something like that! XD Same here, I invested (and have to continue doing so) a lot of money to make my shitty, dry as a desert and wrinkly getting skin, to look good and healthy. Now people have the nerve to tell me, I am doing nothing to gain this and it is all genetics. Yeah, for sure! Dermarolling, swallowing hyaluronic acid pills, using a hyaluronic acid cream and serum, facial masks and highly hydrating creams from La Roche Posay etc. has so much to do with genetics and doesn't cost a dime or any effort! Right ... This sucks so much but, yeah, the outcome counts. Even if no one cares how you got there and thinks you are a liar, when you try to tell them why your skin all of a sudden looks like that now."
148,"aka Pay thousands every year for expensive beauty products, invest hours over hours to make yourself look good, exercise, but please don't talk about it, because no one wants to hear of it ... Since you got this all naturally!"
149,Still the diet of many of us with eating disorders.
150,Yep. She did an interview recently where said she just discovered exercise like a few months ago smh. Otherwise she can go days without eating and just doesn't think about it. I guess she probably does eat healthy when she actually does eat.
151,"do you think dermarolling is worth it? I got ready to begin and then someone scared me away, indicating it could do permanent damage and leave you scarred and lumpy."

153,"Cocaine, like any other CNS stimulant, kills appetite."
154,"Sorry to all the sisters from those generations, you deserve better than what moids your age are."
155,"Boomer humor is just fucking terrible. It's the epitome of cringy male-centric bullshit memes that old people post on FB and only they find it funny. ""Hahaha I hate my wife!""

GenX is also pretty stupid, but it trends more on stuff that just seems like pointless flaunting of masculinity. Like it reminds me of early 9Gag humor, the weird preoccupation with beards, beer, and bacon, and dumb gatekeeping habits. ""Hahaha I hate my girlfriend!"" too."
156,Boomers and Gen-xers tag team to mock women.
157,"Guys who post this are usually doormats at home. This is their pathetic way to vent. Not that it's any excuse, but because of this I cannot take them seriously."
158,"I‚Äôm Gen X, and friends with many Boomers and Millennials. I can‚Äôt say I see a strong generational pattern in either the kind of fatphobia, ageism, and misogyny illustrated here, or in the bigoted ‚Äòhumor‚Äô of cartoons shared on social media. It does seem to correlate with education level and political leanings, however."
159,"My dad used to go around the house singing ""I married a one ton tomato"".  He used to tell me I should ""run around the block a few times"" because I was getting chubby."
160,Moids of all ages are terrible.

162,"Ah yes, the friendzone 9gag memes were a cesspit of cringe"
163,"GenX is equally disgusting and more ""WOMEN SUCK MY COCK AHAHAHA SEX LE SEX"""
164,"People from different age periods have humor related to their age period, and it can be cribgy sometimes but they can relate to it. Zoomer humor isn't funny. Some memes are just stupid like ""do you know da way"", even tho it was funny for ME. And don't say me that ""I didn't found it funny"", I don't talk about you but about Zoomer humor in general, the same way you talk about boomer humor. And also, it's not boomer humor, it's old people humor, because it's relatable to every generation when they're old."
165,"Perhaps, boomer moids have this extra entitlement, they expect women to do more housework despite working, bc that is how their parents dealt with the household. I see it constantly in fb groups, those two generations of moids were ruined. Younger ones can be 'molded' if you snag them up."
166,"Oh God, yeah. How could I forget the fucking friendzone memes.

I saw those while I was like thirteen in middle school and that was when I began to understand male entitlement."
167,[deleted]
168,So true
169,"Ah yes, socialized to recieve but not give. That's why we can't afford to let them guilt us. IF anytime a moid complains about your housework, you throw that shit right back into his face. Like- how tf can they expect somebody who works 8hrs to clean and cook for them..? And no.. changing the lightbulb or moving a closet once a year is not equivalent."
170,"But Millennials due to social media and porn have much higher physical beauty standards and like choking during sex. Also, most of them are broke. Basically every generation has problems.."
171,Sad but true as well. We must put up ALL the boundaries
172,Moids are triggered when women have preferences just like them

174,"I too am loving all the hidden ""ididntreadthesidebar"" comments.

Btw- OP this meme is hilarious!"
175,"Oh girls, really?! Look at him! He is such a prize! He is almost obligated to have high standards with his amazing looks! lmao"
176,Literally the type of guys who think all women do/could/should look like porn stars with their clothes off.
177," How many men are actually like this though? As long as they have a cute vibe and we share common interests, I couldn't care less what their hip-to-whatever ratio might be."
178,"Ikr, must be men saying it isn't true. God bless the mods <3"
179,"takeout or home-cooked, snacks and drinks while cozy in bed is a way better experience to me tbh--except for when you get too full-sleepy, and it's too warm so you pass out without putting up the food or brushing your teeth. not a fun time."

184,Accurate
185,Ewww
186,"I do have a question though , why do you reply to them in the first place ? Curious - because I get them all the time and I just straight up ignore them. In fact , I don‚Äôt even check my inbox at all lol."
187,"I never said I reply to all of them, I only replied to one of them when I was new to this sub because he seemed nice that‚Äôs it, and then by that experience I learned to never reply to them."
188,"Always liked this comic (aside from the fact that we're supposed to feel bad for the fedora guy)
It's pointless to try to push social acceptance of people who are not conventionally attractive by just expanding the definition of beautiful, or claiming that ""everyone is beautiful"". You will never make that definition wide enough for everyone. There are people who are not attractive, and that's okay. They still deserve respect, and THAT's what we should focus on, instead of giving people balloon egos, inflated but fragile."

193,"> Always liked this comic (aside from the fact that we're supposed to feel bad for the fedora guy)

The Fedora guy is obviously there in a prominent role, because it is possibly the most derided and looked down upon stereotype the internet has left, and this comic is clearly commenting on the fact that prejudiced and judging by looks is still very real.

There are multiple subs and forums pretty much dedicated to slagging off this weird fictional fedora guy that I have literally never seen (I was actually wondering the other day where it came from, are there even people who own Fedoras, never mind wear them? and are there enough to warrant there being a stereotype about it?).

The fact that you agree with this comic *except the Fedora guy* is the exact point the artist was trying to make, and the one that you missed.

If you want to claim that 'all looks are to be respected', then it needs to be all looks, not just 'all looks up until I'm included, because I also want to be able to talk shit about other people'.

At that point it starts being about wanting to be part of the 'in crowd' and not getting rid of the idea of there being an 'in crowd' and that everyone deserves respect."

195,Yeah. Vomit. Some incel drew this.
196,"I‚Äôm extremely late. I came here on a passthrough to look (I‚Äôll figure out how to flair after the comment). 

The only thing on beauty is everyone can *feel* pretty, even those who are unattractive, while knowing they aren‚Äôt pretty. They never phrase it that way in ads, though."
197,"The second thing you said. In fact, I didn't say anything about the other men depicted. (The fact that such a central position was given to the fedora man makes me wonder about the nature of the artist himself.. )"

212,The visceral feeling I got reading this! What can I even say? Your pain is so real to me.
213,I know I don't have a tag yet but my goodness your post was amazing. I almost felt like I wasn't breathing. It was beautifully written and it's like you were able to convey everything I have felt for years.
214,Wow! You know your way around words.
215,That seems like a lot of painful thoughts and feelings to bear alone. Maybe you can see a counsellor or psychologist to talk about it? There are most likely free therapists in your city. Sending you hugs.
216,"I feel this too. And I have always felt this. And who else in my situation can help but to feel cursed and doomed? Life can pretty much be simplified down to surviving long enough to find and impress a mate, procreate, do enough that your offspring survive to do the same, and then die. So I understand your pain. To be undesirable to mates is devastating on a primal level. But here's the thing, in the process of that whole ""surviving long enough to find and impress a mate,"" humans have created a new and wonderfully strange kind of life where we live much longer and within a much cushier society than ever before. We just don't have the same kind of struggles of being eaten, starving to death, freezing, etc. We have time to think and to analyze those thoughts and our emotions, time to cook extravagant meals for others or eat them, to travel to see new sights, to read, to understand others, to try to understand god or the universe or whatever other name you might have for the unknown, and to even muse about our deaths. Life has become so much more than just being a mate to someone. It's so much more than achieving some pseudo immortality through having biological offspring. Life now affords us so much more. It's unfortunate that suffering is such an intrinsic part of life but it's also kind of beautiful and meaningful. Like what does it mean to be denied this part of life? Why are you, and you specifically, this exceptionally intelligent consciousness that walks in a socially rejected vessel? What are you supposed to do with it and why? Our struggles are fuel for creativity, as yours clearly is. There's no better muse or motivator than suffering because it makes us yearn for change. Suffering is the seed of all philosophy and innovation. And what better hand to have this suffering in than your hands that communicate so eloquently what you think and feel. From what I can see, you are far from worthless. You have so much value. There is so much potential in you to reach a far more delicious an enlightenment and a transcendent level of being than there is in the general population. Let yourself want it because you can have it. And you deserve it."
217,Oh you need to be a published writer!
218,"I mean I could‚Äôve written this. I was crying by the end. I also suffer from a hormonal disease that makes me very hairy (my chest is hairy, my boobs are, everywhere basically). I also got probably one of the worst botched rhinoplasties I have ever seen. This feels so weird bc you exactly went through what I did. Right now I‚Äôm on the verge of ending my life. My nose is collapsing and i have never looked this bad before. I wish someone shot me."
219,"You are a very good writer. 

I quit giving two shits about my acne and hairy arms. I even quit wearing a bra. Yes I see those beautiful women and I wonder why am not them but I also feel beautiful exactly how I am, unplucked moustache and all. Crazy hair. Slight sag to the boobs (I barely have any) and everything else.

Nobody is going to love you until you love yourself plain and simple. It is ok to be okay with just being you. You seem endearing and poetic, you are more powerful than you know."

223,"



> I completely get what men see when they look at women. 

I can't put into words how much I agree.






And every day in that state I pass beautiful well dressed men and women, wondering where they're headed, who they'll go home to, their friends, their jobs. Their lives. Their memories. I am a lost soul ready to jump into another body the way a suicide is to jump off a bridge- I can feel my skeleton jolting out of its frame.





I am haunted by countless crushes - bosses, friends, coworkers - that just...lived in another realm. The boss who was 10 years older than me, a COO easily pulling in 250k+ a year, who talked about his wife the way all wives probably hope their husbands do. Picturing what she looks like. All the bright, good-looking, happy, attractive employees in the companies where I worked, who were directors at my age, while I was a fucking shitty worthless temp, treated like garbage in every interview and career-related pursuit I've ever engaged. Every adult social engagement. I spend most of my time with strangers - that's my adult life. Not even regular coworkers, as if spending most of your time with people whose knowledge of your personal life can literally lead to you being unable to pay rent isn't horrible enough.

So many strangers I pass in my city every single day. I stop to turn and stare sometimes, desperate. When you're lonely and miserable and hate your own life - you're on fire, aren't you. You'd do anything to not be yourself. It's beyond curiosity or passing horniness. I am horribly self aware at those moments and feel myself leaving my body, my soul is that goddamned ready to GET OUT. To escape. To follow him.

...He sees Her. The perpetual ""her"" that has haunted me since I was a little girl and understood how important it is to be cute and pretty if you want to be loved, fantasized about the sort of easy friendship, admiration and affection so many women and men have - people who consider themselves average.

All these women that pass me every day, beautiful, and having lived as beautiful, wanted people - make me think about quietly hanging myself in my shower. I could get $100,000 worth of plastic surgery...and with my luck I'd continue to destroy my body and mutilate myself, inch by inch. Be fucking botched.

I curse God - for all of you. The really ugly among you who know what I'm talking about, and know this feeling I'm describing, where after a few years, you don't feel human. You're Cain, and ugliness in this horrible hyper-digital age, this cruel, glossily vapid age is the mark you live under, but you harmed no one.

And shit, ugly men too, who make me feel such horrible guilt. (Do men ever feel bad for ugly women, if they even see them? Does anyone anywhere - anyone but bullies and horrible brutalizing parents/family - see ugly women, friendless and unliked and doomed to lives without touch or love?)

I stand and look more closely at pretty girls than any man ever could and measure her beautiful extremities, all that smooth skin, the line of her back, her smile, her hair, her nose, her beautiful eyes - and each feature is like a counting of all the ugliness contained in my own fucking disgusting person. Fuck - I get it. I get what she does. I am in awe of her - I understand why they seem like dreams come into drab real life, to men. And it makes me hate myself so much, feel so fucking hopeless, I wonder what fucking deity I pissed off that I couldn't just be ""average"".

I have never met a woman that looked like me. Only men. In 30 years on earth I've only seen one woman - near tears, staring at the ceiling, overweight, unquestionably someone with PCOS - who had cystic acne like mine. Certainly not at college.

The hair on my nasty tits, the fucking nasty potbelly blooming repugnant under a narrow concave, strangled rib cage, the perpetual swayback thanks to the surgery.

...What would it be like just to put on a dress that shows your back or stomach or shoulders in August and not feel ashamed or like you might as well be flashing the world, your nasty fucking body is that obscene?

I realized something else too, or muse about it, in the dark - every man that's ever haunted me, who never did more than pity me....as I try to conjure how their bodies would feel under my hands from scant memories of what human skin and muscle even feels like, or try to imagine being held - I wonder if they would change the fact that there is nothing in life or in my mortal dreams that make life bearable. Those fantasies are no longer a comfort - they make me ill. They're unwitting deeply cruel self-mockery. When I come too, back into myself, look at myself - fuck of Christ, tears like glass shards well my eyes.

Why? Because for most people, if they want something - a partner, a job, to learn how to dance, a goal...most of the time, they get it. They accomplish it. They're worthy.

I've never been ""worthy"" of anything I wanted. Water, water everywhere...for everyone else. Femcels? Stranded in the bloody damn desert.

I think, even if being ugly and all the other things about myself that have led me to this horrible, friendless, miserable, sick life didn't matter, if people loved me enough to endure my weakness and reciprocated my feelings for them, if I had the things that tortured me with their total impossibility...would it change the fact that I cannot imagine loving anything in mortal life more than the thought of just fucking being dead already? Would I be less angry? Would it be worth the pain?

But that's the point - the point is being ugly and socialized as an ugly person - or maybe, like me, a fucking stupid person, or an awkward one, one with no talents, nothing of value professionally, no physical grace, nothing other people seem to come by so easy to bring oneself pleasure and to endear oneself to others - all of it deprives you of things you cannot reason away. Romantic love; sex; companionship. Material and psychological comfort. Peace of mind. Unapologetic freedom of expression and movement in your own body. Self-respect. Self-worth.

Hope."

I think the violation of trust and the sense you paid someone to mutilate you, poison your health and make you uglier when other girls are born pretty and get prettier after rhino...you wonder if God is punishing you for something.

Before it settled I thought of killing myself many times. I still do after the hernia surgery.

Also, plenty of people are ineligible for surgery due to chronic health conditions. The flawed genes that create many of these unattractive features often also create serious illness."

Every time I see this I am happy that she clapped back at him and that people laughed at him but, I am sad and sickened that he did this and moreover that it got back to her to where she did clap back at him.

350,i think it's a boy caiman (crocodile) ;)
351,Her jaw? Her eye? I could never.
352,"My bad, HE'S beautiful ü•∞"
353,"With some concealer you could and styling your hair, you could easily look like an offbrand Aubrey Plaza. 
Most Staceys and Beckys are only Staceys and Beckys because they put some effort into it. 

Youre not ugly, youre actually pretty cute. You just need some effort in your appearance"
354,"Good God, if this is what counts as a 'femcel' now, I'm practically a fucking troll in comparison. You look beautiful btw. I would kill to have your features. Don't let any man or woman tell you otherwise."
355,"Oh you were the girl that gave her number to that coffee shop guy and got a text back. I made a comment about how you might have ascended somehow on that post because it didn‚Äôt really make sense to get a text from a cute guy if you are a femcel.

Well, imo, this pic is proof that you are definitely not a femcel. Even without makeup and with a bad angle here you are at least a low tier normie and with some concealer, mascara, lipstick and cute hairstyle you would be at least a regular normie. 

And I am not saying this to be nice. I have seen other posts here and those women were indeed femcels and I never tried to tell them otherwise or invalidate their experience. But girl, you are certainly not a femcel. Maybe not very attractive but still, if you just softmax a bit you will be average easily.

I think social media and beauty standards have ruined some young girls‚Äô self esteem and that is really sad. Try to think about that, honestly."
356,You are pretty ü•∞
357,You‚Äôre so cute!!!
358,"Bruv you‚Äôre a normie rn, could easily go up a few points w the right makeup and your hair down. I‚Äôd kill to have your hair ngl"
359,Your eyes are amazing. The shape is really nice. You just need some makeup and you'll be turning heads. You look cute now just a little unpolished.
360,You look really cute! üíï and so much like phoebe lol
361,Oh my god you are fucking CUTE!!! like you‚Äôre literally adorable as is
362,You arent ugly. Go to a stylist  and learn to use make-up. You could very easily date with some effort
363,You're actually attractive
364,"FFS. If you‚Äôre comparing yourself to, I don‚Äôt know, a Kardashian or something then yeah of course, you‚Äôre apples and oranges. But with a bit of styling and grooming you could totally rock the Aloof Hipster Chick look that PLENTY of guys go batshit for. 

This is the reason I don‚Äôt treat ‚Äúfemcel‚Äù and ‚Äúugly girl/woman‚Äù as interchangeable terms, because your looks aren‚Äôt the problem here. You‚Äôre average, with a slight boost because you‚Äôre young, and like I say, your version of looks maxing is more Aloof Hipster Chick or Hot Nerd. 

Also, like other older femcels are saying below, you‚Äôre SO YOUNG. I feel legit empathy for you baby femcels but statistically a lot of you aren‚Äôt as far behind the bell curve as you feel you are, and statistically it is just too early for most of you to be writing off the possibility of love and sex lives. If you‚Äôre past 30 and still ‚Äúnever been kissed‚Äù, loved, or had sex that wasn‚Äôt an extremely bad decision? Then we can talk. <3"

366,"You look young as hell, you‚Äôre not even remotely close to what would be considered ugly here so stop beating yourself up. We know what real ugly is and come on, be truthful, a little acne and mussy hair isn‚Äôt what being ugly really is about and you know it.

Now this doesn‚Äôt however not make you femcel, maybe more volcel or even mentalcel, I would say a healthy dose of cynicism and not letting anyone convince you to wear makeup to play pretend stacy will do you wonders in the long run.

If you were IRL Phoebe your skin would be darker and splotchy, your nose would be upturned, large, and flat, and your eyes would either be too small or spaced too far apart. I personally don‚Äôt want to put down women for their looks but there are plenty of examples of actually ugly woman."
367,Prettttty
368,"Tretinoin, vitamin C, and sunscreen.  Grow out your bangs and hair, start playing with makeup and confidence.  Start going to a gym.   You are not ugly, if you are a femcel it is 100% a choice."

Excuse me while I kill myself bye"
373,"Bruh you're really cute???? At least better looking than I'll ever be, I'd kill to look like that."
374,"you are cute as hell, that's what you are."
375,"You're fine, don't be silly."
376,"you literally have this trending lips that's trending here in Korea that people get fillers to get - you have them naturally and I'm so jealous

also you're not ugly you're actually naturally pretty"
377,"ur really really pretty! you have that art hoe look to you and that‚Äôs super in rn 

idk how you can call yourself a femcel"
378,"Wait, did you draw Phoebe to your image or is this coincidence?"
379,You have lovely features and the most gorgeous thick hair. Are the curls natural? They're stunning. I spend ages trying to get my hair curly like that and it hardly ever does.
380,"[This is why most femcels don't post their pictures online.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Communitycels/comments/ehfevp/this_is_what_a_femcel_looks_like_btw)

384,Ur art is amazing wow. Do u have an ig act for it??
385,"I honestly think you are super cute! With makeup you would be a high-tier normie, and you definitely fall into the normie tier with no extras. :)"
386,I see a better palate than I have to work with. You are cute.
387,Adorable
388,"Are you brazilian? Cause if you are, I 100% get why you consider yourself a femcel even tho you are cute"
389,"I think you should get a blood test and your overall health checked, to improve your skin. Perhaps you have anemia and that‚Äôs making your skin pale. 

Other than that your face is cute, you can definitely be attractive if you attend to your health."
390,"Same sis, same."
391,"you are very cute and a pretty face. Interesting type. Just get rid of the bangs and do some skin care, microneedling for example. But you are very young. It will get better when you get older. 

And cleanse your face two times a day."
392,Phoebe?
393,Are you fucking kidding me...
394,[removed]
395,Also with your skin tone you might find that a red concealer works best for undereye stuff. Im pale af an basically use an almost white concealer for my undereye area. Genetics are a bitch sometimes.
396,"This! You have the foundation there, you just need to put more effort into your beauty routine. With a little styling your hair would be fire."
397,also hair routine! She‚Äôs got some gorgeous ringlets that of understood can turn into a cute curly bob
398,"Agree 1,000%. She also looks YOUNG and i'm so sad when i see babies here, they are too young to even know if they are doomed, and most aren't but the feeling that you are doomed is something that can doom a person and often people who could easily ascend give up before their facial structure has finished maturing.

She also calls herself fat in a later comment, which 1) is changeable and 2) is not that bad if the pic is any indicator. looking down without a double chin and non-chubby hands has me thinking this is just a normal young woman beaten into self-hatred thru a combination of introversion and instagram reality poisoning self-perceptions."
399,"You say this, but my experiences says otherwise. I am not desired, I don't have a boyfriend, no boy ever approached me and I've been severely bullied for looking like a ""zombie"" when I attended school. When wearing make-up I look average, but even with make-up I dont get anything more than a few looks. And besides that, I'm fat. I wouldn even get to be a Becky. And the guy that sent me a message wasn't very attractive, either. If he was, I would have never approached him."
400,"No kidding, natural ringlets? So jealous!!"
401,Omg the maker has spoken
402,"Okay, be honest now! Your soul wanders off when you sleep and when you wake up, you draw what you saw there, right?"
403,Lot of larpers
404,I feel the same way lol
405,The nose is what I hate most... It has a big ball-like tip and is so greasy no matter what skin products I use. And the tip is where acne grows the most :(
406,/u/greenteaapplepie69 drew the original.
407,"god, they‚Äôre disgusting. i‚Äôm not a violent person but fuck would i love to slap them"
408,"Just saw yay you are brazilian, if you are southern brazilian this makes even more sense. Dont worry about the other ladies who are tryna make your femceldom less valid, they are probably looking at you with a different culture eyes, this happens a lot

Fora Bolsonaro"
409,femcel phoebe. you can find posts here about it.
410,"They're not lying though. She looks average here, and I agree that it looks like she's making zero effort. With some effort she could easily be above average. She could shape her eyebrows a bit, work on a simple skincare routine, fix her hair, put on a little makeup, and look very pretty."
411,this is a moid
412,She's not fat at all; she's a normal healthy size for her age.
413,"As someone who has seen both sides of the coin (I used to be average, then a Stacey, then a fatcel and now I am a Becky trying to lose some last weight and groom myself better in order to be a Stacey again), please try to hear me out.

You just admitted that you can look average with makeup, which is undoubtedly true. Average is way different than being a femcel. Being a femcel defines you to an extent. That‚Äôs not to say that 4-5/10 women do not experience the effects of lookism of course. And yes, that‚Äôs the attention most average looking women get: a few glances here and there and approaches every now and then by creepy/old men. 

What I am trying to say is that at your level of attractiveness it should be easy for you to not let your appearance define who you are as a person. But you are choosing to let it. I know you have suffered from lookism too, I know your life would be better, more effortless if you were more attractive and that‚Äôs why you probably identify in this community but dealing those feelings the way you seem to be, is not healthy for you or your self esteem.

It seems like you are blaming things on your looks that are not your looks‚Äô fault. That won‚Äôt help you grow and be a happier, better version of yourself. Take a look at r/trunormies, maybe you‚Äôll identify with that sub a little more."
414,"Here's some truth:

You sound like a volcel- not just because you could lose weight if you really think that's the problem (given your pic i don't, you have a cute face and it's obvious you're not THAT overweight given your hands and neck), but because you sound like you're not trying despite being unhappy with your circumstances. I know you tried in terms of giving that guy your number (good job! and he texted! he wouldn't have if you were a no for him, that's objective proof you're considerable for him), i meant tried to address the things about yourself you feel make you a femcel. What is your glow up plan?

How old are you? I want to be supportive of people feeling unloved/unloveable at any age, but honestly, it's hard for people under a certain age to be so certain they are undesirable when they haven't had a chance to explore the world or meet many people from outside their school bubble. 

Lose some weight, work on being more comfortable existing in public, ask yourself what about your behavior is making folks say you act like a zombie, and come back if you hit your mid-30's having addressed all of that and still never having had a boyfriend. 

You're cute. maybe make some videos of yourself and analyze them for how you might be coming off as a ""zombie"" or ""weirdo"". Doing this for myself helped me realize how shit my posture is if i'm not paying attention, and how much that makes a difference between me looking normal vs looking like i'm a mentally impaired troll woman."
415,"I know it sounds like a terrible cliche but smiling can help a lot as regards getting people to be less judgemental.

When you mix with people you have to try and empty your mind of negative thoughts - almost like giving yourself a frontal lobotomy and pretending you think all's well with the world and you have nothing but happy happy thoughts in your head.  You put on a sort of half smile to make yourself seem like you're confident and  at ease with your surroundings and want to fit in despite how you might really feel inside.  This does actually convey the very opposite of how I feel toward society but I have found that people are less likely to pick on me if I do it.  Try it anyway as if you convey an angry or sulky and unhappy look people will tend to dislike you and bullies will target you.

You're definitely not fat either.

You have a good facial structure - far more normal looking than mine and you seem generally pretty normal so you should make the most of your advantages.  I can guarantee that if you are seen smiling and laughing by others when out and about some people will take a liking to you.

Post another photo of yourself with makeup on and smiling/laughing - show your teeth -  I bet you will look really pretty."
416,"Your nose has a pretty shape. Just accept the compliments, gosh."
417,You'd love your nose if you had mine!  Appreciate what you have - it's a very normal looking nose - this is a major win!
418,I don't use skin products at all - each morning and night I wash my face with warm water with a face flannel.  Often the skin products can cause spots if your skin is very sensitive.  As long as you get the oil off your skin and make sure you rub areas like round the nose and chin with warm water so the pores are kept clear your skin will be ok.  When you wear makeup you need to take more time to remove every trace with flannel and warm water too.
419,"sorry, but no. she could be average at most."
420,are you implying that only men can be rational?
421,I think you're being pessimistic but even if you're right average is not femcel/ugly.
422,"""at most"" means if she tried her hardest to look good. i asked multiple people who aren't aware of these types of communities to rate her and they all gave her a 2/10. it's funny that i'm being downvoted to oblivion when most regular people would agree with me."
423,"You're actually claiming that a bunch of perfectly normal people rated a young girl with no actual deformities, a full head of hair, and very mild skin imperfections as a 2/10. So then what does a 1 look like? What you're saying literally makes no sense."
424,"She is clearly trying to look ugly here. Her hair, expression, lack of makeup. She can fix all that in a day and be a normie which is completely different from being a femcel. I can take pictures looking almost as bad if I try too."
425,"yes, they did. i don‚Äôt agree that she‚Äôs a 2. normies throw around ratings like that without taking truly ugly people into consideration when ranking people from 1-10, but the point is that she looks below average."
426,"kind of inspired by zashienana's femcel.

460,What is the difference then between a skinny girl who doesn‚Äôt work out and a girl who is skinny fat? The assumption for the latter is that a girl who is skinny fat still has fat in undesirable places? Like a bit of tummy and love handles or something.

527,"i really love this comic, just wanted to say that. is it yours or do you have the credit?"
528,"I love your art üíï
And I relate to this a lot. I look different in different mirrors, pictures angles, lighting ect; it drove me crazy. Eventually I just decided to accept that I was ugly and stop looking. 

I used to take hundreds of selfies in different lighting just to figure out how I looked. I had to look at myself in the reflections of windows and in bathroom mirrors at different places. It really fucked me up."
529,"I hated the camera for many years and would often dread having to be seen in photos I can‚Äôt change. Though I would always stick close to a mirror so I could look my best at every single moment. Going to class, skipping class, lunch break, bathroom break, & even in my home where I could spend hours upon hours analyzing myself. I still dislike taking photos now unless I edit to where I look presentable."
530,"This is exactly how I feel, I look in the mirror and I just see something different every day.

Sometimes I feel almost pretty even though I know nobody else views me that way, sometimes I feel extremely hideous

And yet no matter what kind of pictures I take those are universally ugly to me, even if I feel pretty that day in the mirror

It's like I don't know what I look like or I can't see what I look like"

532,Fantastic. You should probably share it to r/altcomix!

548,"Exactly. Cannot stress this enough. Men are more uniform in opinions and desires from women so when you have a group of men that you know wont date you and only want sex and you are lonely... the only way to choose between them is looks... and obviously going for the one most attractive is the reasonable thing to do.

Women are a lot more forgiving with traits in men. Sure, ugly men may have to work harder, but there is a chance.

For women, ugly girls can work as hard as they want, it usually doesnt matter. Men will always try to trade up."

Everyone keeps saying how similar we are, but somehow I look like a potato. We share a lot of traits that are considered ugly, but while they make my mom unique, they are just a bit exagerated on me: slightly too prominent nose (after my father), a bit too recessed jaw, even smaller boobs. If I got my mom's face genes and my dad's body genes, I could be a model. But no, my brother got this combination and is damn chad."

(Cue pickme piping up she LOVES porn and laughing in agreement) 

I'm ok with kinks being normalized but the truth is, so long as good looking people practice it - this shit has been normalized since at least the 90s.

In the age of phony sex positivity, nobody realizes ""kink"" as an obligation - one women usually have to accept, acted upon by men - isn't actually sex positive. Nor is the ongoing shaming of adult virgins. 

I could rave about this for hours. Every Stacy and Chad goes ON AND ON about how they have anxiety and depression (none of it makes them kinder people, of course, or less judgmental!), they love getting karma points talking about the year in their life they wore braces....and yet it's never been more acceptable to celebrate prejudice against people for being conventionally unattractive or unphotogenic/feeling uncomfortable being photographed. People are stupid fucking narcissists who love shaming others like its a national pastime. Maybe it's always been that way but it's so strange to me how that goes on in the age of the tearful, shittily-written Personal Essay.

The normalizing of porn in culture and the impetus to be DTF and game makes looksism, adult virginity, and simply drawing boundaries so much worse."

They have no real passion in life, no work to throw themselves into, they are too stupid to be true creators.


So now they try to feel better by shitting on other women, trying to convince themselves that they are not below average, it's just that women are dumdums in general! No, not all of us are losers. Just them :)

Well, anyone is allowed to have a sub fetish, and enjoy same. 

Dominatrix is a job, some men like being subs, too.

The issue is when men see a woman who happens to have a sub fetish, and then say ""see? that womans' personal relationship preferences are how ALL WOMEN SHOULD ACT, for the pleasure of my cock!""

A further issue is when women have low self esteem and don't actually have a sub fetish, they just think they need to compensate for their apparent shortcomings by being subservient/subs, even tho they don't actually like it. That's people lying to themselves, and is just as bad as a gay person forcing interest in a straight relationship because ""at least i'm not lonely"". 

We really need to free ourselves of the notion that anything is better than nothing, when it comes to relationships."

678,"i just saw this on twitter

the guys in the comments were throwing a tantrum lol"
679,"True, you don‚Äôt know how many normies or ugly guys I‚Äôve seen with stacies omgg, because imo women aren‚Äôt that into looks like men, we fall in love with things more deep beyond physical appearance, and men typically fall in love after they‚Äôve liked your physical appearance. Also I‚Äôve seen many times where the girl wears the cutest outfits has her hair done and nails too... and then the guy is wearing really normal or bad clothes, it‚Äôs ok to wear normal clothes but if your girl is always wearing nice clothes just try to look cute for her too."

682,black women are the most pink pilled. we've been dealing with treacherous men our whole lives.
683,"It‚Äôs true.

Men can be ugly because they have money, status, and (maybe)height to fall back on."
684,Lol so true.
685,"I really would like it if we forgot the whole ""pill"" thing and make up our own terminology. This is feminism, just not the mainstream pick-me type feminism where feminism just means that Stacy gets to have someone give her a job for her looks, not acknowledge it and everyone calls it empowerment. 

Stacies and upper tier beckies know what's up but they benefit from it. There is no pill to take for them. It's only unattractive women that are kept in the dark as to the advantages of being attractive and fed BS about confidence and other shit to keep the status quo going. This is done by other women.

So yeah, it resonates with everyone because everyone can see who males give what treatment to. Males don't hide it. But so long as Stacies are getting everything they want there will never be any mainstream backlash against lookism. Life is just way too good for women who are pretty."

 I don't see what imposter syndrome has to do with being a Stacy, absolutely everybody goes through that and some of us don't get praised for anything we do while Stacy can spend the whole day on Insta and at the end of it do some half-assed little task and every male around is in awe. 

But boo-hoo Stacy is insecure so how about us peasants not say anything and suffer in silence so she doesn't throw a tantrum about how jealous older women are such meanies making her feel bad."
692,">because you‚Äôre competent or because someone thought you‚Äôre hot. 

I heard so many women saying as long as they have the upper hand it's okay to just use their looks. The denial is real cause deep inside I don't think one has the thought of who doesn't benefit the way I do because they lack something out of their control."
693,Thanks ‚ù§
694,"No one who goes into a field to excel wants to be known because they‚Äôre attractive. I‚Äôd rather be seen as competent.

695,"I‚Äôll be real- I used to be incredibly hairy and my mom would not let me shave whatsoever. I don‚Äôt mean like a bit of armhair- I mean dark hair on my cheeks... People actively bullied me. I got laser hair removal multiple times and while the hair is still there, it‚Äôs very sparse. I was lucky enough to have good facial features and work out regularly to maintain my body. I wasn‚Äôt always ‚ÄúStacy‚Äù so I know what my looks have done for me."
696,"Yeah ugly women are never thought of as incompetent because they're women /s 

Look, it's better to get paid and be viewed as a useless bimbo than get minimum wage and have to do said bimbo's job and get yelled at on top of that. If you don't agree, well, good luck to you on whatever planet you're living on."
697,I am hairy as well with extremely bad facial features. Despite the hairy part you say you have great facial features. Stacy inherently has great facial features.
698,"‚ÄúWork out regularly to maintain my body.‚Äù

THIS is the sort of thing that looks-privileged women say because they actually believe that women with unattractive bodies aren‚Äôt engaged in just as much exercise (and food restriction) as they are. (There‚Äôs a reason that anorexia occurs most often in fat women.)

Faux-feminism is imagining that one lives differently, and better, than women who are considered unattractive."
699,"They didn‚Äôt matter when I was completely covered in thick, black hair."
700,Yea except I don‚Äôt believe that. Plenty of women in my family eat healthy and exercise but have issues with thyroid (something that‚Äôs possibly in my future as well.) I can honestly tell you that my life IS better and has become better since I got the laser hair removal. I don‚Äôt get pointed out and laughed at anymore. That‚Äôs just my personal experience.
701,Same with me. I'm just saying that I wish I had a decent face. Having an ugly face and being hairy just makes me look like a human beast....it's not a great feeling cause I don't have any other qualities I can substitute.
702,"Oh, I‚Äôm sure your life is better after the hair removal - mine is too (I had the same issue).

If you don‚Äôt believe that body appearance is a product of working out, then you‚Äôre more-knowledgable that most Stacies. But making statements like you did above promote the same myths. We don‚Äôt get to choose our body types/weights. Working out is great for your health, but that‚Äôs not what the statement implies."
703,"Looking back at it, it‚Äôs absolutely insensitive and I apologize! Clean diet and exercise definitely make you healthier but achieving the ideals set for women is only possible for some/few women."

Now gamers fight ""women and other minorities"" and ""feminazis"" who ruin their games, also leftist journalists, especially female journalists. It's often organized, sponsored by right-wing politicians, vicious. So the hate inside gaming is very real.

I used to have anxiety so bad I wouldn‚Äôt leave the house. But now I‚Äôm not afraid to show my face anymore. Sometimes I feel like I look exactly like that yafayette (is that her name? Piglet) girl from the Witcher...but I just learned to accept that I don‚Äôt have money for plastic surgery so I just have to get over it. Life is too short to not enjoy it because people are assholes."
723,"Wholesome,well done."
724,GOALS üíì thanks for posting thisüò≥
725,This made me feel better:‚Äô)
726,Realistic life goals right here.
727,"I'm ugly and I'm proud. No really, this is great. I think I would be this if I could 

1) get an actual career instead of working a minimum wage part-time job

2) get my own apartment instead of living in such a terrible place.

2) get some treatment for depression and anxiety that is due to being so poor, having no friends, and growing up with a horribly abusive and downright evil father.

I mean, I already have library/movies/going out by myself down to a finesse. I have always known I am ugly since I was a little girl, and it's never really bothered me. I usually do wear what I want, and I have my own hobbies. 

And I love all of it. 

All I really want is in the list above, plus some friends every now and then! Never wanted a boyfriend, and probably never will."
728,This is me. Already know I‚Äôm a femcel and living my life without societal rules.
729,If you don't stop with these quality memes
730,"Heads up to the femcels in their 20s from a 36 year old big sister: do your best to start working towards this. Statistically you‚Äôll experience at least one kind of romantic sexual relationship in your life, even if it doesn‚Äôt last, but in case you don‚Äôt, or it doesn‚Äôt last, this is a healthy long term femcel goal. Hang in there, you got this. <3"
731,Do you know me personally? üò≠
732,"üëèüèº Goals. I‚Äôm about 3/4ths way there. I don‚Äôt have a ton of money so I can‚Äôt dress how I‚Äôd like, but I‚Äôve like 80% mentally chosen to be a confident ‚Äúfugly‚Äù so that I can stop giving a fuck about what other people think. There‚Äôs so much more freedom to being imperfect, like you have more space to move around. That‚Äôs paraphrasing what ShittyRobots girl said about her work btw, but it‚Äôs true for looks too."
733,"Honestly tho, I wish everyone that sort of life!"
734,"The toxic friends part is kinda odd. I‚Äôve noticed a lot of ugly girls are really narcissistic, me kinda included but I recognize when I‚Äôm pushing it. I had an acquaintance cut it off with me who fits this profile pretty much, because I had a different political opinion. A lot of relationships that shouldn‚Äôt have mattered so much to people are ended with the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing what‚Äôs best for me...‚Äù Making somebody listen to why you don‚Äôt like them for a half hour isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs best for both of you. Tell me to buzz off and just go do something for once in your miserable life. I feel like a lot of femcels feel like they are smarter than stacies, but boy they can be equally as needy and borderline retarded, if they never get their egos checked."
735,I'm very pleased to see something so positive from you! :)
736,I think her name is yennifer.
737,No problem! üíï
738,üíïüíïüíï
739,Thanks!
740,Yasss you‚Äôre preaching sis. Even since I decided  to have confidence. I got scouted by a modelling agency. If I can do it you can too üí™.
741,"I can attest to this meme. When I stopped being shy and showed my true colors to the world, my face started shining and my skin turned white from green, my ogre ears disappeared, and everyone stopped treating me like a hideous beast. Only because I'm confident now, not because I look different. (: 

On a more serious note, Jesus fuck that palate. I'm not even entirely sure if that's fixable."
742,"And lose 150 lbs, get veneers, $100k of plastic surgery, color contacts, thousands of dollars worth of therapy, a new wardrobe, etc etc etc"
743,"Damn, the girl on the right could be me. The only thing holding me back is the fact that I never have showered a day in my life and I couldn't figure out how this ""just smile"" thing works."
744,"if i wasn't born to a poor family, i could have possibly afforded some plastic surgery and braces and ascended to normie status. unfortunately that didn't happen. and i live life as a ugly adult."
745,I lowkey wish i never found this sub in like a blissful ignorance way lol
746,"The fact That there are so many women like the one of the right makes me want to kill myself x1000. 

Jesus fucking Christ - at this stage I would just kill to have straight, not-disgusting teeth and have them show when I smile. 

That woman doesn't even look real, but - even with some filtering - of course she is"
747,"Gosh the girl on the right, so fragile and feminine. I died inside as soon as I saw it.  


Can you guys use trigger warnings on pictures like these please? :("
748,"Sweaty lol  (lol reminds me of when someone used to tell me sweat dreams lol) and it sucks to know if I had money I could have improved my appearance and had a much better life by now, I been told plenty of times I have a nice personality but that still doesn't do the trick, people still don't see me as the girl on the right lol"
749,"I sometimes wonder if being skinny is the only thing men care about these days. Cardi B, Saoirse Ronan and Jessica Parker have similar faces to the girl on the right and honestly aren't pretty. But men go crazy for them. 
But otherwise if the girl on the left fixed her teeth and worked on the smile I think she would be ok looking."
750,"ikr. even if she lost weight, it'd take some serious surgery for her to ascend."
751,Get out of my swaaamp üò§
752,But shrek is sexy as fuck.
753,"A skincare routine, Flawless Make up, Confidence.

So be yourself means becoming what society considers to be conventionally attractive and if your not born that way, you have to go broke to achieve that."
754,Hmmmm...I don't know about that one.
755,Girl you‚Äôre crazy. Saoirse Ronan is beautiful I wish I looked like her
756,LOL
757,"The camera also has unflattering angle I think. 
But for real I like Cardi B but it amazes me she was a stripper. I think she's kind of ugly tbh üôÑ"
758,"I've had guys I dated tell me the same thing, how she's pretty but I'm average. But you know what chubby is more attractive then bones sticking nearly out of ones cheeks. 
Edit: it's a matter of knowing ones worth."
759,[deleted]
760,[deleted]
761,morbidly obese is such an exaggeration. I'd say being a size 6-8 with an opulent chest and round butt is better than being skinny. But not overweight. People hate overweight ppl... I see it literally every day even if you're not morbidly obese.
762,Eh I don't know. Seems like women with anorexia and bulimia get their pick of guys who worship the ground they walk on. I am aware these women have mental health issues and I wish soceity helped them more but they have their pick of men. I'm only chubby with big breast and get guys who won't even look at me. Think it hugely depends from person to person.
763,"To be fair, women with ED are mentally ill, so the better treatment they get from people could be exaggerated or imagined."
764,"depends on the location. i am an ascended becky. in southern europe and east asia very skinny women are considered hot, especially in fashion cities like Milan or Paris or Tokyo. in northen europe or latin america not so much."
765,"There is no ""just got into med school"". This is HUGE!!! Congratulations and you rock!!!"
766,"Congrats!!! Medical school is a HUGE feat! If you can get into med school, you can do anything!"
767,Congratulations!! Yeah I wouldn't mind if I could get a robot bf like in Detroit: Become human.

772,CONGRATS!! That's a huge achievement right there :D
773,"That's incredible! I always wanted to be a doctor as a little girl. And robot bfs are my dream. You better make that shit happen. No male getting any of that money you made! My plan would be, become incredible doctor, make tons of money, invest in robots or VR, gain perfect relationship created by technology, live happily ever after with my metallic prince."
774,"femcels can't asce-

775,Congrats! Getting into med school is super hard. Treat yourself and celebrate. You've worked hard for this!

790,thank youuu
791,"Thanks! Right now no clue, although I do have some areas I seem to have interested in more than others! Emergency medicine sounds cool. I think many students figure out their preferred specialty ~4th year."
792,Hellz yeah!! Hit the books before worrying about your looks ;D
793,"Honestly I figured if i never have a hubs and kids, I might as well contribute to society in some way üôÑ thank you!!"
794,thanks!!! :D
795,Thank you :) It's funny cuz I only wanted a husband and kids as a child. Never imagined I'd go this route lol.
796,thanksss ;D
797,Haha yes already planning my next vacay ;D I haven't had a life in SO long. Thank you!!

806,"Thank youuu. I had a bit of a non-traditional path actually. I started out in pharmacy school, then transferred schools and switched to Bio/Premed. I also minored in criminal justice funny enough"

809,"ER doctors are true heroes, it would be very fulfilling to serve as a ""first line of defence"" and save lives every day, I think! 

...plus, who knows...one day you just might end up saving the love of your life. :)"
810,I never wanted a wedding or a traditional family for even a second. Guess I'll be getting a proposal soon :D
811,You inspire me.  Enjoy it.  You deserve your moments. This is just one.  To this and all the ones to come (( hugs ))

815,"I don't remember college admissions too well because that was several years ago, but the youngins I know are applying early decision or admissions soon, and regular decision is due like January or February.

So amazing.  I think the glasses are makeup too."
826,"This is from the webtoon, true beauty, love it very relateable. "
827,then drool over the hot supermodels on t.v that look like they are not wearing make up but actually have 20 make up products on 
828,Some days it's just easier to go without makeup though. My town isn't exactly filled with beauty queens especially over a certain age. In some places it seems anything but the most natural of makeup looks out of place.
829,Gonna be honest. Girls with makeup almost always look better than those without it. Though there is such thing as too much makeup but most girls know enough about it for it to not be a problem. 
830,"i have some make up but i hardly wear it in daily life. and if so only a hint of lipstick and mascara nothing much. Because I see no point in trying to make myself look ""hot"" because sooner or later he will see your true face anyway. But I try to have relatively clean skin by using skin care regularly."
831,"Or when older women are like ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you invest in some skincare instead,‚Äù like honey I already did. I‚Äôm VIB rouge for a reason. "

most people with a working organ in their skull realize that makeup on the whole makes people look better."

853,"I wonder how the girl in the right is doing, you know? I just hope she is okay."
854,Literally just existing as an ugly person makes you vulnerable to all sorts of vile abuse. I hate it.
855,THE reason why I don't take pictures. Imagine how she must feel if she's still breathing. Her success is marked by this.
856,"This is so sad, she's probably having such a great time 

Sometimes I really hate being a woman, everything we do people make it about our looks."
857,"she literally did nothing and she's been made into a meme just because she's not pretty. just existing as an ugly person makes people hate you and abuse you - it's like they don't even view her as a person, just something to taunt and bully."
858,"I feel so bad for very tall girls. I think they're cool BC they look strong, but every single one I've ever met was very insecure. Men come down on them super hard to break their spirit BC she actually poses a threat to them on a basic level."
859,"Yeah, how dare she exist and not be appealing to moids. I just can‚Äôt."
860,"Don't care what anyone else says, she looks cool and awesome to me."
861,I‚Äôm pretty sure he looks like a sack of balls. It‚Äôs always the scum of the earth who likes to talk about others knowing good and well they‚Äôre no prize either
862,"Disgusting...that's bullying at its finest, I've seen many forums taking pictures of not attractive people and making fun of their looks in herd like sheeps. High-school kind of mindset, picking every single flaws and trying to throw lame jokes like that one.

I would like to know how's this girl, how's her social life and self esteem...the fact that she's smiling interestes me. I never smile because I dislike myself, but she seems so confident."
863,If anyone‚Äôs an orc it‚Äôs him.
864,Feels
865,"I remember this time some attractive women were trying to make me take photos with them. Uh uh devil, not today"
866,I bet he thinks hes so funny
867,I don't find her unattractive.
868,[deleted]
869,I don't take pictures as well
870,"""Well becozz she doesn't look like someone who'll take any mess that I do so.... I'll just make fun of her because it elevates my ego"""
871,tall girls with long hair are my life fuel
872,"not everyone can be beautiful, and that's okay. people still deserves kindness and respect regardless"
873,I honestly think you‚Äôre being overly optimistic in her case
874,This is such a weird comment. Not the fact that you don't find her unattractive. But the fact that you're like all she needs is a few cosmetic surgeries costing thousands of dollars and she'll be pretty. Such an odd thing to say about someone else. Especially when it's your opinion on her. Not her own opinion or wants. So YOU alone think those procedures will make her attain true beauty in YOUR eyes as if your eyes are the only ones that matter.
875,This is exactly the point. Being a douche and being a scumbag to someone just because one doesn't like the way they look is immoral
876,"She could definitely look more decent with surgery, that‚Äôs true, I can‚Äôt visualize if she would be plain ugly or closer to average, but that‚Äôs not even the point. The comments in the post are brutal!

Does she really have to save thousands for years, undergo literal SURGERIES in order to be treated as a human? That‚Äôs disgusting, I don‚Äôt even know how people write these comments and feel good for themselves."
877,"""Feminism has ruined western women"" ""Asian women have better family values""

*goes to Thailand to fuck trafficked underage trans prostitutes because family values* "
878,"So true.  Not too long ago I went there on holiday with my parents. I was appalled by the creepy men who I saw dating far prettier Thai girls, boys, women and men, who often seemed far too young for them.
Thailand is such a beautiful country in every other way."
879," As an Asian woman living in the US, yellow fever really is the most insulting shit. Too many creepy white men making you wonder what you've done wrong to attract these people. "
880,"Feminism has ruined western women hahahhaah 
Yea u cant even have multiple wifes you can assault life is not fair"
881,"also r/justneckbeardthings would be a good fit for this meme........ 

yeah, gross moids! yuck!"
882,Literally so fucking disgusting. It‚Äôs not even just for Asian women. They go to Thailand for underage Asian trannies & underage girls that are literally slaves. 
883,LMFAOOOOO
884,I thought I was on the 90 day fianc√© subreddit for a second
885,Add Andrew Anglin‚Äôs face here
886,"I live in a scandinavian country and you have no idea the amount of men here married to much younger thai women. They're not minors but from my observations, these women are here without speaking the language and alone with these older men far away from family. This is so prevalent that I wonder if these men bought these women to their poor families or if there's a Russian bride type of business. Some of them look happy but others just seem miserable."
887,"So far I discovered two reasons for this (creepy white men with yellow fever)

They see Asian women as more subordinate and less stuck up

or anime "
888,"There's this stereotype that Asian women are not ""ruined"" by the female emancipation movement of the western countries. Many men will only go for Asian women because they see them as submissive, easy to manipulate and excellent house wives. Aside for some men's creepy Asian pedo fetiches, I think this is the main reason.

It's objectifying."
889,"Honestly, I was told when I was younger that Asian women have sideways vaginas. I've never verified the for myself, but I guess some people are dedicated to the research."
890,"I had a guy try to use ""I like Asian girls"" as a pick up line before. It didn't work at all. "
891,"Can‚Äôt call black people the n word anymore

I miss the good ole days!!!1!1!1!"
892,And here I am an Asian feminist lol.

896,">   stuck up

https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Stuck-Up you mean no?first time eharing that"
897,Yes I‚Äôm aware of this. That‚Äôs why I said yellow fever was insulting. I‚Äôve been dressing myself ‚Äúgayer‚Äù in an attempt to break those stereotypes. And a lot of Asian women today hate to be associated with that kind of vocabulary too.
898,Where do u live? Never heard that in my life but that‚Äôs fucking hilarious 
899,have you also heard the one about Asian women having two vaginas so they can fuck two guys at once and earn double the money (because all Asian woman are whores obvs) /Asian woman
900,"Underage boys are literally human trafficked into Thailand and forced to ‚Äútransition‚Äù which literally leaves them with mutilated bodies and infertile, so their handlers, the government, and businesses can make money off of them while they are getting raped. 

Idc people supporting transgenderism in the United States and other countries are promoting, encouraging, and supporting this behavior. It‚Äôs disgusting. And high key pedophilia considering they want boys as young as 5 years old to go on hormone blockers so they never go through puberty and can keep their little boy bodies forever. "
901,"When you call someone stuck up it means that person is arrogant and sees themselves superior those around them. 

It‚Äôs basically another way of saying calling someone a snob or snobbish.

905,"I was actually born in fort Sill Oklahoma, hmmm..."
906,Yup. :/
907,"I never got magical spinsteress powers at 30 :(

I just got more invisible."
908,I‚Äôd change the false platitudes about ‚Äúsomeone for everyone‚Äù to family and friends telling you about a woman they knew who never married but ‚Äúhad a very happy life on her own.‚Äù
909,The 2 or none friends is so true. I had only two friends in highschool but after I changed school I never had any friends since.
910,As if high school love mattered. (I'm 22). I mean you can't seriously date in high school. I mean the way adult people do. That's what I believe at least.
911,"How did you know about the vaporwave lol. I still listen to Floral Shoppe to feel nostalgic about the romantic relationships I never had.

Feeling all of this except the 2 friends or none part. With me it's more like, friends who have next to nothing in common with you and the ones who would have something in common with you are males so they ignore your existence."
912,"Love the ""At Seventeen"" reference.

And the part about never knowing how high school love will feel like... I feel especially attacked at that lmao"

914,Where the hell are my magical powers?
915,magical spinsteress powers at 30 lol how old do you all think 30 is
916,Lfmaooo the pic is literally me
917,Hey im 18 and even i dont think 30 year olds are old lol
918,Wish I had her hair..
919,The thing I‚Äôve learned is that if you try hard enough on your appearance and do as much as you can people will at least notice that you put in effort.
920,Holy shit. Everything is true to a fucking t for me except i learned the truth at like 11 or 12.
921,The Prom Queen lyrics and the vapor wave are spot fucking on

925,"""you're still young..."" no mom, when you have to put 'still' before 'young' it mean i'm actually not  young..."
926,Yeah I had to move after my first year of middle school.  I went from having friends to being an outcast.
927,High school love doesn‚Äôt matter in the long run but it‚Äôs a learning experience. And a confidence booster that‚Äôs valuable at that age. It‚Äôs practice for the relationships you should have as an adult. To even know that I was lovable in my new ‚Äúadult‚Äù body would have meant so much to me. But I never got that. Never got the adult relationships either though (I‚Äôm in my 30s) so I guess it all worked out.
928,Thanks lol üíï did you get the beach bunny ref too?
929,"The closest movie like that I can think of is Secret Cutting on Lifetime. It's on youtube for free. I found it very relatable. She had very little interest from guys, she didnt have a glow up either. She had a friend who was mean to her."
930,"Thank you for these words. They resonate with me. :) 
Ps I love Hannah Gadsby."
931,"I was referencing the wizard meme that apparently male virgins turn into wizards at age 40. I made it 30 because thats apparently when we hit the wall and become undatable. The wall is fake, and we‚Äôre femcels, but I thought it would be a funny reference."
932,Literally every one of my relatives in a relationship is in a happy one and the few single female ones are miserable wrecks. I remember one older spinster relative who was literally always either angry or miserable. Thank god my generation has better pills.
933,I definitely caught that one too!
934,I first heard about that song from the ED memes subreddit and I love it x
935,omg this never leaves me. I hate it
936,"Good meme and this is a bit off topic but, that has got to be the grubbiest pikachu costume I have ever seen... wtf"
937,It looks like that wasted grey color stuffed animals gradually become after your dog uses it as a chew toy.
938,Ouch. I wish there was a way to temper somehow with your libido and the desire for intimacy.
939,Too real
940,Why you gotta out me like that?
941,I get angry at myself to even think about kissing someone. I feel like I don't deserve it at all... I'm too grotesque.
942,"oof. right in the feels.

i can't even fantasise without imagining myself with a different body."
943,yep
944,"I have a sad story.
I have a fuck buddy that I see whenever he wants, probably when he has no other options (we have seen each other like this about three times and I‚Äôve known him for 4 years). When he comes over he‚Äôs always drunk. We always have the lights off and kissing is out of the question (although he kisses random **pretty** girls at clubs no problem).
At least when we met he was sober."
945,[deleted]
946,"I know :(
I‚Äôm 30 so I did want to have sex and he was the only option. The worst part is that I feel I should feel lucky he even came to see me due my age and height (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 with a broad frame so i can look manly af)"
947,"God, same. I'm so glad to be out of that hellhole lmao"
948,same in college lol
949,"\*how your crush treated you like trash just to make you feel ashamed that something as ugly as you has feelings and thinks you could have a relationship or a ghost of a chance.

There, fixed it."
950,"Honestly change ""test you failed"" to "" work presentation you bombed "" and its still v applicable post-school"
951,Me right now in college except for the last oneüò≠
952,Same bruh
953,Your mistake was making it known....
954,"Nah, that would've resulted in instead death from bullying, I wasn't really the coolest.

I had a friend who did this and she was bullied real bad. I saw it even then realistically.

He was neither loved but ofc he thought he didn't deserve any less than a stacy and when he

realised that I am working on my looks and have a problem and wanted to be friends

he was a salty bitch and that other stuff that happened afterwards... well, guess he found a

way to feel better about himself on my costs. I became anorexic after this.

You know, people could still have the decency to just say ""that's a no for me"" instead of acting like I invaded their precious space."
955,my favorite thing is the typing fingers. love this.
956,"All credit goes to u/blue_skies11 for coining the term ‚Äú Toasted Sandwich Stacy‚Äù. There are a lot of words in this so, sorry if it‚Äôs hard to read lol.

Edit: forgot the ‚Äúe‚Äù after breath . I always try to spell check these things ! Dang it!!!!!! "
957,[Based on a true mentally toasted incel story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/a5gz8w/a_girl_was_really_nice_to_me_today/)
958,"YES OMG!! This is legit how men feel. They get offended by us ugly women when we talk to them. It's like wow, I'm sorry I'm not a cute girl!!!!1!!! Im sorry my existence bothers you that much!!!1! üò≠"
959,Always looking forward to these and this did not disappoint! I really like your drawing style
960,Love it this tea's still hot
961,"üò≠ you didn't!!! 

This is too cute and too accurate. I hadn't even read that thread until now. I love that you captured this highly relatable pink pill. Toasted Sandwich Stacy is here to stay!  

In b4 the screenshots"
962,Lmfao!!!!!!!!
963,LOL it was based off the post from r/ForeverAlone haha i love this
964,Don't bring Half-Life into this!
965,Lmao I wanted a comic like this when I saw the post on the FA subreddit. God bless your art üëåüëåüëå
966,[deleted]
967,"Lmao, this is my favorite one so far. Laughfuel. I really love this art, all the details and colors are brilliant. "
968,I sincerely love this.
969,"you're too funny. keep it up, love ur art"
970,"There is one inaccuracy here.  The guy probably doesn't change his shirt once a week, let alone throughout the day."
971,love it
972,Lol I hope I‚Äôm not the cashier on the right...

974,You can‚Äôt get anything toasted at Burger King for fuck‚Äôs sake.
975,Some of the comments are pretty funny XD on that post
976,His other posts are waaaaay worse. Writing about how he has a right to be superficial in judging women when he considers himself unattractive. He's ugly but he's superior to ugly girls. More entitlement. 
977,Oh god it‚Äôs real. If I said I don‚Äôt want it toasted then don‚Äôt toast it. Fuck. 
978,"I know I‚Äôm probably going to get some snarky responses, but what is a femcel, incel "
979,Thank you! 
980,Thank you! I am glad you like it!
981,"I always think of the movie Penelope and how nice it would be to have someone fall in love with me as a person before they see my face. Oh, the copes."
982,Lol that's guys after they see me without a weave
983,Most of the guys my age are repulsed by my face even when I have makeup on
984,"Omg u managed to make me laugh at 6 am when im sobbing over my pathetic life
Thank u"
985,"Unrelated. I really love those gifs of Horseheads with actual horses. Fuck, I wish *I* had a horse to spook with my face."
986,Same. And then I'm reminded I need to stop running my mind with similar fictional tropes
987,Yep. Even the simplest non supercial love story leaves me in ruins
988,As an ugly girl growing up I was obsessed with the love story of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning for this reason.
989,"Wait what? Guys don't like african hair? Tbh most girls I know love afro hair. I know I couldn't really mind less on hair.
Tbh hair is just hair. It's a shame there's so much pressure on it."
990,"Yeah - *girls*. Women often have empathy about that shit and find the real thing and it's texture/difference interesting. And to be fair....shared complex, right? Shared torment. 

Lots of men are too fucking stupid to even consider real natural hair as nice in it's own way, and have no concept of what it is having to have a weave sewn in"
991,"Yeah I absolutely agree with you. Natural hair is beautiful, all and every kind. 
Funny how they say women are the superficial ones, yet men base everything on what they see."
992,Gosh I love black twitter
993,"Black ppl always playing dumb trying to lowkey indirectly roast for no reason, no context at all that's why we always killin each other"

996,"i dont understand how/why black people are always the strawmam for the one race that are always killing each other, like other races dont have intraracial violence? dont mean to turn this into a big political thing but i always hated that stereotype"
997,"Idk man, I think it‚Äôs more  of a socioeconomic context rather than race. I feel ‚Äúbroke black people from the ghetto often killing each other‚Äù would be more fitting, although it still is a broad generalisation, but provides more context."
998,??
999,"Right, all races must hate each other. It turns out you're more likely to be killed by the people you live around, most people on this planet live around people of the same race. Crazy how that works. "
1000,"i didnt say other races don't kill each other, i said black ppl always killing each other, it ain't a stereotype"
1001,"And thats also not exclusive to black people, either. poor white people kill poor whites, poor latinos kill poor latinos, etc, except it seems the spotlight is solely on black people, probably to justify the police brutality and how it disproportionately affects black people. citing black on black crime definitely makes (racist) people feel better about black people dying at the hands of a cop because it sort of deflects the problem and redirects the discussion to why black people kill each other instead of why a cop is utilizing his authority in harmful and fatal ways and why its directed towards black people. 

the ‚Äúblack on black‚Äù myth seems to be so prevalent, it‚Äôs pervading even regular conversations (this post had nothing to do with killing, crime, etc and yet the trope was still mentioned) "
1002,I apologize. I meant no disrespect. 
1003,"black people do kill each other but i think the way you phrased it highlighted it as an abnormal and rampant problem. the reason why i brought up other races was to show that it isn‚Äôt exclusive to black people, or that there‚Äôs some hidden reason why black ppl kill each other, when intraracial violence is common and is due to people‚Äôs proximity to each other and like a poster said below, socioeconomic levels.

anyways this discussion /is/ sort of irrelevant to femceldom  anyways lol "
1004,"Ohhh honey we are definitely friends now üôåüèΩ

I hate how she phrased that. Reddit is always quick to bring up that dumb ass statistic."
1005,I was saying black people in this case because the person that tweeted that seems black.
1006,"What are you talking about, black on black crime ain't a myth, why do you think Chicago is called Chiraq? This is a legitimate issue, we are our own worst enemies."
1007,I‚Äôm just confused about your comment. It wasn‚Äôt disrespectful just‚Ä¶random as hell
1008,"it was phrased abnormal because it wasn't a serious comment 

...... 9 people getting it"
1009,oh yeah ur right
1010,"BoB isn‚Äôt necessarily a MYTH but it doesn‚Äôt really tell the full story. The concept, imo, is a myth. BoB sort of frames it as something that is exclusive to black people. white on white crime isnt a prevalent term thats used, or asian on asian, or latino on latino. It‚Äôs a myth in a sense that when it is being cited (in arguments for ex) they are not really telling a full story. "
1011,"I'm drunk, my dog died last night and I hit random and randomly said Bob Costas. "
1012,"I get that referring to black on black crime in a discussion about police brutality is inappropriate, but referring to that as a myth still makes no sense to me.

Edit:
From what I've seen in the media, people seem to mention it more as a response to the organization BLM"
1013,":(

My dog died mid last year and I'm not over it. I'm so sorry ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ "
1014,My condolences ‚ù§Ô∏è
1015,"Black on black crime is a myth in the sense that it's literally just crime. Black people aren't intentionally targeting other black people, they're just targeting people in their proximity. Calling it black on black crime implies that the race matters and has bearing on the crime. It doesn't. "
1016,I wish you the best 
1017,"I can relate. I can‚Äôt remember the amount of times I‚Äôve had dreams where I‚Äôm dating someone, and the worst part is that sometimes when I‚Äôm about to kiss the guy in my dream I just wake up... like wtf I can‚Äôt even fully enjoy my own dreams."
1018,Right in the feels. ;w;
1019,"at this point i'm just making myself sad ;n;

edit: the drawing isn't me, its a character.

edit2: thanks for the silver!"
1020,I have an imaginary boyfriend who I just think of sometimes. It helps me cope with loneliness.

1022,isn't that r/MaladaptiveDreaming?
1023,"Where do you get this magic lucid dreaming ASMR. I've once lucid dreamed in my life for about a few seconds but I couldn't stop myself from waking up, though I used some method of making it last longer I found online. I think it was spinning around? It was still awesome though."
1024,"Is this a specific video? Because if so, link please üò≥?"
1025,Just a heads up this has been cross posted to the sub r/shortcels

1027,can't relate.
1028,:')
1029,tfw the adrenaline rush wakes you up
1030,I wish I could give you a heart emoji. I do this to myself too.
1031,same. it just makes me even more sad though.
1032,nah it's lucid dreaming- like where you get to control your own dreams while you're sleeping. although it also applies to MDD lol
1033,"Yeah that's a grounding technique. 

Plenty of others exist tho. And you can make up your own. 

Also plenty of ways you can get them more often. But it all comes down to journalling yoir dreams. Questioning day to day life if it's  a dream. And then some have you ALSO wake up after 6 hours of sleep and go back to sleep. Sometimes in a specific way, to increase chances."
1034,lmao they're so funny.
1035,I think it‚Äôs more so about your brain not having any information of such experiences so it crashes like lost internet connection.
1036,"I find it ironic how they are mocking us and saying how we want chad and getting all hissy over it, when they are literally posting hot girls on that sub and talking about what they like to do to her and want to rope because they cant have her and how having a girl like that would fix their depression, yet us  dreaming about guys we find attractive, we get attacked, hypocrites much?? lol"
1037,"you're right, I don't know what's worse though :("
