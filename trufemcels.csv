I've had stacy-lite woman come here give her  all high mighty opinion in a passive aggressive way,after she saw that her trying to force her opinion on us wasn't working she called me a ''ugly pathetic bitch''"
9,mandoa_sky,"i hate moids like that. you know they're going to do a whole 180 as soon as you seem ""less attractive"""

11,wlogenerality,Wish I could upvote this twice. (And also upvote the original post twice.)
12,AshamedThrew,What is your definition of respect?
13,gigababejfl,Too bad no one saw your comment and now you're banned.
14,gigababejfl,Are you aware that not one comment of yours has been published on this sub and that you just got banned bc this is a sub for women only?  Keep your unsolicited opinions in your jock strap.
15,LetMeBeYouLittleShit,Lol I’ll do a sneaky edit.
16,SpinachIsYummy,I'm sorry you had to deal with that. People who come here should understand that this is a place for femcels and put femcels first and respect they're wishes.
17,kikii07,"''ugly pathetic bitch''

This is a word they like to use when loosing an argument because they have no substantial points at all. Using the ""word"" ugly as an offense to someone speaks numbers about that person. The number of brain cells they need because they are clearly that stupid"
18,SpinachIsYummy,Honestly the thing that reassures me is that he will be fucking himself because this guy is obsessed with Latina girls but he's also a Trump supporter so they don't want him. Then he whines about liberals being intolerant and how it's shallow and discrimination to not want to date Trump supporters. JFL how can somebody be this clueless and stupid.
19,Bravelady16,"Because social hierarchy being an ugly woman is like being a short man

You can't just point at a man and say he's poor and or has weak wrists. That's just more of a way to break into laughter for all sides. Same way you can't really tell a woman her pussy smells though that's also something beyond her control.

So ugly is the only leverage they have to remind you your standing."
20,RuthlessGirl,The irony...

22,scrunch33se,"I just want to give some more info, so don't mind me lol

Here's a video of the girl (Yang Peiyi) who was actually singing one year later: https://youtu.be/Lc4CCw9l8ok

Brief translation: Peiyi was finally on stage one year after the Olympics and she made her first record. Contrary to expectations, she didn't want the record to sell well because she didn't want to become a star. She also wished Ling Miaoke (lip synching girl) well and they're actually friends. Even though she likes Miaoke, she didn't like the director. She said he looked to strict and ugly lol. He wouldn't talk to her and he would just pat her head and mess up her hair. After the Olympics, Miaoke was starred in various commercials, movies, and dramas. Finally after one year, Peiyi came out with an album and became a star in her own right.

Btw I actually think Peiyi is super cute and props to her for being such a strong little girl."

26,JameelaPhan,"Imagine going through life knowing your country’s Olympics thought you were too ugly to represent them. I hope she has good people around her. This is, very sad."
27,molonu,"When I saw this photo, I was confused because both girls are equally cute; then, I read an article someone posted and it said the original girl had crooked teeth (like all kids do), and that wasn’t a good “image” for China so they needed another little girl. How fucking shallow.... kids are supposed to have jenky teeth."
28,kikii07,"It's ironic how I find this post while reading ""Beauty Pays"" by David Hammermesh and I saw this incidence in the book. This is what they always do, replace unattractive people and have attractive people lip syncing"

34,greensilvermoss,"That's exactly what it is, at least in western media.

* Movies aimed at men: ordinary guy gets hot girl

* Movies aimed at women: hot girl learns that hot guys are douchebags and starts dating uglier guy

That's always the plot."
35,Platero719,So true
36,dietmountndewbaby,Tryna look pretty for a nerd who is only nice 1% of the time rn.
37,CREEPYFUCKBOI,i still want to be prettier by starving myself and working out a bunch & learning to do feminine normie stacy becky make up so i can be lovable to some simp cuck dorky guy even tho on the inside i secretly want to be a boy...
38,curricel,Women will always be attacked on the basis of their physical appearance and thassa fact- if you’re hot you’re a dumb whore who is “too pretty for STEM” if you’re ugly you will be shamed for it even if your career has literally nothing to do with looks

43,greensilvermoss,"Propaganda means writers put those stories to the screen and it affects the way society feels - men grow up entitled, women grow up with low standards."
44,Shaakie,"Even if it's 'only' movies as you say, why the double standard on those situations? Don't tell me you don't believe that's not propaganda... Of course it ain't real life! But they are trying to change reality to their convenience."
45,curricel,Movies are a cultural and social influence
46,slap_dash,"Usually movies are relatable to the specific region so people will watch them. Even though movies are made all over the world, most movies that are shown and promoted in the western world are western... and even then.. its region specific. Unless the movie is amazing, it usually stays within it's own community. That being said, the reason the writers wrote the script that way is because its RELATABLE. This is the truth. So many damn movies and kid shows where the nerd girl gets an extreme makeover to get the hot guy while the nerd typically just has to put himself in a position to get noticed. There may be a slight makeover but very rarely is it ever the same extent that women go through."
47,,The proof is in the [pudding](https://www.bustle.com/articles/27995-my-tinder-dating-experiment-how-men-reacted-to-3-different-levels-of-makeup). Men have varying levels of respect for you based on your make-up.
48,,When men say they prefer natural beauty... what they really mean is makeup without dramatic eyes and blush
49,kwallio,People have been using pigment to change their appearance since the time of the Egyptians. No one is going to stop doing this. I experience radically different treatment when I wear makeup than when I don't. Usually I wear minimal/natural makeup because I feel like I look foolish in more dramatic makeup looks.
50,greensilvermoss,Men don't care to differentiate between real or fake. They'd much rather have fake interest from a woman they pay and fake beauty with loads of foundation and eye makeup.
51,Icy_Tradition,That's a damn shame... SMH!
52,Dahliacid,I just want my face to not look like the back of a chocolate chip cookie lmao

57,DeseretRain,"Though she got just as many matches with no makeup as she did with ""natural"" makeup, and actually got less matches with heavy makeup. And the guys were the most respectful and sent the least sexually harassing messages when she had no makeup...so wouldn't this indicate no makeup at all is the optimal strategy?"
58,greenteaapplepie69,Damn
59,,[deleted]
60,AshamedThrew,But makeup isn’t natural. Men are socially conditioned to think that faces full of makeup are actually normal for women. They see women in tv and online fully made up and start to expect that as a base standard for women. Which causes them to change their standards and believe women with makeup are “natural”. Or did you mean something different with this comment?

I have been spat on by a male before and males always spit on the street when they catch my eye - it's an Estonian male thing, to show a woman she is undesired - so it would be so fucking great to get to be the one doing it."
75,,[deleted]
76,spinsterbarbie,"Thanks. I doubt I'll get anything I want here in eastern aka shithole europe but hopefully I can find a way to get out of here by some miracle. The hard thing is to try and figure out all the ways males can take credit for my work or just plain not pay me. Males either want to screw you or screw you over and despite what most women think, the last option is way harder to live with. Congrats on ascending, don't fall back down, it fucking sucks here."
77,starshipminestrone,"this reminds me of that friends episode where they're having a disagreement about money, ross says idk i've never thought of money as a big deal and rachel says that's because you have it. beautiful people don't understand how much beauty matters because they have it, they've never known what it's like to be without it. i'll give the person in the video the benefit of the doubt that this is one of those gotcha titles but in general i'm tired of stacies telling me the grass isn't greener when we all know that's a bold faced lie."
78,learn2earn89,"This reminds me, if any of you guys listen to podcasts, there’s a recent podcast on Oprah’s Super Soul conversations talking about beauty called “Aging Well with Cybill Shepherd..” talking about Stacies and how many deny that their looks open doors for them. It was really interesting."

80,ThroawayGarbage,"Stacies, or even worse gigastacies talking about how looks don't matter and to just be confident is the equivalent of a millionaire preaching to hobos that money doesn't matter."
81,Throwawaygal0293ru0,"RANT INCOMING:

OMFG, just *stop*. If I hear one more pretty bitch whine about how their lives aren't perfect because they're attractive, I might just explode in a shriek of rage. No one's saying that ""look's are everything"" but they sure as shit make life easier. This woman will never truly understand what it's like to be treated as if she's a blight on humanity until she's well into her greys and wrinkles and has had a lifetime of privilege and comfort. No one fucking cares, besides maybe fellow hot chicks who want their thoughts validated on a public forum for the world to see.

I'm not saying I have absolute 0% of sympathy for her but it's definitely below the 50% threshold. *Oh, I have a job because of my well-formed genetics, pity me because my life isn't* ***completely*** *perfect.* Eat my ass after a sloppy shit. Talk to me when you're homeless and have people harassing you every day for absolutely no reason other than **fucking existing** near them."
82,,"Oh, joy. Another episode of ""Hey, how about I apologize for and act like something that can destroy and control someone's life isn't that big of a deal?""

This is a performance and a diversion--self-soothing means to feel just and good, to relieve themselves of responsibility. The difference between being seen as human and less then to a lazy passing eye and soul, between love and (probably) not, split impressions are the majority of what a person feels about another and breaking out of that frame is incredibly difficult. It's not everything. I never would argue that. But...that's not the problem here.

We have countless stories of this shit and it's twisted--beautiful people conveying ""beauty isn't everything uwu."" If anything it actually teaches the opposite. Pretty people showing proof of how much better they're treated...by being the only ones ""worth"" being shown to the world; a sort of satirical puppet show about the ugly skeletons in the closet.

Saying that you have insecurity problems too as a Stacy doesn't mean much and that girl goes about modeling being awful on a resume or something when her beauty would give her infinitely more flexibility in most walks in life than a deformed woman blessed by God with a Phd who has saved lives.

I won't spite her for rosy goggling but this stuff should really be replaced by people that understand how sneaky and insidious looks prejudice really can be, and help people avoid it. It can poison families, friendships, relationships, and...just existing besides other people. And it isn't just bullies or ""shallow"" people doing it either."
83,khmln,I saw this I hate it when attractive people say stuff like that!!
84,spinsterbarbie,"People like this are a huge fucking problem. Males validate everything they say which is ironic since they're only validating them because they look good. I'd love for her to be re-interviewed when she's all old and wrinkled up and talk about how much happier she is being ignored by everyone and having zero opportunities or future because noone wants to fuck her. But of course that's always just blamed on being old, although the real reason is the unfuckability to males, not wrinkles and gray hair in and of themselves. Males get those as well and old males rule society, just look at every government and corporate leadership."
85,,Now I’m going to need her to remake this video but her switching places. With an unattractive woman. Totally would be credible 👌🏾.

88,popcorn_popcorn,"[Link to the video](https://youtu.be/ks1FEtWlzTU)

The video title is misleading. She's very aware that her looks have opened doors that wouldn't have been opened otherwise. She doesn't talk about how you ""just need to be confident."" She does say however that just because your hot doesn't guarantee you'll be happy or secure."
89,curricel,"Have you guys actually listened to the ted talk though? She talks about how her status as a pretty white woman has benefited her. She doesn’t mean that looks “don’t matter”, just that they shouldn’t but she is aware of how they have actually privileged her throughout her life"
90,gbstril,I remember enjoying that ted talk but I can’t remember why. I do vaguely remember that she had a few good points.
91,popcorn_popcorn,"It is a bit of a gotcha title. In the video, she is very honest about how she knows she's a model because she won the genetic lottery. She knows that her looks have offered her opportunities in life that aren't offered to everyone."

93,greenteaapplepie69,this.
94,popcorn_popcorn,I don't know who had that idea. She explicitly talks about pretty privilege and it's not really a feel-good video.
95,spinsterbarbie,"Even if she knows that she's gotten unfair opportunities, she couldn't possibly realize the extent in which looks have put her ahead in any situation that has males involved in it, not to mention having zero clue about the horrors women go through for no other reason but their bone structure. So, clueless. Blind leading the blind."

99,popcorn_popcorn,"I mean, yeah. She's aware as she could be for her situation but ofc she will never truly know."
100,spinsterbarbie,And yet she gets to go up on stage and talk about it as though she has some fucking life lesson to give to the rest of us when in reality it's the other way around.
101,popcorn_popcorn,"I think the lesson is that becoming beautiful won't magically solve inner struggles. It ABSOLUTELY opens doors and makes life easier, but if you hate yourself, being pretty isn't necessarily going to solve that."
102,spinsterbarbie,"Okay, well everyone has inner struggles and hates themselves sometimes. Rattling off some generic teen-angst BS about how ""pretty girls still have inNer dArkNess"" shouldn't excuse people from waving away other people's actual, real life struggles."
103,popcorn_popcorn,"I agree. People are always going to want to listen to the pretty girl, and even though she wants to express herself, doing so can end up harming others."

Dermarolling, swallowing hyaluronic acid pills, using a hyaluronic acid cream and serum, facial masks and highly hydrating creams from La Roche Posay etc. has so much to do with genetics and doesn't cost a dime or any effort!

It's pointless to try to push social acceptance of people who are not conventionally attractive by just expanding the definition of beautiful, or claiming that ""everyone is beautiful"". You will never make that definition wide enough for everyone. There are people who are not attractive, and that's okay. They still deserve respect, and THAT's what we should focus on, instead of giving people balloon egos, inflated but fragile."

187,aimbotcfg,"> Always liked this comic (aside from the fact that we're supposed to feel bad for the fedora guy)

The Fedora guy is obviously there in a prominent role, because it is possibly the most derided and looked down upon stereotype the internet has left, and this comic is clearly commenting on the fact that prejudiced and judging by looks is still very real.

There are multiple subs and forums pretty much dedicated to slagging off this weird fictional fedora guy that I have literally never seen (I was actually wondering the other day where it came from, are there even people who own Fedoras, never mind wear them? and are there enough to warrant there being a stereotype about it?).

The fact that you agree with this comic *except the Fedora guy* is the exact point the artist was trying to make, and the one that you missed.

If you want to claim that 'all looks are to be respected', then it needs to be all looks, not just 'all looks up until I'm included, because I also want to be able to talk shit about other people'.

At that point it starts being about wanting to be part of the 'in crowd' and not getting rid of the idea of there being an 'in crowd' and that everyone deserves respect."

209,chubbyhobbit,"I feel this too. And I have always felt this. And who else in my situation can help but to feel cursed and doomed? Life can pretty much be simplified down to surviving long enough to find and impress a mate, procreate, do enough that your offspring survive to do the same, and then die. So I understand your pain. To be undesirable to mates is devastating on a primal level. But here's the thing, in the process of that whole ""surviving long enough to find and impress a mate,"" humans have created a new and wonderfully strange kind of life where we live much longer and within a much cushier society than ever before. We just don't have the same kind of struggles of being eaten, starving to death, freezing, etc. We have time to think and to analyze those thoughts and our emotions, time to cook extravagant meals for others or eat them, to travel to see new sights, to read, to understand others, to try to understand god or the universe or whatever other name you might have for the unknown, and to even muse about our deaths. Life has become so much more than just being a mate to someone. It's so much more than achieving some pseudo immortality through having biological offspring. Life now affords us so much more. It's unfortunate that suffering is such an intrinsic part of life but it's also kind of beautiful and meaningful. Like what does it mean to be denied this part of life? Why are you, and you specifically, this exceptionally intelligent consciousness that walks in a socially rejected vessel? What are you supposed to do with it and why? Our struggles are fuel for creativity, as yours clearly is. There's no better muse or motivator than suffering because it makes us yearn for change. Suffering is the seed of all philosophy and innovation. And what better hand to have this suffering in than your hands that communicate so eloquently what you think and feel. From what I can see, you are far from worthless. You have so much value. There is so much potential in you to reach a far more delicious an enlightenment and a transcendent level of being than there is in the general population. Let yourself want it because you can have it. And you deserve it."

216,Raida2,"



> I completely get what men see when they look at women. 

I can't put into words how much I agree.






And every day in that state I pass beautiful well dressed men and women, wondering where they're headed, who they'll go home to, their friends, their jobs. Their lives. Their memories. I am a lost soul ready to jump into another body the way a suicide is to jump off a bridge- I can feel my skeleton jolting out of its frame.





I am haunted by countless crushes - bosses, friends, coworkers - that just...lived in another realm. The boss who was 10 years older than me, a COO easily pulling in 250k+ a year, who talked about his wife the way all wives probably hope their husbands do. Picturing what she looks like. All the bright, good-looking, happy, attractive employees in the companies where I worked, who were directors at my age, while I was a fucking shitty worthless temp, treated like garbage in every interview and career-related pursuit I've ever engaged. Every adult social engagement. I spend most of my time with strangers - that's my adult life. Not even regular coworkers, as if spending most of your time with people whose knowledge of your personal life can literally lead to you being unable to pay rent isn't horrible enough.

So many strangers I pass in my city every single day. I stop to turn and stare sometimes, desperate. When you're lonely and miserable and hate your own life - you're on fire, aren't you. You'd do anything to not be yourself. It's beyond curiosity or passing horniness. I am horribly self aware at those moments and feel myself leaving my body, my soul is that goddamned ready to GET OUT. To escape. To follow him.

...He sees Her. The perpetual ""her"" that has haunted me since I was a little girl and understood how important it is to be cute and pretty if you want to be loved, fantasized about the sort of easy friendship, admiration and affection so many women and men have - people who consider themselves average.

All these women that pass me every day, beautiful, and having lived as beautiful, wanted people - make me think about quietly hanging myself in my shower. I could get $100,000 worth of plastic surgery...and with my luck I'd continue to destroy my body and mutilate myself, inch by inch. Be fucking botched.

I curse God - for all of you. The really ugly among you who know what I'm talking about, and know this feeling I'm describing, where after a few years, you don't feel human. You're Cain, and ugliness in this horrible hyper-digital age, this cruel, glossily vapid age is the mark you live under, but you harmed no one.

And shit, ugly men too, who make me feel such horrible guilt. (Do men ever feel bad for ugly women, if they even see them? Does anyone anywhere - anyone but bullies and horrible brutalizing parents/family - see ugly women, friendless and unliked and doomed to lives without touch or love?)

I stand and look more closely at pretty girls than any man ever could and measure her beautiful extremities, all that smooth skin, the line of her back, her smile, her hair, her nose, her beautiful eyes - and each feature is like a counting of all the ugliness contained in my own fucking disgusting person. Fuck - I get it. I get what she does. I am in awe of her - I understand why they seem like dreams come into drab real life, to men. And it makes me hate myself so much, feel so fucking hopeless, I wonder what fucking deity I pissed off that I couldn't just be ""average"".

I have never met a woman that looked like me. Only men. In 30 years on earth I've only seen one woman - near tears, staring at the ceiling, overweight, unquestionably someone with PCOS - who had cystic acne like mine. Certainly not at college.

The hair on my nasty tits, the fucking nasty potbelly blooming repugnant under a narrow concave, strangled rib cage, the perpetual swayback thanks to the surgery.

...What would it be like just to put on a dress that shows your back or stomach or shoulders in August and not feel ashamed or like you might as well be flashing the world, your nasty fucking body is that obscene?

I realized something else too, or muse about it, in the dark - every man that's ever haunted me, who never did more than pity me....as I try to conjure how their bodies would feel under my hands from scant memories of what human skin and muscle even feels like, or try to imagine being held - I wonder if they would change the fact that there is nothing in life or in my mortal dreams that make life bearable. Those fantasies are no longer a comfort - they make me ill. They're unwitting deeply cruel self-mockery. When I come too, back into myself, look at myself - fuck of Christ, tears like glass shards well my eyes.

Why? Because for most people, if they want something - a partner, a job, to learn how to dance, a goal...most of the time, they get it. They accomplish it. They're worthy.

I've never been ""worthy"" of anything I wanted. Water, water everywhere...for everyone else. Femcels? Stranded in the bloody damn desert.

I think, even if being ugly and all the other things about myself that have led me to this horrible, friendless, miserable, sick life didn't matter, if people loved me enough to endure my weakness and reciprocated my feelings for them, if I had the things that tortured me with their total impossibility...would it change the fact that I cannot imagine loving anything in mortal life more than the thought of just fucking being dead already? Would I be less angry? Would it be worth the pain?

But that's the point - the point is being ugly and socialized as an ugly person - or maybe, like me, a fucking stupid person, or an awkward one, one with no talents, nothing of value professionally, no physical grace, nothing other people seem to come by so easy to bring oneself pleasure and to endear oneself to others - all of it deprives you of things you cannot reason away. Romantic love; sex; companionship. Material and psychological comfort. Peace of mind. Unapologetic freedom of expression and movement in your own body. Self-respect. Self-worth.

Hope."

I get the ""you're so bootyful you look so natural!"" shit when I'm wearing, in order: face wash, toner, at least 2 face masks, serum, some weird snail extract cream that's the fucking goat, primer, color corrector, foundation, concealer, powder, contour, liquid bronzer, powder bronzer, blush, more powder, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, brow pomade, and two setting sprays.

Like, as long as you're not wearing highlighter, dudes are literally dumb enough to think you just look like that. It doesn't even occur to them that you're not the naturally flawless barbie girl of their dreams as long as their dick likes it.

EDIT just to be safe, I don't get the random compliments if I'm not wearing makeup, so it's not like I'm actually flawlessly model-like beautiful. I'm pretty splotchy normally and I get weird acne texture along my cheekbones."

Every time I see this I am happy that she clapped back at him and that people laughed at him but, I am sad and sickened that he did this and moreover that it got back to her to where she did clap back at him. You see... in order to answer him back, she had to see that from some stranger she never did anything to and didn't ask for this at all from took this nasty shot at her just for the way that she looks.

Well, imo, this pic is proof that you are definitely not a femcel. Even without makeup and with a bad angle here you are at least a low tier normie and with some concealer, mascara, lipstick and cute hairstyle you would be at least a regular normie. 

And I am not saying this to be nice. I have seen other posts here and those women were indeed femcels and I never tried to tell them otherwise or invalidate their experience. But girl, you are certainly not a femcel. Maybe not very attractive but still, if you just softmax a bit you will be average easily.

This is the reason I don’t treat “femcel” and “ugly girl/woman” as interchangeable terms, because your looks aren’t the problem here. You’re average, with a slight boost because you’re young, and like I say, your version of looks maxing is more Aloof Hipster Chick or Hot Nerd. 

Also, like other older femcels are saying below, you’re SO YOUNG. I feel legit empathy for you baby femcels but statistically a lot of you aren’t as far behind the bell curve as you feel you are, and statistically it is just too early for most of you to be writing off the possibility of love and sex lives. If you’re past 30 and still “never been kissed”, loved, or had sex that wasn’t an extremely bad decision? Then we can talk. <3"

Now this doesn’t however not make you femcel, maybe more volcel or even mentalcel, I would say a healthy dose of cynicism and not letting anyone convince you to wear makeup to play pretend stacy will do you wonders in the long run.

If you were IRL Phoebe your skin would be darker and splotchy, your nose would be upturned, large, and flat, and your eyes would either be too small or spaced too far apart. I personally don’t want to put down women for their looks but there are plenty of examples of actually ugly woman."

She also calls herself fat in a later comment, which 1) is changeable and 2) is not that bad if the pic is any indicator. looking down without a double chin and non-chubby hands has me thinking this is just a normal young woman beaten into self-hatred thru a combination of introversion and instagram reality poisoning self-perceptions."

411,entrylevelheaux,this is a moid
412,,She's not fat at all; she's a normal healthy size for her age.
413,uniqueeleni,"As someone who has seen both sides of the coin (I used to be average, then a Stacey, then a fatcel and now I am a Becky trying to lose some last weight and groom myself better in order to be a Stacey again), please try to hear me out.

You just admitted that you can look average with makeup, which is undoubtedly true. Average is way different than being a femcel. Being a femcel defines you to an extent. That’s not to say that 4-5/10 women do not experience the effects of lookism of course. And yes, that’s the attention most average looking women get: a few glances here and there and approaches every now and then by creepy/old men. 

What I am trying to say is that at your level of attractiveness it should be easy for you to not let your appearance define who you are as a person. But you are choosing to let it. I know you have suffered from lookism too, I know your life would be better, more effortless if you were more attractive and that’s why you probably identify in this community but dealing those feelings the way you seem to be, is not healthy for you or your self esteem.

It seems like you are blaming things on your looks that are not your looks’ fault. That won’t help you grow and be a happier, better version of yourself. Take a look at r/trunormies, maybe you’ll identify with that sub a little more."
414,GailaMonster,"Here's some truth:

You sound like a volcel- not just because you could lose weight if you really think that's the problem (given your pic i don't, you have a cute face and it's obvious you're not THAT overweight given your hands and neck), but because you sound like you're not trying despite being unhappy with your circumstances. I know you tried in terms of giving that guy your number (good job! and he texted! he wouldn't have if you were a no for him, that's objective proof you're considerable for him), i meant tried to address the things about yourself you feel make you a femcel. What is your glow up plan?

How old are you? I want to be supportive of people feeling unloved/unloveable at any age, but honestly, it's hard for people under a certain age to be so certain they are undesirable when they haven't had a chance to explore the world or meet many people from outside their school bubble. 

Lose some weight, work on being more comfortable existing in public, ask yourself what about your behavior is making folks say you act like a zombie, and come back if you hit your mid-30's having addressed all of that and still never having had a boyfriend. 

You're cute. maybe make some videos of yourself and analyze them for how you might be coming off as a ""zombie"" or ""weirdo"". Doing this for myself helped me realize how shit my posture is if i'm not paying attention, and how much that makes a difference between me looking normal vs looking like i'm a mentally impaired troll woman."
415,,"I know it sounds like a terrible cliche but smiling can help a lot as regards getting people to be less judgemental.

When you mix with people you have to try and empty your mind of negative thoughts - almost like giving yourself a frontal lobotomy and pretending you think all's well with the world and you have nothing but happy happy thoughts in your head.  You put on a sort of half smile to make yourself seem like you're confident and  at ease with your surroundings and want to fit in despite how you might really feel inside.  This does actually convey the very opposite of how I feel toward society but I have found that people are less likely to pick on me if I do it.  Try it anyway as if you convey an angry or sulky and unhappy look people will tend to dislike you and bullies will target you.

You're definitely not fat either.

You have a good facial structure - far more normal looking than mine and you seem generally pretty normal so you should make the most of your advantages.  I can guarantee that if you are seen smiling and laughing by others when out and about some people will take a liking to you.

Post another photo of yourself with makeup on and smiling/laughing - show your teeth -  I bet you will look really pretty."
416,burnerPhone411,"Your nose has a pretty shape. Just accept the compliments, gosh."
417,,You'd love your nose if you had mine!  Appreciate what you have - it's a very normal looking nose - this is a major win!
418,,I don't use skin products at all - each morning and night I wash my face with warm water with a face flannel.  Often the skin products can cause spots if your skin is very sensitive.  As long as you get the oil off your skin and make sure you rub areas like round the nose and chin with warm water so the pores are kept clear your skin will be ok.  When you wear makeup you need to take more time to remove every trace with flannel and warm water too.
419,smellys0cks,"sorry, but no. she could be average at most."
420,smellys0cks,are you implying that only men can be rational?
421,Caranda23,I think you're being pessimistic but even if you're right average is not femcel/ugly.
422,smellys0cks,"""at most"" means if she tried her hardest to look good. i asked multiple people who aren't aware of these types of communities to rate her and they all gave her a 2/10. it's funny that i'm being downvoted to oblivion when most regular people would agree with me."
423,BoJack_Jewess,"You're actually claiming that a bunch of perfectly normal people rated a young girl with no actual deformities, a full head of hair, and very mild skin imperfections as a 2/10. So then what does a 1 look like? What you're saying literally makes no sense."
424,uniqueeleni,"She is clearly trying to look ugly here. Her hair, expression, lack of makeup. She can fix all that in a day and be a normie which is completely different from being a femcel. I can take pictures looking almost as bad if I try too."
425,smellys0cks,"yes, they did. i don’t agree that she’s a 2. normies throw around ratings like that without taking truly ugly people into consideration when ranking people from 1-10, but the point is that she looks below average."

Men are more uniform in opinions and desires from women so when you have a group of men that you know wont date you and only want sex and you are lonely... the only way to choose between them is looks... and obviously going for the one most attractive is the reasonable thing to do.

Women are a lot more forgiving with traits in men. Sure, ugly men may have to work harder, but there is a chance.

For women, ugly girls can work as hard as they want, it usually doesnt matter. Men will always try to trade up."

506,Femcel2002,"I love that so much. I had that once; you have really beautiful eyes. Swiftly followed by ""you don't deserve them"" eg. I am so ugly that these pretty eyes are wasted when the rest of the package is rotten. Cheers for thatttt."
507,Victoria_Eremita,"Kierkegaard says that when you have a kind thought about someone, it belongs to them, and it is selfish and wrong to keep it from them, especially if it’s done out of pride or spite or fear or whatever. Those kind thoughts are rightfully theirs, and keeping it from them is akin to withholding anything else that is rightfully theirs. I believe that. I never keep compliments to myself, unless I think it will embarrass someone or make them uncomfortable."

Also 69th upvote kek"
509,dragonsky,"> I got the same compliment once in middle school. A teacher gave it to me. 

Me and two other students were part of some..project or smth like that..

The teacher started to give us some orders about what we should do

Her to student 1 : You should dance. Don't be ashmed, you are really pretty boy and you will look great doing so

Her to student 2: You will do this and that, you are a beautiful girl and you will definitelly nail this!

Her to me: You....are.......going to talk, don't be afraid it will be ok

The others are pretty but me... :/"

WTH? I’ve noticed this recently! What’s up w/that, Reddit"
511,Rabb1tH3ad,I think they float the votes a little bit to discourage people from basing their votes on that number. If you refresh a thread a few times you'll see the numbers change. Doesn't really help though lol
512,noavocadoshere,"i never keep photos of myself for too long, even if i initially liked them. the more and more i look at them, i start hating my features up close and in general. i told myself i'd take more photos, and right now one of the few i do have is of a tattoo design i was thinking of."

And I relate to this a lot. I look different in different mirrors, pictures angles, lighting ect; it drove me crazy. Eventually I just decided to accept that I was ugly and stop looking. 

I used to take hundreds of selfies in different lighting just to figure out how I looked. I had to look at myself in the reflections of windows and in bathroom mirrors at different places. It really fucked me up."
515,Abasketoftrash,"I hated the camera for many years and would often dread having to be seen in photos I can’t change. Though I would always stick close to a mirror so I could look my best at every single moment. Going to class, skipping class, lunch break, bathroom break, & even in my home where I could spend hours upon hours analyzing myself. I still dislike taking photos now unless I edit to where I look presentable."

525,nicecherries,oh sorry i didn’t notice! but yeah this comic represents me. i feel like i never truly know how i look like. i can hope i look better but then i can also look way worse. i just wish i looked like those photogenic models

They have no real passion in life, no work to throw themselves into, they are too stupid to be true creators.


So now they try to feel better by shitting on other women, trying to convince themselves that they are not below average, it's just that women are dumdums in general! No, not all of us are losers. Just them :)

571,AlienUtterings,"Yes. We need to look at what IS good for us, not what SEEMS good in some moment. P0rn and pr0stitution are bad for women, even if some choose ro do it. Those choices come because the woman is in a bad place."
572,GailaMonster,"> If some woman wants to be a doormat, that is NOT okay.

Well, anyone is allowed to have a sub fetish, and enjoy same. 

Dominatrix is a job, some men like being subs, too.

The issue is when men see a woman who happens to have a sub fetish, and then say ""see? that womans' personal relationship preferences are how ALL WOMEN SHOULD ACT, for the pleasure of my cock!""

A further issue is when women have low self esteem and don't actually have a sub fetish, they just think they need to compensate for their apparent shortcomings by being subservient/subs, even tho they don't actually like it. That's people lying to themselves, and is just as bad as a gay person forcing interest in a straight relationship because ""at least i'm not lonely"". 

We really need to free ourselves of the notion that anything is better than nothing, when it comes to relationships."

601,vcardthrow1,"Clearly you, as a woman and the party being affected by this, are wrong. You're too close to it! 

Why didn't you just come to the correct conclusion that women that don't like being choked and spanked and being ass-fucked with a wine bottle by a guy who can't be bothered to wipe his own butthole (while you yourself must be as hot as Sasha Grey or whatever ethnic fetish star dudes are spanking it to) are all frigid puritanical bitches?

(Cue pickme piping up she LOVES porn and laughing in agreement) 

I'm ok with kinks being normalized but the truth is, so long as good looking people practice it - this shit has been normalized since at least the 90s.

In the age of phony sex positivity, nobody realizes ""kink"" as an obligation - one women usually have to accept, acted upon by men - isn't actually sex positive. Nor is the ongoing shaming of adult virgins. 

I could rave about this for hours. Every Stacy and Chad goes ON AND ON about how they have anxiety and depression (none of it makes them kinder people, of course, or less judgmental!), they love getting karma points talking about the year in their life they wore braces....and yet it's never been more acceptable to celebrate prejudice against people for being conventionally unattractive or unphotogenic/feeling uncomfortable being photographed. People are stupid fucking narcissists who love shaming others like its a national pastime. Maybe it's always been that way but it's so strange to me how that goes on in the age of the tearful, shittily-written Personal Essay.

The normalizing of porn in culture and the impetus to be DTF and game makes looksism, adult virginity, and simply drawing boundaries so much worse."
602,starshipminestrone,i feel like the general principles of the pink pill are well agreed upon and resonate with a good number of women (especially women of color) which is why there are so many normies/beckies/stacies here. they just don't wrap it up in the cel speak like calling it the pink pill or using terms like stacy or femcel.
603,sassysenpai69,"i just saw this on twitter

the guys in the comments were throwing a tantrum lol"
604,heladosky,"True, you don’t know how many normies or ugly guys I’ve seen with stacies omgg, because imo women aren’t that into looks like men, we fall in love with things more deep beyond physical appearance, and men typically fall in love after they’ve liked your physical appearance. Also I’ve seen many times where the girl wears the cutest outfits has her hair done and nails too... and then the guy is wearing really normal or bad clothes, it’s ok to wear normal clothes but if your girl is always wearing nice clothes just try to look cute for her too."
605,,And broke and abusive and immature and unfaithful ...
606,greenteaapplepie69,"We need to decide what the Pinkpill really means.

608,DivaHustlerPrincess,"It’s true.

Men can be ugly because they have money, status, and (maybe)height to fall back on."
609,,Lol so true.
610,spinsterbarbie,"I really would like it if we forgot the whole ""pill"" thing and make up our own terminology. This is feminism, just not the mainstream pick-me type feminism where feminism just means that Stacy gets to have someone give her a job for her looks, not acknowledge it and everyone calls it empowerment. 

Stacies and upper tier beckies know what's up but they benefit from it. There is no pill to take for them. It's only unattractive women that are kept in the dark as to the advantages of being attractive and fed BS about confidence and other shit to keep the status quo going. This is done by other women.

So yeah, it resonates with everyone because everyone can see who males give what treatment to. Males don't hide it. But so long as Stacies are getting everything they want there will never be any mainstream backlash against lookism. Life is just way too good for women who are pretty."

614,Anatheballerina,"It’s nice having a job but you get huge amounts of imposter syndrome questioning whether you got the job because you’re competent or because someone thought you’re hot. 

I’m not trying to underplay the stuff less attractive women go through. It’s a much harder world out there if you’re not attractive as a woman."

616,spinsterbarbie,"It's VERY nice getting paid for doing nothing and praised by males on top of it. In fact it's probably as good as life gets for anyone in this world.

 I don't see what imposter syndrome has to do with being a Stacy, absolutely everybody goes through that and some of us don't get praised for anything we do while Stacy can spend the whole day on Insta and at the end of it do some half-assed little task and every male around is in awe. 

But boo-hoo Stacy is insecure so how about us peasants not say anything and suffer in silence so she doesn't throw a tantrum about how jealous older women are such meanies making her feel bad."
617,kikii07,">because you’re competent or because someone thought you’re hot. 

I heard so many women saying as long as they have the upper hand it's okay to just use their looks. The denial is real cause deep inside I don't think one has the thought of who doesn't benefit the way I do because they lack something out of their control."
618,jeanblack19,Thanks ❤
619,Anatheballerina,"No one who goes into a field to excel wants to be known because they’re attractive. I’d rather be seen as competent. I don’t want to get paid for doing nothing, I want to get paid because I’m good at something that doesn’t involve being some creepy, sexist guy’s arm candy. I don’t want praise, I just want to be seen as competent. No female in my workplace has ever belittled me or treated me poorly but men definitely think I’m not nearly as good as them at my job."
620,Anatheballerina,"I’ll be real- I used to be incredibly hairy and my mom would not let me shave whatsoever. I don’t mean like a bit of armhair- I mean dark hair on my cheeks... People actively bullied me. I got laser hair removal multiple times and while the hair is still there, it’s very sparse. I was lucky enough to have good facial features and work out regularly to maintain my body. I wasn’t always “Stacy” so I know what my looks have done for me."
621,spinsterbarbie,"Yeah ugly women are never thought of as incompetent because they're women /s 

Look, it's better to get paid and be viewed as a useless bimbo than get minimum wage and have to do said bimbo's job and get yelled at on top of that. If you don't agree, well, good luck to you on whatever planet you're living on."
622,kikii07,I am hairy as well with extremely bad facial features. Despite the hairy part you say you have great facial features. Stacy inherently has great facial features.
623,Under_the_bluemoon,"“Work out regularly to maintain my body.”

THIS is the sort of thing that looks-privileged women say because they actually believe that women with unattractive bodies aren’t engaged in just as much exercise (and food restriction) as they are. (There’s a reason that anorexia occurs most often in fat women.)

Faux-feminism is imagining that one lives differently, and better, than women who are considered unattractive."
624,Anatheballerina,"They didn’t matter when I was completely covered in thick, black hair."
625,Anatheballerina,Yea except I don’t believe that. Plenty of women in my family eat healthy and exercise but have issues with thyroid (something that’s possibly in my future as well.) I can honestly tell you that my life IS better and has become better since I got the laser hair removal. I don’t get pointed out and laughed at anymore. That’s just my personal experience.
626,kikii07,Same with me. I'm just saying that I wish I had a decent face. Having an ugly face and being hairy just makes me look like a human beast....it's not a great feeling cause I don't have any other qualities I can substitute.
627,Under_the_bluemoon,"Oh, I’m sure your life is better after the hair removal - mine is too (I had the same issue).

If you don’t believe that body appearance is a product of working out, then you’re more-knowledgable that most Stacies. But making statements like you did above promote the same myths. We don’t get to choose our body types/weights. Working out is great for your health, but that’s not what the statement implies."
628,Anatheballerina,"Looking back at it, it’s absolutely insensitive and I apologize! Clean diet and exercise definitely make you healthier but achieving the ideals set for women is only possible for some/few women."

I remember the wave of fake geek girl hunts before 2014, but after the events of 2014 it grew exponentially. Now gamers fight ""women and other minorities"" and ""feminazis"" who ruin their games, also leftist journalists, especially female journalists. It's often organized, sponsored by right-wing politicians, vicious. So the hate inside gaming is very real.

I used to have anxiety so bad I wouldn’t leave the house. But now I’m not afraid to show my face anymore. Sometimes I feel like I look exactly like that yafayette (is that her name? Piglet) girl from the Witcher...but I just learned to accept that I don’t have money for plastic surgery so I just have to get over it. Life is too short to not enjoy it because people are assholes."

651,cannibae,Realistic life goals right here.
652,,"I'm ugly and I'm proud. No really, this is great. I think I would be this if I could 

1) get an actual career instead of working a minimum wage part-time job

2) get my own apartment instead of living in such a terrible place.

2) get some treatment for depression and anxiety that is due to being so poor, having no friends, and growing up with a horribly abusive and downright evil father.

I mean, I already have library/movies/going out by myself down to a finesse. I have always known I am ugly since I was a little girl, and it's never really bothered me. I usually do wear what I want, and I have my own hobbies. 

And I love all of it. 

All I really want is in the list above, plus some friends every now and then! Never wanted a boyfriend, and probably never will."
653,orangeti,This is me. Already know I’m a femcel and living my life without societal rules.
654,Freshestboiintown,If you don't stop with these quality memes
655,M_Ad,"Heads up to the femcels in their 20s from a 36 year old big sister: do your best to start working towards this. Statistically you’ll experience at least one kind of romantic sexual relationship in your life, even if it doesn’t last, but in case you don’t, or it doesn’t last, this is a healthy long term femcel goal. Hang in there, you got this. <3"
656,polarbear_topaz,Do you know me personally? 😭
657,molonu,"👏🏼 Goals. I’m about 3/4ths way there. I don’t have a ton of money so I can’t dress how I’d like, but I’ve like 80% mentally chosen to be a confident “fugly” so that I can stop giving a fuck about what other people think. There’s so much more freedom to being imperfect, like you have more space to move around. That’s paraphrasing what ShittyRobots girl said about her work btw, but it’s true for looks too."
658,flowfem,"Honestly tho, I wish everyone that sort of life!"
659,manachronism,"The toxic friends part is kinda odd. I’ve noticed a lot of ugly girls are really narcissistic, me kinda included but I recognize when I’m pushing it. I had an acquaintance cut it off with me who fits this profile pretty much, because I had a different political opinion. A lot of relationships that shouldn’t have mattered so much to people are ended with the “I’m doing what’s best for me...” Making somebody listen to why you don’t like them for a half hour isn’t what’s best for both of you. Tell me to buzz off and just go do something for once in your miserable life. I feel like a lot of femcels feel like they are smarter than stacies, but boy they can be equally as needy and borderline retarded, if they never get their egos checked."

842,entrylevelheaux,This is such a weird comment. Not the fact that you don't find her unattractive. But the fact that you're like all she needs is a few cosmetic surgeries costing thousands of dollars and she'll be pretty. Such an odd thing to say about someone else. Especially when it's your opinion on her. Not her own opinion or wants. So YOU alone think those procedures will make her attain true beauty in YOUR eyes as if your eyes are the only ones that matter.

Thailand is such a beautiful country in every other way."

They're not minors but from my observations, these women are here without speaking the language and alone with these older men far away from family. This is so prevalent that I wonder if these men bought these women to their poor families or if there's a Russian bride type of business. Some of them look happy but others just seem miserable."
880,Arazivial,"So far I discovered two reasons for this (creepy white men with yellow fever)

They see Asian women as more subordinate and less stuck up

or anime "
881,AnniaT,"There's this stereotype that Asian women are not ""ruined"" by the female emancipation movement of the western countries. Many men will only go for Asian women because they see them as submissive, easy to manipulate and excellent house wives. Aside for some men's creepy Asian pedo fetiches, I think this is the main reason.

It's objectifying."

890,NibbleNomNom,Yes I’m aware of this. That’s why I said yellow fever was insulting. I’ve been dressing myself “gayer” in an attempt to break those stereotypes. And a lot of Asian women today hate to be associated with that kind of vocabulary too.
891,,Where do u live? Never heard that in my life but that’s fucking hilarious 
892,M_Ad,have you also heard the one about Asian women having two vaginas so they can fuck two guys at once and earn double the money (because all Asian woman are whores obvs) /Asian woman
893,,"Underage boys are literally human trafficked into Thailand and forced to “transition” which literally leaves them with mutilated bodies and infertile, so their handlers, the government, and businesses can make money off of them while they are getting raped. 

Idc people supporting transgenderism in the United States and other countries are promoting, encouraging, and supporting this behavior. It’s disgusting. And high key pedophilia considering they want boys as young as 5 years old to go on hormone blockers so they never go through puberty and can keep their little boy bodies forever. "
894,Arazivial,"When you call someone stuck up it means that person is arrogant and sees themselves superior those around them. 

It’s basically another way of saying calling someone a snob or snobbish.

946,liquid_lightning,High school love doesn’t matter in the long run but it’s a learning experience. And a confidence booster that’s valuable at that age. It’s practice for the relationships you should have as an adult. To even know that I was lovable in my new “adult” body would have meant so much to me. But I never got that. Never got the adult relationships either though (I’m in my 30s) so I guess it all worked out.

961,RareSorbet,"Right, all races must hate each other. It turns out you're more likely to be killed by the people you live around, most people on this planet live around people of the same race. Crazy how that works. "

963,daveachapella,"And thats also not exclusive to black people, either. poor white people kill poor whites, poor latinos kill poor latinos, etc, except it seems the spotlight is solely on black people, probably to justify the police brutality and how it disproportionately affects black people. citing black on black crime definitely makes (racist) people feel better about black people dying at the hands of a cop because it sort of deflects the problem and redirects the discussion to why black people kill each other instead of why a cop is utilizing his authority in harmful and fatal ways and why its directed towards black people. 

the “black on black” myth seems to be so prevalent, it’s pervading even regular conversations (this post had nothing to do with killing, crime, etc and yet the trope was still mentioned) "
964,,I apologize. I meant no disrespect. 
965,daveachapella,"black people do kill each other but i think the way you phrased it highlighted it as an abnormal and rampant problem. the reason why i brought up other races was to show that it isn’t exclusive to black people, or that there’s some hidden reason why black ppl kill each other, when intraracial violence is common and is due to people’s proximity to each other and like a poster said below, socioeconomic levels.

BoB sort of frames it as something that is exclusive to black people. white on white crime isnt a prevalent term thats used, or asian on asian, or latino on latino. It’s a myth in a sense that when it is being cited (in arguments for ex) they are not really telling a full story. "
