Edit: Thanks for my first silver, kind stranger!"
1,Well I have now been banned from men writing women because there was a meme of a 50's wife worshiping her husband by fixing dinner kneeling at his lap. Someone commented on how to be her and someone else responded to identify as as a woman. I responded be born a woman. Well that set a few TIMs brain on fire. I'm again a terf and according to the mods all trans who identify as female are female regardless. I was banned forever with the exception of reading and voting. So men writing women had TIMs more in mind than women with vaginas. Irony at its finest.
2,This.
3,"> You take away the biological definition of woman and all that's *left* is sexism. 

Absolutely this. It baffles me that more people don't see it."
4,"Thats what sits wrong with me about the entire thing.

If you want to wear a dress, wear a dress. You don't need to take hormones or avoid using urinals to."
5,So well said! Yes!
6,It's almost as if... he totally could have been a cross-dresser in the privacy of his own home and presented as fucking normal otherwise. Most people don't parade their fantasies out in the real world.
7,"Translation: I’m going to be myself at work because being a woman is something I can opt into our out of whenever it benefits me because I am a man. Ya know his version of being a woman is totally real and valid and not at all a costume he can take off whenever he wants to advance his career. 

Super embarrassing that he thinks being himself is cross dressing and living a double life. 

I can’t even being to dissect how painfully dumb this one is..... and he’s serious. Did his mother drink lead paint while pregnant? How do men get to this point?"
8,"Hmm, maybe I should try the reverse.  ""I am female, except I identify as trans in cases of salary negotiations."""
9,If only women could opt into privileges
10,"Gee, if only females could opt in and out of male privilege."
11,A TiM dreaming of having male privilege has to be the most ironically female thing I've ever read.
12,"""It's my dead name, that's why I use it every day for business!"""
13,Crossdressing back to male 😂
14,"you know that’s because he doesn’t have money for face feminization and won’t get a promotion looking like mario but dressed as peach, right?"
15,[removed]
16,">I get much more response rates

Something tells me that his juvenile communication skills might be affecting his sales a bit more than just his fake name. Imagine how great he'd be doing if he could write like an adult under his birth name!"

18,Yeah people need to put their fetishes back in the closet.
19,I hate seeing people’s fetishes at work
20,Yep. /r/itsafetish.
21,"THIS is why I think half the TIMs (the non-sexual predator/fetishist ones) transition.

Getting the best of both worlds is cheating, just like the big husky men who compete in women's sports."
22,Took the words right out of my mouth.
23,Tag yourself I’m “guy for business”
24,#🤢
25,What does dressing as your sex mean. You realize you’re on a gender critical sub right?
26,"Jealous of male privilege and how women are treated like second class citizens? That's putting it mildly. 

Jealous that some male LARPer thinks he had the best of both worlds? LMAAOOOOOOO"
27,do you?
28,"Um, yes? Again, what does «dressing like your sex» mean?"

31,"Lol. You're delusional. Love that you're trying to report a very upvoted comment from a month ago.

And I'm an ""alt right homophobe"" for saying that a man doing the equivalent of blackface but for women is probably not a good look?  ....that's quite a stretch."
32,"A hate group. promoting and inciting violence...

\[but they're trans so it's ok...)"
33,And this is the exact reason why I carry.
34,I'm staring to believe in the transcel theory.
35,"Gotta love it when violence, threats, doxxing, etc from TIMs is totally a-okay, but highlighting the unrealistic ideas these individuals have about a very invasive surgery isn’t. Not surprised since both Reddit and TIMs hate women. They can live in their delusion though."
36,Why are they obsessed with TERFs? TERFs don't kill them. TERFs don't add to their death toll. Why don't they give this medicine to men who kill them?
37,Report them. They likely won't do anything about it but we should start collecting violent screeds like this and reporting it to mods.
38,"Exposing the harms of SRS goes against a narrative, so of course that's against the rules.

Threatening women with violence though? Perfectly fine according to Reddit.

39,r/terfisaslur material.
40,The post got deleted. Good. I searched that sub on the word terf and wow the things you find. Reported all for threatening violence :)
41,Can you post to r/terfisaslur?
42,You won’t believe this one weird trick to get away with ANY crime
43,They talk so much shit but the only thing they can hurt is themselves
44,wow love how the comments are all getting downvoted TIM/Fs mad
45,We need to report these things to the admins.
46,"Reported.
I should do it more often."
47,"r/ neopenisdisasters, right?"
48,Did this get removed? I tried to find it to report but I couldn't.
49,Another reason to carry
50,"The admins are not banning subreddits for posting pictures of surgeries - they are banning subreddits which encourage people to take pictures from other subreddits and gloat about how the surgeries went wrong - it's vile and hateful.

Having said that, if the admins are banning vile and hateful subreddits, then the one in the link deserves to be on the list, for encouraging hate and incitement to violence."
51,Same. It's only a matter of time before we see one of these bats admitted in a murder trial.
52,"Wanna believe it more?

/r/transmaxxing"
53,"They lie and say ""TERFs"" are responsible for the violent men that murder trans people, which by the way are usually trans male prostitutes (in Brazil) and even though radfems are against prostitution it's still somehow our fault. I've still yet to have it explained to me how it's a woman's fault when a man decides to kill another man because we ""outed"" said trans identified man even though their own features, attitudes, and voices are what out them."
54,Because TERFs tell the truth about them.
55,"Oh I have, and everyone else should too. you search words like ""violence"" or ""terfs"" in their subs you can literally just report en masse a billion posts just like these, they don't hide their violent desires even a little."
56,Playing whack a mole or just wasting your time for fun?  You can't get rid of all us terfs.
57,"Unless you live in Canada, cause they’re about done with that crap."
58,You mean the subreddit that was banned? Yes it was /r/ NVD
59,They are ALL disasters.  Look wherever you like; none of them look like dicks.
60,"Oh wow if it already got removed then this is super effective, and we should report other violent content on that sub too"
61,[deleted]
62,links?
63,Well that was quite a rabbithole.
64,"Right? TERFs have ""blood on their hands"" is what I have heard so much from them - and what about them? How much blood do they have on their hands? Just to accommodate their petty comfort politics we ought to stop talking about women getting brutalised and killed everywhere. We ought to merge gay/lesbian movements with their doubly regressive/reinforcing values. We ought to change the definition of the very basis of oppression because they want to feel oppressed first and foremost. And most importantly, it's the TERFs who should take the fall for the problem all along - men and their violence!"
65,"No, they don't hide it. It's really telling. (And surprise! violently male. 'Someone disagrees with my sexist portrayal of women! Better threaten them with a bat!'.) And thank you for what you do! I also report it if I see it. We'll see if anything comes of it."
66,"Be sure to report under site-wide rules, not to the subreddit moderators. 

Inciting violence is against TOS and should get them a three day ban."
67,"As a Canadian, I sincerely wish that was the case. It doesn't look like it to be frank."
68,"I meant, that bat is somebody’s penis like the NV’s on NVD were V’s."
69,"I don't know if it did, I just can't find it. But reddit's search sucks so I honestly can't tell."
70,A lot of radical feminists are just as bad though - I've seen them in the GC subreddit revelling around horror stories
71,"No, of course not, the entire subreddit has been closed down"
72,No fucking kidding. I can’t believe I just found the trap version of Red Pill.
73,Rule 1 of misogyny: everything a man does is a woman's fault.
74,They have the most blood on their hands for supporting the sex trafficking and ssx industry that creates so many trans prostitutes.
75,"Yes, this - reporting to the subs mods won't do anything at all."
76,/s lol
77,Why do they always use the *child* form of male and female?
78,What strikes me most about this is that they're still dudes who are uncomfortable with the word 'vagina'. VAGINA VAGINA VAGINA VAGINA
79,"I kept wondering why they always use fictional characters for this stupid “x character says trans rights”. 

Then I realized that they all live in a fictional world their minds have created so of course they’re gonna take other fictional characters to say this “trans rights” shit."
80,"I wonder if they know no one over the age of 14 who doesn't have severe autism cares about what ""Glimmer"" has to say"
81,You can tell they’re raised as men because they constantly threaten violence against women. 🙄
82,Since when has it been a ‘right’ to change the meaning of words?
83,Who tf is the character in this shitty meme?
84,It's really creepy how they turn every cartoon character they can into some frothing-at-the-mouth woman hater.
85,"why is everything a cartoon character for them?

perpetual man-children?"
86,Yaaawn...
87,"Has it completely vanished for anyone or just me? I was in the middle of reporting it to the Admins through the online form. Went back into my saved posts and it has vanished, not on the front page either and it was like 5 minutes ago when I first looked."
88,why aren't they banned/quarantined ?
89,"NOOO My poor Glimmer!

Why? Why would you use an innocent kids show character to threaten people? :c"
90,[removed]
91,We don’t we just like having fun about it because y’all are super harsh on use we like to make a joke about it we don’t want a cartoon charter to actually stand up for us we can do that ourself
92,They usually turn out to be pedophiles.
93,"Well, to be fair, 'vulva' is also a proper medical term. It's another of these shitty 'we want to maim you, TERFs, but not really, tee-hee' kind of memes, but it would've been even shittier if they went with the term 'pussy' (which is what they do, at least most of the time)."
94,Hit the nail right on the head.
95,"I feel embarrassed to like the show, but it has strong positive female characters, good plot, and normalized lesbian representation that don't immediately get murdered or fuck a man.  That said I am only mildly autistic.  :P"
96,I’m 16 no autism and love glimmer she shows a strong female lead and is a better leader than anyone else on the sub
97,"Glimmer from She-Ra, which is funny because she is the character most easily manipulated by the opinions of others and is usually wrong and puts others in danger because of her misguided actions."
98,Obsessed with anime/cartoons and wish they lived in a fantasy world where they can be whatever they want? Even calling them man-children seems a little light.
99,"If you report a post, it is automatically hidden from your page - you can 'unhide' it if you go to your userpage and click on all your 'hidden' posts"
100,Hahahahahahaha threatening violence against women is so funny! So original! Men haven't been doing that to us since the beginning of time!!
101,This is literally violence.
102,"I mean.

The creator of this is basically threatening to remove people's kidneys using a character from a kids show. Pretty sure it counts as violence, not as having fun."
103,"It is, but vulva is not the female equivalent of a penis. They're grossed out by the word 'vagina' just like teen boys. Also, Vulva almost sounds like the name of a female superhero."
104,"I genuinely do not understand how you people think that using some fictional character to parrot  your opinions somehow validates that opinion & that any ""terf"" is going to look at that and feel any emotion, but utter embarrassment for the person who made it lmao. Do you not see how that makes you look delusional?"
105,I can only imagine how sad your life is if your leaders are fictional characters
106,lol exactly and she basically goes so off the rails as to almost destroying the world in S4 (love her character tho pretty well developed)
107,Not to mention an insult to every actual child I’ve ever met
108,Thank you! I had no idea it did that.
109,"Fair point

That said, them using 'vulva' instead of 'pussy' is still an improvement in my eyes"
110,"English isn't my first language so I gotta ask; I thought the vulva is the exterior parts of the female sex organ, so how is it not the female equivalent of a penis? Isn't the vagina the connection between the vulva and the cervix/uterus? I tried googling this but I just got confused because I read about it in both Swedish and English, sorry for a (probably) dumb question."
111,"Yes, at least, this hate-meme isn't scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel. Can you just imagine what's going on inside the head of someone who decides to spend his time making this crap? And what the rejected ideas pile looks like?"
112,"There is likely a more accurate non-user edited comparison somewhere, but here's the wikipedia of m/f related sex organs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_related_male_and_female_reproductive_organs

I'll also add that I think another reason they make the comparison to vulva is because the srs docs actually try to reproduce the visible whereas even MTTs are seemingly willing to admit that hole created to stand in for a vagina has very little in common with an actual vagina."
113,"Thank you so much for the link and explanation! Now I understand what you meant. There was a nuance of language there I couldn't quite wrap my head around at first, but now I get it."
114,"You’re welcome. And, yeah, it’s definitely not a 1:1 sort of inverted mirror image of the other so, as you say, the nuances of what’s chosen as a proxy are telling."
115,These straight white guys want to be oppressed so badly.  If they actually experienced it they'd surely stop glamourizing the idea.
116,Men are the most oppressed women 😂
117,"We live in a world where a middle class man in a first world country can say that he is more oppressed than a young girl getting her vulva mutilated, being forced to marry while still a child and getting raped by her “husband”. Yeah."
118,"Oh my fuck. I’ve actually never been so angry at a post before this one. 
These men need to visit a third world country and witness women who have been subjected to  atrocious treatment to see what actual oppression is. 
“Most oppressed women on the planet?” 
I’m pretty sure a little girl who is raped by 5 different male family members before she is 10 might disagree."
119,"Who cares about the rape victims in the Middle East that get stoned to death, someone said women don't have penises!!"
120,"LOLLLLLLL imagine wealthy white men wearing shitty lingerie they bought at Spencer's makes them the most ""oppressed women on earth,"" that's fucjing disgusting. Literally any woman in a third world country has it worse than those smegmoids could ever dream of. I absolutely despise these ""people"""
121,MEN ARE NOT WOMEN.
122,*Saudi Arabia and India have entered the chat*
123,"I constantly feel actual oppression working in a university as a woman. Despite getting my work done and being told I am doing a great job, I am interrupted, asked to stay back from important meetings so that I can do administrative work, I'm left out of things I need to know, and almost never given actual feedback. My boss  lets his meetings run into ours regularly, and when we are in a meeting he answers emails and ignores me while I'm talking. I might never be taken seriously at this job. And it's because I was born with a female body. Not because I decided I have special gender feelings that are going to have guide my entire life and personality. I sure fucking wish I could identify myself out of this, because at this point it's a dull, never ending migraine of the soul."
124,"""mOsT OPprEsSeD wOMen On tHe PLanEt!"""
125,"If I had to pick the most oppressed women on the planet I would pick the ones that have their clitoris and labia removed then being sewn up with only a little hole to pee and menstruate out of to keep them ""pure and faithful"" for future husbands.  Or women and girls being sold into sexual slavery because men are perverts.  Both are pretty high on my list.

Men who play dress up aren't oppressed."
126,"Far right: white men are oppressed by women

Far left: white men are oppressed by women"
127,"Even if I bought that TWAW, I don't know how they would be the most oppressed women. I feel like we just skipped over this whole explanation of how people not recognizing your inner identity is the worst oppression ever."
128,"""Most oppressed"" ""women"" on the planet....?

That's not even ""citation needed"".  You're gonna need several books worth of evidence to justify that ridiculous statement. I'll be waiting..."
129,But you're not a woman tho? Sooooo... 🤷‍♀️
130,"Can't remember the name of the book, but it was about a woman who survived being sold as a sex slave (as a child) in Vietnam.

The sentence that turned my stomach was her talking about the room she ""worked"" in reeking of sperm,  and how that smell made her sick."
131,"That's true, their ideas of oppression is simply acknowledging who they truly are."
132,There seems to be an implication here that male women are more oppressed than *any* female women

139,Lmao it *would* be Spencer's.
140,Spencer’s 😂 💀
141,The most self-oppressed men on the planet lol
142,"Only men could oppress women for thousands of years and then turn around, put a dress on, and claim to be the most oppressed group of all time."
143,How are they different from MRAs?
144,It's almost like the entire movement is men's rights.
145,Male women is an oxymoron.
146,"In general, the murder rate of trans people is way below the murder rate of the general population. And, specifically, a black MtF dude in the U.S. has a lower chance of being murdered than his non-trans male peers."
147,You mean that handful of trans black prostitutes who get murdered by johns every year that y'all exploit for victim points?
148,That's due to the high risk lives they lead.
149,"Yeah exactly, they don't view that as oppression so they never count it. They mean things like ""lesbians won't fuck me"""
150,"You are aware FtM trans people exist, right?"
151,MRA...with PIZZAZZ

Boy oh boy would I love to see a source for that one"
154,FtM people don't usually attack anyone by my experience (which isn't much considering I've only gotten one harassment pm - I told him I was a minor and he deleted his account lol)
155,I abide by the dictionary definition of woman. I'm not going to let men steal our language.
156,"[26 trans women killed in 2018. ](https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-transgender-community-in-2019) 

[3895 women killed in 2016, 12% increase from previous year ](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-homicide-rate-female-victims-of-homicide-rose-by-21-percent-according-to-study-2018-12-6/). 


You do the math."
157,"That's fair enough, but unfortunately they have already taken the word ''woman'' and trashed it. The dictionary will be updated as soon as they can figure out how to define the word without it being either a circular definition or a nonsense."
158,"Trans women are something like 0.3% of the population vs about 50% for cis women, so based on the numbers you gave trans women already have an 11% higher risk. That's ignoring the fact that trans women victims are substantially undercounted as your own link very clearly points out. The number for all women comes from actual statistics recorded from every murder, whereas the number for trans women comes from advocates curating whatever news stories they can find.

Most trans victims will just be recorded as one sex or the other, with no record of them being trans unless they're publicly out and someone happens to mention that in a news article, and that news article happens to be published on the internet and then happens to be found by an advocacy organization."
159,"They can't though. That's the thing. I'm keeping the word, language has power."
160,"Percentages aren’t always the best way to measure things. Especially in such a huge discrepancy in population size (women vs trans women). Like you said it’s .3% of the population, of course every additional number is going to make the percentage higher. 


Even knowing that they aren’t always accurately recorded, isn’t it pretty obvious that women are killed more? Like you really think there a few thousand trans women deaths that are just not being recorded?"
161,"I admire your efforts to turn back the tide, and cheer for you, but unfortunately I have already retreated to the next line of defence which is to fiercely defend the word ''female'' ... they are coming for it and I'm not giving it up without a fight"
162,"Yes, ""every additional number is going to make the percentage higher"", that's kind of my point?

If there were a few thousand trans women deaths alongside the few thousand cis women deaths, that would make trans women hundreds of times more likely to be murdered, not equally likely to be murdered. Do you seriously not understand how proportions work or are you just screwing with me?

It's not ""pretty obvious"" that cis women are killed more, given that I did just demonstrate that trans women are killed more"
163,"I’m saying when the population sample is so incredibly tiny compared to a enormously larger population percentages don’t make sense as a metric to use. I know how proportions work, and I also know that percentages aren’t always the proper metric to use, such as in this case where one population is around a million or less, and the other is around 167 million. More women are killed every year than trans women. This is literal facts. And shit this is even going off numbers I spent ten seconds looking up, I’ve seen numbers that show a higher murder rate for men and women than trans men and women but I have no idea where I saw them. Either way I’m not saying it’s not important that 26 whole humans were killed in a single year, that’s awful and sickening. But if we compare it to the number of women killed it doesn’t really compare. 


Not to mention the root of all this is men being responsible for the *vast* majority of these killings of trans women, not feminists. The real focus should be on the males who commit these crimes, not radfems."
164,"In these supposed situations where percentages just don't work, I'm pretty sure the standard operating procedure isn't to give up and say ""well 3895 is bigger than 26 so fuck it whatever"". By that logic no minority group ever matters.

I hope you'll understand if I trust the actual numbers and the statistical considerations provided by your source over these different numbers in conflict with the actual numbers which you ""saw once but idk where"""
165,">I'm pretty sure the standard operating procedure isn't to give up and say ""well 3895 is bigger than 26 so fuck it whatever"". By that logic no minority group ever matters.


Do you lack reading comprehension? I said specifically that 26 was still a terrible amount of people."
166,Breaking news: a woman with short hair gives birth.
167,That white people magazine image will never not be a hilarious addition to just about anything.
168,Straights r wild
169,"I didn't remember this one so i looked it up. Some of the other pictures are wild (?). And it's quite old fashioned in a way saying fell pregnant.

170,"Huh.

Kind of odd the only thing that gets them attention is giving birth.

Almost like there is a pattern here?"
171,I dont want to bring race but notice how all the attention-seeking TRAs are white?
172,Am I cute uwu
173,i mean it's cute and im happy for them but why the fuck is it news
174,🏆
175,"“Fell” pregnant is the typical UK terminology for getting pregnant, but yes, it’s a very old school way of saying got/am pregnant. Has always felt icky to me honestly, despite the linguistic difference giving context."
176,"Guys I hate to point it out but this couple is from Ecuador.  

The father of the baby is most certainly not white (link is in another comment thread) and the mother (the birther)  is probably not white either though I'm not positive."
177,"Because white people are inundated with the oppressor/victim  narrative and they hate themselves for it so any opportunity they get to put themselves into an oppressed minority category alleviates their guilt by association. "" look at me I'm one of the suffering downtrodden too! I can't be one of the bad guys!"""
178,It absolutely comes from a position of white privilege. No one else would volunteer for more ridicule and harassment in exchange for attention.
179,You're obsessed with race you horrible brown goblin.
180,"At least it's not ""she got herself pregnant""!. That was widely used too. I mean, it couldn't be less true."
181,"Yeah typical white people thing, you are very right, This isn't only limited to TRAs but all other aspects of society."
182,"Progress was being made. Gay marriage was legalized. The right to choose was being argued. Foreign policy was being questioned. Black rights were at the forefront. #blacklivesmatter gained traction. 

... then all of the sudden all of these white guys want to talk about how oppressed they are. Transgender issues take the forefront, which makes no sense because it’s such an INSIGNIFICANT number of the population in comparison to how many other minorities who were fighting to be heard.

I’ve been accidentally climbing toward my peak and I can feel these thoughts flickering in the back of my head."
183,"Hah yes, agreed. Far better than “got herself” pregnant!"
184,"> Why do I feel like such a hypocrite?!

...because you are a hypocrite. 

And someone who threatens to hurt or kill themselves when reality doesn’t conform to their expectations is an emotional terrorist."
185,Sounds like someone needs to unlearn their genital fetish!
186,"Someone go tell him that the thoughts he had when having sex with another ""trans lesbian"" are the exact same thoughts that people have when they have sex with him too."
187,"You're having those thoughts because you're a straight man, not a lesbian."
188,They won't even fuck each other because they know the truth.
189,"And then everyone tells him it’s okay meanwhile lesbians are horrible awful bigots!!

Hate it so much."
190,"""Lesbians don't wanna go down on me 'cause I'm just too male down there.""

191,"Because you've been sold a lie, m'laddo."
192,These people I just can’t anymore.

204,"who would have thought that lesbians dont want to suck your dick, he doesnt even have a girldick FFS /s"
205,"Basically, all the posters are hypocrites too, telling themselves that genitalia does matter afterall"
206,"Same, it anyone has it, hit me up"
207,I haven’t seen it so I’m not sure of what the replies were. The /s was for the part about lesbians since I don’t think lesbians are bigots for not being interested in transwomen.

213,These people are just so afraid of gatekeeping anything to the point that no words can have meaning.
214,"He/him lesbian??????

Does not compute"
215,"The word female/woman means nothing to them, homo(sex)ual means nothing to them. To them those are just masks you can put on and take off at will if you feel like it.


Yet they accuse us ""terfs"" of LiTeRalLy TrYiNg tO eRaSe tRaNs & NonBinArY PeOpLe!! all the damn time."
216,What the hell is a bi lesbian? That one’s new.
217,"It’s almost like everything after the first line is not a lesbian, that’s the trick they’re missing. It’s so simple it’s fucking stupid."
218,"If you're non-binary, or enby, as they call it and you claim to be a homosexual, attracted to other women exclusively, that means you're a woman. If you're apparently a lesbian, you're a girl, otherwise you aren't."
219,"People really need to absolutely stfu about ""bi lesbians"" do you not realize what a contradiction that is. You can be bi with a preference to woman, that's 100% fine. Just stop stealing from lesbians, its embarrassing."
220,"The hell is a bi lesbian? And a he/him lesbian? LMAO

A lesbian is a woman! It can't be a he! What the hell"

226,I dont get why gatekeeping is bad. I see people in fandoms say dont gatekeep and after a while they all turn to shit
227,"""bisexual lesbians""

Sigh."
228,Bisexual lesbian? Those are two different categories!
229,He/Him lesbian is the one that made me pause.
230,Idk what is an enby lesbian either?
231,Nonsense. You are a bisexual... that's it. But they are trying to also Identify as lesbians. Then they cry about Biphobic Erasure.
232,I'm a bi cis woman and I don't feel entitled to access lesbian-only spaces unless I know that that bi women are also welcome. Probably because I don't have a male sense of entitlement.
233,Yep. I'm bi and would never dare to go to a lesbian only space. Even though I like women more than men. But we need to respect their spaces. I wouldnt want white people at a non white people meeting. It's not discrimination. It's called having your own spaces. And there are plenty spaces where you overlap.
234,"It's dumb, and it's not like lesbians exclude bi women anyway. Well not that I've found."
235,It's the Lesbian equivalent of when Gay men use she or Mary.
236,"He/him lesbians are women, who like women, but like he/him pronouns."
237,"So basically if you're an afab enby, you're allowed."
238,I dont think they know what a social construct is...
239,"The bisexual lesbians bothered me slightly, but idm that much.
He/him lesbians are literally just lesbians who like he/him pronouns 🤷‍♂️ I don’t see the issue"
240,When I first saw it it was a female homosexual with a super special gender identity™ but now it's been opened up to males who sometimes don't even take hormones and don't bother to call themselves women but want to fuck (r*pe) lesbians
241,"It really makes no sense in their logic. If a lesbian is a woman attracted to women, and a woman is a gender not a sex, but their nb which is it's own gender...?"
242,"It’s just people trying to shove themselves into every exclusive space because they really think they’re that freaking relevant. I’m bisexual and never in a million years I’ll try to enter a lesbian-exclusive space if I’m not welcome in it, it’s just plain disrespectful."
243,"Mmmno there's unfortunately groups of lesbians who say bi people are ""untrustworthy"" because they're also attracted to men. 

The way I see it in terms of spaces. If a space is called a ""lesbian space"" it's for lesbians only. ""WLW space"" is open to all woman who are attracted to woman."
244,"I agree that bi women need to stop calling themselves bi lesbian. But as a bisexual woman, there's definitely been plenty of lesbians who didn't want me involved in wlw spaces, or didnt want to date me after finding out I was also into men."
245,Why are you on this sub? Genuinely curious.
246,"I don’t get why these people don’t understand that the terms straight, gay male, lesbian and bisexual are all mutually exclusive. One cannot be two or more of them by the definition of each of the terms. You can be a bisexual in a heterosexual relationship in which case you are still bisexual, or bisexual in a homosexual relationship in which case, you guessed it, still a bisexual. Being into trans doesn’t exempt you from these either because all trans people have either a male or a female body (they may well have mutilated it but it still remains either male or female). For all the LGBT educators they seem to have out there at the moment they don’t seem to have any grasp on the bloody fundamentals."
247,"Weird it’s almost like if we strip meaning from everything the result is a clusterfuck, who could have ever foreseen this?"
248,Wow- that’s so messed up.
249,I respect your position. But there are events that are Inclusive.
250,"I mean, I don’t know why bisexuals wouldn’t be welcome when we are WLW also. Sure lesbian exclusive spaces are okay but I don’t see the point in exclusion when bisexuals are also into women. I do understand some experiences can vary. That being said I’m not going to go into lesbian exclusive spaces if they don’t want it, lord knows lesbians give enough hate to bisexuals as it is and I don’t want to deal with that bs."
251,"I hate myself, mostly.
But also because I genuinely do not see the issue with a woman using he/him pronouns. If you don’t believe trans people exist, what’s wrong with using different pronouns? It’s not changing your gender or mutilating themselves."
252,"No, it’s PrOgReSs"
253,"Everyone hates bisexuals. Not in a violent oppression way (except the homophobes), just in a general “ew lol” way. And they all have their own special way as follows:

Straight men: fetishize because “girl on girl” but still think you’re a slut or a liar for women, general homophobia for men

Gay men: general misogyny for women, not gay enough i.e. “gold star only” for men

Straight women: always think you’re hitting on them OR you’re doing it for attention OR will let you kiss them and go down on them but think *your* vagina is gross, general homophobia “he’s just gay but won’t admit it” for men

Lesbians: you’re doing it for attention or not gay enough for women, general (if deserved) distaste for maleness for men

Trans: mad that you won’t immediately date them for both genders, especially mad for women

There isn’t a group of people on earth who can just chill tf out and accept bisexuals except other bisexuals. Don’t bother looking for it, I’ve tried and it doesn’t exist."
254,I'm personally fine with it.
255,Are there really women who identify as women and still want to be called he/him?
256,"some women take on gendered honorifics like ""sir"" in militant positions, historically some lesbians went by he/him for protection, and there was that one character ""daddy"" on orange is the new black who was clearly a lesbian woman but preferred for her partners to refer to her with male pronouns

so yes, but also not really."
257,"He/him lesbians are cisgendered women who like using masculine pronouns. So, yes. 
They were more precedent in the years before legal homosexuality, so they could blend in and all that. But now it’s more of a comfort thing."
258,"Misgendering hurts, y'all. Rape? Nbd. Calling a convicted criminal by their pre-transition name? LITERAL VIOLENCE."
259,"Jeezus, they literally care more about rapists than women ..."
260,Reporting to the police? What are they going to do 😂
261,How can someone unironically back rapists as the moral high ground?
262,What on God's green earth is this backwards garbage
263,"Big shock that TRAs like MRAs are very concerned with rapists' ""rights""."
264,I would gladly go to jail before calling a man a woman.
265,"TRA: trans women aren’t violent you idiot! They just want to use the bathroom!!! 

Also TRA: Use the rapists proper pronouns because they are trans!!!!!"
266,TRAs=rapist protection
267,"So a hate criminal is a member of the group they committed the hate crime against?

because they *identify* in that way?"
268,The point of this is to enforce our silence.
269,They're right. Raping people is nowhere near as bad as misgendering. I hope those brave rapists are reporting those TERFS to the police.
270,My pronouns are Get Off/My Lawn.
271,"You know they’re men because the feeling of the rapist are more important than the fact that he’s a rapist 

No woman would ever demand respect for a predator"
272,I saw the againsthatesubs people bitching about people not using a CHILD MOLESTOR’S preferred pronouns. Come the fuck on. They’re psychos.
273,"Men will always defend men over women.

See the vox article calling a judge dismissing a rapist pedophile who made child porn wanting to be called “she” “surprisingly cruel”."
274,Men are fucking evil
275,"I mean, if you found your identity through forced feminization pr0n, rape is kinda central to your life.  Might explain why it’s their go-to threat."
276,"Why do people think like this? If u wanna act like a woman be confident in the ""fact"" that you are one. I mean, ""cis"" ppl don't take offense when someone calls them the wrong pronouns? It seems like a huge excuse."
277,"Seriously.  This amount of craziness is what I expected from 2019.  It’s a new decade, let’s bury “misgendering is LITERAL VIOLENCE,” and forget to give it a headstone."
278,"Yes, because those rapists are men."
279,"They showed up to Kate Scottow's house and arrested her, so they can do that."
280,I guess you haven't heard what's been going on in the UK: arrest you. Misgendering laws are already on the books in New York and California but AFAIK no one has been arrested yet.
281,"""Officer Jones speaking. Ah, yes, so this paedophile had his feelings hurt? Mhm, yeah, mhmm, let me put you on speakerphone, we had a really shit day and can really use a good laugh here."""
282,I've seen more than one trans person say it would be evil to misgender Hitler. Literally -- *Hitler.*
283,I’ll be your cell mate.
284,"pretty much...

You do not see this many actual female sex offenders"
285,I just hope they ended up in a genital appropriate prison. Be a woman all you want but if you're swinging a dick it's the male prison for you!
286,"The thing is, in order for their narrative to work, it has to be universal. Meaning *every* person who identifies as trans *is* trans, even if they're truly awful people. You can't stop it just because a person is evil. It's like how we still let Bill Cosby have human pronouns and don't call him ""it."""
287,Completely agree. Die TERFs and long live the trans rapists !
288,I’m old enough to adopt this if asked.
289,"Yep its super easy to arrest someone in the UK for misgendering yet racism, sexism, anti-semitism, islamophobia, and xenophobia is ignored unless its done by a public official/celeb or violence is included."
290,Thats fucked up
291,The law in California so far as I know is narrowly restricted to nursing home settings to prevent care workers from misgendering resident Ts.
292,"Nah, even with that junk turned inside out they’re still men and are still likely to be violent towards women. Maybe put them in a separate area with other TIMs, but not with women."
293,The root of the problem is indulging their pronouns for any reason.
294,"There is a case to be made that there are some specific symptoms of dysphoria, and certain actions that are not consistent with those symptoms. You could still say that somebody flaunting the traits of their birth sex does not have dysphoria, since it would be impossible for them to do that if they were, and therefore isn't trans."
295,"I'm glad someone said this.

I don't like how the trans community uses pronouns, but their stance on them is one of principal rather than favoritism."
296,"A separate wing would be best until someone yells ""cruel and unusual."" Then we got pre-op for each sex and post-op for each.

And does the system pay for treatments and medications?"
297,"So a ""transman"" getting pregnant basically proves that person is not trans."
298,"idk, but theres some things that would"
299,"If anyone but a trans person spoke like that, they would get the, “Maybe it’s time to find a therapist” talk."
300,Everything is a perceived slight against their character.
301,...that is some incel impotent rage shit right there. One degree of separation from men who hit their female partners for 'deserving a pop in the mouth because they said something I don't like'. Imagine that but with your own kid. Jesus christ.
302,"The transcult: TERFs want us to ""die and not EXIST""

Also the transcult: The sound of women's voices EXISTING makes me start LITERALLY SHAKING"
303,"There used to be this great meme somewhere that said that the difference between transgenders and women is the difference between male hubris and human nature. Transgenders are a ""becoming"", while women are just an ""is"": no extreme surgeries, no doctor's appointment, no hormones, no pills needed to simply BE a woman.

And the more transgenders try to BECOME, the further they take themselves from the effortless ""is"" that is the natural woman they want to become; they try so hard, they are willing to ruin their bodies, their minds, their cultures in order to ""become"" - and the harder they try, the further they take themselves away from it and the more they become Frankenstein's caricature.

And so also this man will develop more and more rage and hatred towards women who simply ""are"", the more he tries to ""become"" one. He will mutilate his body, ruin his health, ruin his mind, try to bully and blackmail people into silence and submission - and the more he tries to ""become"" a woman, the more rage he will feel against people who just effortlessly ARE women..."
304,But it's not a mental illness.
305,That whole sub is a fuckin trip.
306,"Incels morphing into transcels.

Absolutely zero difference. 

Plus, they are both men."
307,"This TIM I know posted some angry rant recently about the fact that they’ve made Mrs. Doubtfire a musical. 

Now, I don’t really love that idea either (mostly because it makes me even sadder than I already was about Robin Williams). But in trying to understand why this was so insulting to him, I realized that he feels entitled to the entire world pretending that everyone who puts on a dress *is* a woman and the existence of men who wear dresses for other reasons is insulting. 

Like, the only way his life works is if there is no evidence that we know the actual truth."
308,But it's perfectly safe for these people to come into our spaces.
309,JFC! So much jealousy and envy of  women and girls because they ARE Female and don't need voice lessons.
310,"misogyny and narcissism, the two best traits"
311,Are cross dressing guys the ultimate incel rage? It seems so. Imagine being so bad at being a man that you dress as a woman and get mad at actual women for being women lol
312,"haha, yeah it's actually pretty funny. ""Conform to gender or else I'm offended"""
313,"Cross dressing/GNC guys aren’t the issue here. Men can be feminine without trying to be a woman, and it isn’t possible to “dress as a woman” because “woman” just means “adult human female” regardless of whether you’re wearing pants or a skirt."
314,oh let’s all cry a bit for the poor men affected by men’s actions
315,"According to them, biological females don’t exist."
316,That's definitely cursed lmao
317,Trans men are never misogynistic ever.
318,"Because women with vaginas aren't worthy of being women especially since transwomen are so much better at it. They've been practicing a long time afterall and have got it down. Natal women never had to practice at it and just haven't been able to get it right. Somebody needed to take over. It's been such a travesty how natal women have been so horrible portraying ""The Fairer Sex"" that the transwomen have had to take over and show the world how it's done proper. Frankly natal women especially lesbians should be grateful for the instruction and suck their girldicks."
319,"Intersex people: ""For the nth time, stop fucking tagging me, Greg.""  

Black women: ""Whew."""
320,"GNC men don't experience misogyny because they aren't fucking female, but thanks."
321,“Cis women” don’t matter to them.
322,"""Dealing with misogyny"" = ""Attempting to cloud the meaning and pretending it doesn't exist"""
323,"Ooooh, the irony.

TRAs = MRAs"
324,"Ah yes. The insufferable, bearded male enbies crawling all over feminist spaces surely know what it’s like to experience misogyny. Definitely. 🙄"
325,This is shit.
326,The only people that remotely deal with misogyny is “trans-men” intersex women and “girl nb’s” because they are still biologically female and always will be. None of those other people deal with it and never will they are just men perpetuating it.
327,">GNC people

Leave me out of this, thanks. Ugh."
328,"I wonder how many trans men/AFAB enbies are just women who ""aren't like other girls"" and are misogynistic themselves."
329,">Intersex people: ""For the nth time, stop fucking tagging me, Greg.""  
>  
>Black women: ""Whew.""

😂😂😂😂 

This post was so good. 

Interex people are so fed up for getting ignored by everyone... except the only very people, they don't want to be associated with.

And for once, the trans cult forgot their own dogma, Black Women are not real women to them."
330, 🤣
331,"I think homophobia against gay men is rooted in misogyny.

A man not ""acting'' like a man, but a woman?

Notice the worst thing you can call a man is female based?"
332,they use cis women in their memes some times lol
333,Real women deal with misogyny on a daily basis. It's never a remote thing for most of us.
334,Yep. My thoughts exactly.
335,What does GNC mean?
336,">I wonder how many trans men/AFAB enbies are just women who ""aren't like other girls"" and are misogynistic themselves.

Each one of them."
337,"Homophobia and misogyny are different and distinct. They may have similarities, but misogyny is the hatred of women."
338,"Gender non-conforming. A butch woman, for example, is GNC.

EDIT: just FYI mods, that was an autocorrect."
339,"I think they intersect quite often sometimes. Like a man acting femininely will be be looked down on because he’s ‘acting gay’ or ‘acting like a woman’ or a mix of the two. Anything not masculine is automatically either (or both) ‘gay’  or ‘womanly’, which is obviously rooted in both the hatred and disdain for homosexuality and women"
340,"Yes, there's an intersection. However, they are experiencing homophobia, not misogyny."
341,You're right.
342,Yeah I agree
343,"Yeah, good point.

Both of them are unacceptable obviously."
344,Holy shit. Literally imagine hating women this much. I can't do it.
345,Exhibit #473829847 that these dudes have never spoken to a real woman in their entire lives
346,...And this is a good meme? This meme sucks like all their others.
347,They are only thinking about cis men because only men exist. Right?
348,Lolololol they are SO male. Had some nasty fucking dude harass me yesterday when I was walking from my car into the pharmacy ffs.
349,Are you fucking kidding me. I’ve been harassed by men in the street on a regular basis since I was a preteen. They’re so clueless.
350,"These are the same pathetic dudes that think being catcalled is uwu sO vAliDaTiNgggg**~ girly eUphOrIc gAsM~~* 

Idiots, all of them."
351,"SO boring to be mentally stable and confident in your identity as a woman, right? 💁🏻‍♀️ SO boring when you’re not a misogynist blow up doll whose entire identity revolves around pleasing men. 💃🏻"
352,I'll never understand their obsession with Sylveon. Leave Sylveon alone you idiots
353,"Everything about this is aggravating. They just love to act as if they're somehow the most oppressed people on the planet, and then they glorify it? Since when was being mentally ill a good thing?"
354,"I've always hated the whole ""being straight/cis is so boring xD"" thing because it just screams"" i dont have a personality outside being queer"" 

Also I'm shocked that comment wasnt downvoted into fucking infinity, even for a TRA sub that's some fucking dumbass shit."
355,"Bio women are the default. trans women wouldn't exist if they didn't have us to imitate from, including our life experiences they like to claim to have. (I.e. the lies about having periods)"
356,"Yes, (relative) mental health is boring."
357,reminds me of how incels always say women aren't funny
358,That isn’t even close to a good meme wtf 😂
359,"Especially the title, that’s what really pisses me off. Yes, it’s soooo boring not constantly wanting to be on hormones and vanity surgery and raging at women who speak their mind. Hey newsflash to any TRA lurkers: just because someone’s life doesn’t revolve around special gender magic doesn’t mean they are boring. It’s actually pretty much the opposite."
360,Yeah this makes me angry. More proof they're not oppressed or even familiar with the concept.
361,"Oh lord I have a trans woman friend who told me that once, it's not a good thing holy shit- 

If you want to be a woman, be at very least an ally for women."
362,"i didn't start getting catcalled until midway into adulthood because i've always looked like 10 years younger than my actual age but wasn't very pretty to look at either so i grew up and started dressing more feminine in public and i started -finally- getting the catcalls i was told to expect and i was honestly just disappointed at how low level they all were. it was, and is -child's play- for me to turn around and one up, five up, ten up whatever the hell they just said to me and respond to someone snickering and saying i have a nice ass with a chipper and excitable ""hey you too! how do you feel about pegging?"" or ""i'd like to take you home"" ""can my boyfriend come?"" ""he can watch"" ""oh no, you don't get a turn until you watch the tutorial""
endless melting and shuffling from gross intoxicated low-lives makes me feel a little better about people sniffing me out for sex now just because i look like i have a palatable vagina."
363,"Sylveon has the colors of the trans flag. I mean, it's just a normal combination of pastel colors and I doubt pokemon devs even know trans people exist, but yeah."
364,It also heavily implies that it's a choice and they're just doing it for fun and not because of any serious underlying conditions.
365,"Where the fuck you find this trans women? All the trans women I know (including me) that were catcalled in some form were literally in panic every time they get catcalled and none of them said to me ever that this makes them feel validated? It’s horrible, doesn’t make me feel validated, it makes me feel anxiety and in danger."
366,"What's even more wild is that in the pokemon games the gender ratio for Eevee is 7:1 for male to female.

Ergo most Sylveons are also male."
367,"Well GameFreak apparently made a reference to them in XY. A random beauty trainer (female only class) mentioned that she was a black belt before, a class exclusive to men (females have a different class name). The Japanese script thanks science for her transformation.

And of course every transpokefan probably knows her name."
368,"I don't know dude. I'm guessing it's the trans women who find more to fetishize form it. Theres this one twitter trans woman who draws comics about her experiences and made a comic about the same experience once, getting cat called and being into it.

It's wild but they exist."
369,Oh god
370,"I saw this not too long ago. Her next two tweets are:

>	“And on top of feeling incredibly sad for myself, what is upsetting is knowing I'm far from the only one. Hell, two of my former close ftm friends have the exact same story - same age, same surgeries, both are into women & never had sex or even a relationship prior to transition.

>	And of course now children are being put on puberty blockers and more and more teens are starting HRT and interfering with their body maturing the way it was supposed to... Inevitably making it even harder to figure out sexuality...”


Honestly, really heartbreaking tweets."
371,"I keep saying this but in 10 to 15 years we’ll look back at this period of when the scandal of lesbian women and gay men were encouraged to embark upon drastic surgeries and hormone treatments and are detransing looking for answers and someone to blame.

I bet you not one of the LGB cheerleaders, medical professionals, media outlets or radical trans activists admit that they were wrong. But hey, it’s all collateral damage as long as a straight man or straight woman can die their hair blue and call themselves queer."
372,"I feel ill reading that knowing that this abuse happens on such a large scale. I just can't. Hope the girl gets to be herself at a certain point, become at peace with herself and not be part of the statistic people are so desperately trying to ignore."
373,"This tweet breaks my fucking heart, and word for word it could have been written by me, because our experiences are almost identical. I can't believe that so many doctors and fucking *psychologists* push for this nonsense, instead of oh I don't know, maybe talking about why we're uncomfortable with our bodies and helping us with that. Because lopping off our tits and causing other permanent bodily harm is never going to fix a (likely totally unrelated) mental health issue."
374,I've seen these tweets from that user before. I feel really bad for her and all the other women who were scammed into this ideology and into believing that surgery would fix their problems with their bodies.
375,And it's happening more each day.
376,Poor girl this makes me so fucking angry. So angry.
377,"To me the question: "" Is this a Women's/Feminist issue?

We have written numerous articles on Social Media platforms about the dangers of young women being sucked up into the Trans Vortex; to no avail.

With the growing probability that there will be a steady flow of detransitionors, should this be considered a Trans Community Issue.

As Colin Powell said before the war with Iraq: ""You break it you buy.""

A major voice, is the daughter of the founder of 4 Wave Now. She has started an organization for female detransitionors.

I would really like to hear other people's thoughts on the matter."
378,I feel so bad for her and her girlfriend
379,can someone explain what the fuck this subreddit even is bc i accidentally stumbled upon it and i’m very confused
380,"And we most definitely should push to hold surgeons, therapists, psychiatrists, media personalities, and pornographers accountable for their despicable actions. What they've done is akin to torture."
381,I almost can't believe it's happening. On the cusp of widespread mainstream acceptance: SWERVE! Only there's little awareness from supposedly progressive people this is a homophobic backlash from *inside the house* employing EUGENICS AND CONVERSION THERAPY. It makes me feel crazy that other people don't see this.
382,"To be fair, it isn't just towards gay men and women. Everyone is affected by this."
383,"There's a 58% chance that happens, so let's hope."
384,This is the result of not gatekeeping and not having enough therapy pre-surgery.
385,"Absolutely a feminist issue, these girls and women are female and being exploited and abused while still babies, what's feminism if it doesn't serve our daughters?"
386,"Yes, I think it's an issue which can be addressed by feminists, because  young girls are influenced by the gender roles which society imposes on them, and for many who feel they are transgender, their feelings about gender roles are part of the process of coming to think they are transgender"
387,">should this be considered a Trans Community Issue

I don't think the trans community wants them. I think they're ashamed of them, and wish they'd go away.  

 

> Is this a Women's/Feminist issue? 

Absolutely, it is our job to be there for these women just like we are for any other woman who needs us."
388,"From the sidebar:

389,why tf this getting downvoted i just wanted to know pfttt
390,Approximately a third of transgenders go off the radar shortly after srs and they are not taken into account of the dreaded 41%. So that number might actually be higher than that.
391,"I guess I feel a lot of bitterness, about what went down in 2014. There were a series of meetings with representatives stakeholders of the Reproductive Justice Movement. ( PP, funders contraception and abortions.... including TMs & NBs. They were meeting together to discuss how they could be Inclusive in the language usage for OFAB Trans Spectrum persons.

The suggestion was Women & OFAB Persons. Not good enough for the OFAB TRAs, it had to be Gender Neutral across the board; which is how Women became uterus havers, menstrators, pregnant persons, gestators , birth person.

They have been actively involved in FEMALE ERASURE. The next attack was against the North American Midwives Association and the Doulas.

That whole Always Venus symbol removal was just petty and a drop in the bucket, compared to the above."
392,I think it's both gender roles and gender stereotypes. Plus the low self-esteem and selfloathing.
393,I know 😭. But some of the vitriol and invective they hurled at US makes me feel both saddened and angry.
394,Oh. Well. That is hardly found on this sub. Like at all. This is literally a twitter post that most definitely was not in a trans sub.
395,"Fwiw that 42% number came from a really sketchy study, where they simply asked transgender people “have you ever considered suicide?”."
396,"Get that but this isn't about them, they sold out females, it's about fighting against all that too. It's not easy. They
 piss me off too. No different than women who go along with pro-life to side with right wing men, but they still benefit from feminism AND legal safe abortion. Honestly my biggest fear in all this on an existential level are the newest generations of girls not ever understanding why they're oppressed, deprived of their own language and identity, only existing to serve males and other ""women"". You know those superior women who are super strong , never get pregnant and are rarely reported or prosecuted because it's she said/she said."
397,"\> the vitriol...they hurled at US makes me feel...angry  

No, not me. Most detrans people are young adults, at best. They got caught up in this stuff when they were kids. It's not their fault, someone should have protected them, there's a reason why we don't let kids make life altering decisions."
398,"I don't think it matters what platform it's from, the mods allow it."
399,"Ah okay. So everything else with transgenders, it's an exaggeration. Go to any high school, ask every kid there, have you ever contemplated suicide, now those numbers would be truly shocking. Wonder what they would make of those numbers."
400,"How many women are going to report they were raped by their roommates, in showers, lockers, shelters, if they can be charged with discrimination for doing it and of course knowing they have to face MORE TIMs in those same spaces? Imagine rape victims being forced to shower with the rapist's male friends right after. That's worth the fight for TIFs too, they're dreaming if they think they're safe from male violence."
401,"I was thinking about that myself, in light of the Vaping Crisis. But the TRAs would never allow a wait time until 21. And they would making it mandatory to see a psychologist, would be Gatekeeping.

They are moving forward ""informed consent"". Who needs those pesky doctors, whose 50 years ago predecessors heavly stretched out the process of Transition."
402,"FYI, this person claims to be 15-years old. It's only a matter of time before we see the first trans Elliot Rodger IMO."
403,"Uh, Malcolm X never beat people to death..."
404,"Talks about violently beating women to death while torturing them and their families.

Accuses GC women of lacking a conscience.....

Good thing I got the industrial strength irony meter, it's powerful enough to withstand these high levels of iron...nope, it exploded, that's the third one this week."
405,"If you want to go out and kill all the men that have murdered trans women, we won't stop you. Something tells me those aren't the ""transphobes"" they're gonna go after though."
406,And they wonder why we don't want to pull down our pants in the stall next to them.  The last thing any women needs to be hobbled by having to run and pull her pants up while she tries to get away from that psycho.
407,"What's most terrifying is their definition of ""transphobes"" often includes: 

* Someone who accidentally misgenders them.
* Someone who doesn't want to have sex with them.
* Someone who doesn't want a male healthcare worker touching their genitals due to abuse by males.
* Someone who is fleeing an abusive relationship with a male and doesn't want to share a bunk with a male.
* A child who accidentally refers to someone as ""him"" because they don't know what trans is.  
* A child who is confused why there is a man asking about tampons in the female bathroom.  

Can you imagine if all there people got the treatment in the writing?"
408,But you said someone born with XY chromosomes is a biological male?? Literal violence!!!!!! /s
409,It never ceases to amaze me that they think this kind of behavior is okay and that they think this kind of rage filled entitlement won’t just reaffirm that this guy is a dangerous man who feels like he could kill someone for telling him no. They constantly deny that they don’t say these things and somehow we’re the scary ones? Woe is man. Why would he think this kind of (literal) psychotic behavior would elicit any kind of empathy. If he wants to be violent like that in real life he can have fun in jail away from the general public.
410,This person seriously needs to be reported to the police. It looks like Reddit? Did you report it to the admins?
411,"Speaking as an official member of the Malcolm X fan club, this is appalling."
412,"This just drips with powerlessness and fear; seething, impotent rage.  The fantasies of a self-absorbed adolescent consumed with self-loathing.  

A cornered, panicked dog with teeth snapping at the ""bad guy it's okay to hate"" presented to him on a silver platter by TRA culture. 

Kid needs therapy.  With any luck he'll live to look back on this and cringe hard."
413,why do i get the impression they mean rude women not male murderers when they say transphobes?
414,"Once again you equate being told that you're not a woman, with systemic oppression of black people. Also, Malcolm X didn't torture people to death."
415,"I honestly couldn’t even finish reading this, what the actual fuck. Never in my life have I even read a fictional story as concerning and disgusting as that."
416,">We need a Malcolm X.

Oh fuck off."
417,He probably can't even order a pizza without shaking
418,Yet we’re supposedly the violent ones lol.
419,Now WHY on earth would a heartless woman deny this person access into a public all-ages Female shower/changing room....?
420,And then people wonder why I conceal carry. I don't trust these violent freaks for a minute.
421,mmm not very ladylike.
422,Clearly this person knows nothing about Malcolm X..
423,They wonder why people say they’re mentally ill...
424,but don't you understand?? They're fucking like super duper oppressed because when they try and force other people to participate in their worldview it's violence of they don't so we should kill all the non believers because that's violence
425,"This person needs a padded cell.  
Ah yes, so very oppressed because people who are oppressed can broadcast to the world on social media about how they want to literally torture their ""oppressors"" to death. Mhm. Yep. Thats what I call being oppressed."
426,I'd like to see them try
427,"Every person has aggressive feelings and thoughts every now and then, but that’s just not normal or even remotely sane."
428,Wasn't one of the recent school shooters nb or something?
429,Lol there was a push claiming he was a TW among trans true crime fans for a while. Freaks.
430,"With any luck, this kid will grow out of his rapid onset GD and look back on this as “wow I was fucking dumb”"
431,You gotta love the casual racism of this in addition to the breathtaking misogyny.
432,No. It's not. They are after women who are trying to protect our spaces and rights.
433,Or any little girl! This is why I'm putting my kindergartener in martial arts this year.
434,"I'm pretty sure the idiot who called me a ""transphobe"" yesterday was referring to posts where I supported women talking to women about things that affect women, without a male-bodied chaperone present to make sure that the women learn how to woman properly."
435,"And this is kinda the distinction to me, and in a way, TRAs brought these problems on themselves. If by ""transphobe"", you mean someone who assaults, attacks, and/or murders people just for being trans, then yeah, I'm perfectly fine with their violence being met with violence or at least justice. But they've watered down the term ""transphobe"" to the point where, to them, there's no meaningful distinction between targeting trans people for murder and wanting to discuss inconsistencies in their narrative."
436,Looks like they've taken the post down
437,They say they live in Korea
438,"> powerlessness and fear; seething, impotent rage

440,"Okay why would anyone WANT a literal mass murderer to be part of their demographic? Every time I see a female murderer, I’m not thinking, “Oh, cool, she’s one of us!”"
441,"If he hadn't died I'm pretty sure he'd be trans now, considering the thought evolution of a lot of these incels.  

1. hate self
2. hate females
3. become female"
442,"Yeah I’ve also been called a transphobe for that reason and for supporting women’s rights. 
I don’t want trans people to come to any harm and I certainly don’t wish them any violence, but trans rights activists would class me as a transphobe and the lovely person in this pic has made it clear what they’d do to us!"
443,"I mean if OP represents TRAs, don’t we have a pretty good reason to be afraid of them?"
444,"I reported it for threatening violence. Probably wasn’t the only one. It’s either that or TERF-crusher (tm) couldn’t handle the ""dude, this isn’t cool"" comments."
445,who wants to bet creepy white guy that teaches English in Asia?
446,"interesting to note that- like most female criminals- the shooter in question had an older male partner in crime and was mentally ill, but is still the focus of the media coverage"
447,"RIGHT?? It's madness, sheer insanity."
448,🛎🛎🛎
449,We want to be women without ever having to deal with the downsides.
450,"But why? Unless they are going into a bathroom or a change room (in which case they should be using the one that corresponds with their sex), I can't think of why they would have to constantly be on guard like that. Most people in public don't give a rat's ass about what you are wearing, as long as you aren't bothering them. Oh wait, it's because they always play the victim card to make everyone think that they are the most oppressed people on the planet."

457,"It's Black Trans women who are getting killed. This is an intracommunty problem.

462,"Yeah, not jews during the 60s, Muslims in war torn countries, not native americans or native australians during the colonial era.

Just no one can compare to what the fetish boys go through"
463,All you need is a hole to be a woman... any hole really - it's the exact same thing as having a vagina and clearly anyone who wants to have sex with women would be satisfied by it. Because people who are sexually attracted to women are really just attracted to sticking their dick into a hole - any old hole.
464,"Huh. It's almost like men have sexual preferences based on biology. Shame that women aren't allowed to have them, too."
465,"These people are such hypocrites, they accuse others of being ""genital fetishists"" but don't want to have sex with other trans people. And vaginas are more than just a hole, they're not comparable to an asshole or inverted penis."
466,"The misogyny in this is so obvious. Men can be better women than women to them, but women can’t be as good as men. Also, a vagina is “just a hole”. These are literally the same things men have been for centuries, just make it woke."
467,"Lmao so it’s totally okay for them to have a “preference” or sexual orientation but no one else can? Also, gotta love the misogyny that apparently our anatomy is just a hole to be penetrated 🙄"
468,"Cool, well maybe I want to give cunnilingus. That requires female genitalia. You could not pay me to stick my tongue to a surgical hole that may or may not be leaking colon fluid and definitely has a microbiome that I don't want in my mouth."
469,"The thing is, people who love women also love the way women react and feel. Vagina and vulva have a lots of nerves, clitoris is incredibly sensitive, vagina is covered with muscle tissue and is capable of contracting and it self-lubricates etc etc, so how can they truly honestly think a surgery hole is the same thing or feels even remotely the same for it’s carrier? And how can they simultaniosly understand that a penis is indeed a unique organ which cannot be replaced by make-believe and surgery (at least if one cares for one’s partner)?"
470,"Well, of course! If one by any chance can’t use their own vagina they can easily replace it with a tube filled with paper towels! 

How fun it is doing crafts! And having no idea what genitals look, feel or do."
471,They’re fucking hypocrites but they’ll call real women and men bigots for not wanting to date them. SMH!
472,This is classic. No self-awareness whatsoever.
473,it's so male to think that your own preferences are just inherent and natural
474,"Looking back, I wonder if this argument would have worked with my friend Steve the day his girlfriend broke up with him? ""If ya just need a hole, Steve, I might be able to accommodate ya...?"
475,They are so painfully oblivious. It’s so sad

477,FUCKING WOOOOOOOOOOOOW
478,What?  You mean genitals DO matter to sexual orientation?
479,"Meanwhile they tell lesbians who don't want their dicks it's not different than a strap on, so go suck a strap on dick."
480,Only men are allowed preferences :))))))
481,Nah a vagina isn't easy to substitute either. Only a gross man would think any hole is the same thing.
482,[removed]
483,LOL!
484,"Men don't care, they think vaginas just exist to put dicks in. So anything they can put their dick in is the same as a vagina to them."
485,"To be fair, his only criteria for being good at being a man or woman seems to be the ability to have penetrative sex."
486,Lol ewwww
487,this!! they only see what they want as rational. everything else is some sort of diversion.
488,"Try posting this there, I dare you."
489,"yeah and it's fine to have dating preferences. the problem here is that the mtf has decided their ""hole"" should be enough for a potential sexual partner, even if that partner is only into females, but won't extend that 'logic' to ftms. the hypocrisy and disrespect to vaginas is the problem, not the dating.."
490,"So you’re a heterosexual (or bisexual) man dating a woman.

The man in the OP appears to be homosexual, because he likes men and doesn’t understand the first thing about vaginas."
491,lmao
492,[removed]
493,"This is how almost all men think, and that's why their more sexually deviant and are obsessed with taboo. They don't care what their dick goes in, if it's warm tight and wet they see it as a vagina even if that ""vagina"" has literal fucking shit in it."

499,"Hmmm last time I checked it was TIMs and TRA’s disrespecting myself and other black women/WOC, and throwing racist charged slurs at us for daring to speak out against their bullshit. They always have to lie don’t they?"
500,The appropriation by TIMs of the struggles of black women in the USA never ceases to disgust me.
501,"Marsha P Johnson was a gay man, stop lying."
502,"For a sec I thought that it was the other way around, since TRAs are so fucking racist, especially to black women."
503,"Black girls didn't exist as a community until TIM's gave it to them, all hail male supremacy."
504,TiMs use black women to further their agenda without a concern as to what black women actually think and feel.

I love these posts. These individuals seem to believe that the world came into existence when they were born. So, lemme get this straight: befire TIMs there was no community of women? No churches, sororities, convents, families, book groups, nothing? Til these ignorant, self-absorbed jackasses showed up? I'll tell all my female friends that. I""m sure we had no idea."

These mofos will spend 99% of their time bitching about access to hormones and being ""misgendered"" but the second they are criticized? They are all about some black transes. Only give lip service to black maternal mortality rates and such when it pops up in their social media feed."
517,"Xhe definitely wouldn't say that to a black terf. Also this didn't happen lmao. Apparently in 2019 we're just making shit up now. 

Also, by pretend a drag queen ""gave us our rights"" erases the hard work done by lesbians and gay men far before stonewall. The fucking bubble these people live in to think that gay people didn't even exist before stonewall in America... the homophobia is far too much"
518,"Liberal feminists love to perform racism by ""uplifting"" racist white women and preaching about ~growth and change and learning~ while conveniently ignoring the lived experiences of and similarities between women of color and themselves. A white person's potential superiority (whether they're trans, male, or not) is way more important to them than any woman of color's life or thoughts about her experiences. They also love to obscure the fact that many, many radical feminists are women of color, which is why you get dumb shit like this Tumblr post."

They do it women because they’re gross predatory men."
553,"Everyone has the right to call a halt to sex at any point. Everyone. 

Lesbians are lesbians because they're into women who have vaginas. Women don't have penises, so of course, lesbians would be completely put off by a man.

Women also have the right to defend themselves if they are subject to un-wanted sexual attention, especially in their own homes. No one is allowed to predate on women's bodies, no matter how entitled they think they are.  'Stealthing' someone into sex is rape. Full stop."

It is caused by the lies that a delusional person decided to partake in, not by anti-gay hate."
570,"Even other trans people were saying that OP is advocating for rape.  OP is basically asking to erase all the progress we've made on consent, and I'm glad people are able to prioritize that over someone's feelings."
571,Ditto. Women are their enemy because they want to be us
572,"I feel so privileged, as a cis panic person"
573,"I completely cede the point. I was thinking in terms of the ""trans panic"" defence (as op was alluding to) which is often justified in the same terms as gay panic i.e. ""well he touched a guy, he's gay now!"" and thus homophobic. But yes, being angry that someone lied to you to that extent (often in the knowledge that had they not lied, you wouldn't consent) is, while imo not an excuse for murder, very much understandable"

585,There pretended to care?
586,I think some trans people are legit but it's weird how many MTF are still soo extremely male with their violent fantasies

588,"I'm not proud to be a transphobe or anything, it's just what I am."
589,The reason why they want to harm us is predominantly because we know what they are all about.
590,200+ men proudly saying they think women who say no to them should be beheaded.
591,"I personally know the usernames of both the OPs, yes, but I'm nervous to spread that info. I'm not clear on doxxing rules but I've been yelled at for not censoring usernames before.

Edit - also to be clear I have reported both of them, yes."
592,"I'm feeling pretty desensitized to their gun memes at this point, it's like a constant stream of death/rape threats"
593,Gun meme?
594,"Mods of that sub removed the post and flaired it with something like, ""let's not"" or ""please stop"""
595,"yeah I’m pretty sure a lot of FtMs are perfectly fine, it’s just that group of transtrender/tucute/anime-obsessed MtFs that are problematic"
596,"What, you think fragile masculinity isn't dangerous?"
597,"I think so, too. Because average joe and jane who mean well but know nothing about the subject think 'poor TIMS. live and let live' without any sort of critical thinking of what's actually going on. It's not live and let live - it's live and let men push women to the back again."
598,"Or simply not believing that they’re cute little teen girls. You must fully accept, in your heart of hearts...or else!"
599,No need to doxx them with us because that is ban-worthy offense.. just keep a track
600,The moderators did the bare minimum to prevent the admins from telling them off.
601,Oh yeah 100%
602,I absolutely believe if they could make the choice between millions of women and children being raped and abused and transwomen being validated -- they would choose validation. Women need to wake the fuck up and realize these people are not allies and feminists.
603,Yes because our clothes prove we are women 🤨
604,What a fucking ghoul.
605,"So she's right then, she can't trust you."
606,"Don’t get me wrong, I feel horrified for that poor vulnerable child in that morons care,but I couldn’t help laughing at the thought of some 6’9 hulking brute in what he thinks is “ girly” attire."
607,"Please tell me this is a troll, please.

That poor fucking child. Oh god."
608,Imagine being in foster care and having to be adopted into that situation😭
609,"So they've put a vulnerable little girl who has been sexually abused by dudes into a ""home"" with a sexually-dysfunctional dude who has severe psychosexual issues, a disordered misogynistic view of women, overwhelming issues with the very idea of females having boundaries, and a overweaning sense of entitlement - WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG????  


Seriously, what the ACTUAL FUCK??"
610,"""IDC if you've been abused by men all your life and are completely frightened of them!! I paint my nails and crossdress to hook up with men!!! I am better than them and I going to scare you even more and make you more terrified of men by being verbally abusive!!!!!! TRAMNDS RIGHTSSS TRAMS RIGHTTS!!!!""

611,"...6'9, built like a football player and wonders why a girl would be physically afraid and distrustful of men? 

Is this narcissistic asshole for real? Does he not hear himself over all that pained whining of dysphoria?"
612,"*Look at my closet?* What the FUCK could be in someone's closet that indicates their sex? Unless you're working on harmful sex based stereotypes?

My aunt prefers plain t shirts and baggy jeans. It must be so confusing to her when she opens her closet and can't tell whether she is a man or a woman."
613,"This man should *not* be a foster parent. FFS imagine being such a narcissistic asshole that you make someone else's trauma (a little girl's, nonetheless) *all about you.* This girl is right not to trust him, he's clearly unhinged."
614,[deleted]
615,"To clarify: I don't think that trans people make poor foster parents by virtue of being trans. I think the behavior exhibited by this individual is reprehensible, though. They are invalidating this poor girl's feelings. She is not even old enough to understand everything about biological sex but is old enough to know it can be used to hurt her, and this person would rather have her question and doubt her own lived experiences than act in a way that causes them dysphoria. Unbelievable."
616,What a selfish asshole.
617,"That girl has a gut feeling and fuck she needs to get out of there. There was a case in Australia where a foster child was raped by the brother and father and then then killed her.   
  
That trans dickhead is a narcissistic piece of shit. I’m glad he will never pass and will always be called a man for the rest of his life."
618,"How long before he attacks her and throws her acrossed the room or something and then cries dYsPhOrIa as a justification? Maybe he can cry she's a terf to the social worker who comes to investigate and get away with it!

619,"I sincerely hope that this is some more absolute BS they’ve made up but with childcare & protection services in the U.K. (yet alone other places) who fucking knows at this point. 

Vulnerable kids need stable, loving families- and more background checks should be done to prevent this kind of stuff. Thinking this alone shows motive that someone could actually do it and traumatise a child further."
620,"If this is real, it's fucking terrifying. They're already admitting to psychologically abusing and manipulating this poor foster child into denying basic reality. This is likely to escalate, and this man is clearly unhinged."
621,holy fuck i have achieved UltraPeak
622,the definition of selfish right here. expecting a traumatized child to accomodate your fetish
623,"Then why the fuck would you be a foster parent?!  Holy shit, this is disturbing."
624,"I wonder if he could become her next abuser? The hole she could paint my nails, can be intimate ritual. 

She's nothing but a paycheck for him. The reason he's closeted is because he would be judged as unfit to be a Foster parent."
625,This is absolutely horrific. This person shouldn’t be around children
626,Any calling CPS? Get that wise young girl out of there before he hurts her.
627,"sounds like that young girl has every right to be wary of him. yes children should be taught about accepting gender non conformity, but he is obviously only playing dress up. she most likely is scared because he probably acts similarly to her old abuser, but doesn’t have ALL the signs, and that’s super confusing for a child to try and figure out what is good about people and what is bad. she should be put in a different home"
628,This is so sad what the fuck.
629,"> ""Go look in my goddamn closet""

holy shit."
630,"You can ask them straight up, they will tell you that they will choose validation."
631,The clothes make the man ;)
632,"Right! I'm like, oh!!! You have dresses in your closet. That clearly makes you something other than a 6'9"" male penis haver. My mistake!"
633,[deleted]
634,"He's literally the stuff of nightmares. This poor, traumatised foster child. No young girl makes comments like that unless she's already experienced a bunch of shit at the hands of men.

He's playing the victim when he's the parent to *a foster child*. You are not the victim here! She is the victim! It's about her! Not your gender feels and secret dresses in your fucking closet you deranged imbecile. I wish I knew where he was so I could report him."
635,"I have one at work who invades the woman's bathroom of course and he is a sight to behold as my dad used to say. He actually wears sheer black Doris Day type negligee robes over his black lace gowns instead of regular sweaters. Then he sports at least size 13 2 inch heeled black fuzzy slipper pumps. It is written in the dress code that pajamas are not to be worn at work but dude gets away with it every time. HR does nothing because they consider themselves woke. They have sent younger college age kids home for wearing flannel pajama bottoms.  It's a captioning call center for the hearing impaired that employs about 400 people of different ages shapes,sizes and races. He's an old white guy in his 50's no less and checks out the women in the bathroom while making quite the show freshening his wig and make-up. It's discrimination in Bizzaro world."
636,"Honestly, with how some foster care places function, even this abusive asshole might be better."
637,“I could never molest you! I wear dresses *all the time*!”
638,"It's particularly AGPs that have a higher narcissistic inventory on average than the general population. That doesn't necessarily mean that they are narcissists proper but it is more common.

Narcissistic personality disorder has rapidly risen in the general population as well over the past decade or so."
639,[deleted]
640,"Oh, absolutely! 😁"
641,"Wow! No words! I used to work in a call center, but considerably less “woke”. It was in the hood, & he would have got his *ss beat, if he tried anything like that!"
642,"Hey you should definitely not do that, it's considered brigading and is the kind of thing that will get this sub banned by the admins. Let them upvote crazy shit, honestly it makes them look worse when stuff like this gets upvoted.



Edit: also your account can end up banned for brigading, even if the sub isn't."
643,Not here. There are a lot of TIMs working there.
644,"Oh shit, for real? I thought it was only brigading if you have multiple people do it all at once. Thanks for the heads up. I'll avoid it in the future."
645,"Not a lot of blacks, I’m guessing. Unless they’re Tims. Lol."
646,Lots of blacks. It's Milwaukee. No black TIMs though at least where I work. Plenty in Milwaukee however.
647,"Lol. Wow. They must be a new breed in Milwaukee ! In detroit somebody’s husband, baby daddy or cousin would be waiting for that dude when he got off work! Is the trans ideology that strong there?"
648,"You’ve scared me now! This is like that science fiction movie, They Live! Right now we’re able to see the scary monster,  while others are blinded into seeing frolicking puppies & sweet old ladies."
649,To some degree yes. There are lots of transvestites cross dressers and female impersonators who are not women and don't want to be female in that sense. They like their junk just where and as it is. But yes the TIM'S and (TIF's to a smaller degree) are taking over and shoving their agenda on everyone. The whole pronoun crap and cis bs is very prevalent. I have a gay male friend who made comment to me that he is kind of tired of having to inform TIFs in the club's that he's not interested in them. He feels bad that he has to hurt their feelings because he prefers men with penises. Particularly tall black men with penises. He has a type as many of us do but all of them have a penis in common. Sorry ladies and white guys.
650,"The other thing I wanted to say no offense is it's a myth I bet even in Detroit that anyones ""baby daddy"" would beat up a TIM minding their own business. Also 6'9"" TIMS are 6'9"" really big men who usually know how to fight back. I'd be thinkin twice before picking a fight if I were a guy. Also the crime statistics don't support your statement. Not saying TIMs dont get beat up but it's usually because they are in the sex or drug trade or both. Thousands more women in these trades get beat up or killed and nobody bats an eye. 18 TIMs die and youd think it was pandemic. Yeesh. Proves women just don't matter."
651,"You want some really scary nightmare reading, read the OSHA, United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines guide for transgender restroom access for businesses. Women lose and were never considered as important beings. Men in dresses and bad makeup are to be not only allowed in women's bathrooms but encouraged to use women's bathrooms cuz they are ever so much more important and sensitive. I have problems with linking on my phone but all you  need do is Google OSHA trans policy. I don't believe Congress ever had a chance to vote on it and HRC (Human Rights Coalition) wrote the recommendations. Glad I stopped donating to HRC a decade or so ago. Very misogynist organization. Needs to stop backing predatory TIMs and start supporting women and lesbians since we don't have penises. Never will have penises and men with penises hurt us and think they are entitled to our ""safe spaces"". Proud TERF here."
652,"I never meant someone minding his own business. Just the mast guy, acting out in the call center. You guys have taught me a lot though. I guess Rowling’s was right ! This is not a drill!"
653,"There is nothing feminine about products for your bleeding uterus. You know, the organ only females have. Nothing feminine about that at all."
654,Right right bleeding from your uterus because you’re not pregnant is totally a gender neutral experience
655,"Quick girl, apologize for the wrongthink!"
656,It’s literally the name of the category of products. You can’t cancel people for calling something by its manufacturing title.
657,"Does anyone actually get genuine dysphoria by using a product with ""feminine"" as a description? I use ""men's"" deodorant and men's boxers, should the company change their labeling because women also wear boxers? They're just products. If menstruation itself gives them dysphoria then the packaging of the product isn't gonna help that."
658,"Not on topic, but the second girl tweeting is so right. Menstrual products should be a right wtf"
659,"It makes me so frustrated that people are choosing to nitpick the verbiage, rather than the content, of what she is actually saying."
660,"I’m a woman, only women get them, I don’t need to debate the “feminine” aspect of it, innately it belongs to females.  I identify it with strength, the ability to hold meticulously selected, generations-old, genetic information, to give as a gift to another?? Powerful/ godly.  Which, I suppose, is synonymous with the feminine anyways."
661,This reminds me of my male cousin who used to always have an OB tampon on his person 'in case he got shot and needed to stop the bleeding.'  (Really to impress women.)  Why else would a man be carrying tampons?
662,"where do they think the word feminine derived from?  it literally means of or relating to females so periods, tampons, pads, etc. could not be more feminine.  it is inherently female & feminine"
663,I think it's more about policing women.
664,"Because using men's products you know you are a Woman. They, using feminine products have to keep up the illusion they are women. 

See someone who is real deep in delusion(there are levels) if they believe they are Napoleon for example nothing you say is going to change that.Thats someone in deep.

 But, if they want to be Napoleon and know they aren't and desperately want to keep that illusion, anything that breaks it threatens it.

They may even resent and hate you because you remind them they are not Napoleon and/or you tell them they aren't and can never be Napoleon. 

And if they could meet Napoleon himself, on the one hand they would admire him on the other hand they may hate and resent him because he is the real deal."
665,Absolutely. You steal a pack of tampons or pads I don’t see it.
666,"Essentially, being a woman isn’t feminine. Being *like* one totally is though."
667,"Because the language that advertisers have used since the 70s is ""Feminine Protections"" product as opposed to highlighting Periods = blood. Even as the language evolved the FP was still used to highlight protection from ""heavy flow.""

Then they got hip to the reality that over the course of a period, there can be different flow rate. So they used different pastel colored packages for pad and tampon colors. It was like a monthly Easter Basket."
668,"But isn't it usually transmen who say this? I'm not saying your response isn't true, but why police women if they have always been women? Either that or it is transwomen that are saying this."
669,🙌🙌🙌
670,And then they come and tell radfems that we only accept women who look and are feminine and female
671,"I always thought it was transwomen and ""allies"" arguing for arguments sake. I guess I'm not entirely sure it just seems like one of those ""what about-isms"" that has no basis in reality."
672,"I knew one TIF I could totally see jumping on the bandwagon, but the bandwagon would have started with TIMs."
673,Ah that's probably it. Seems a lot of time spent looking for and complaining about things that never are actual problems.
674,I’m so tired of these racist assholes.
675,"Woke libfems refuse to call out racist privileged men like this.  It's so progressive for white men in dresses to talk down to black females.  (I guess it queers racism?)  I'd encourage them to read on the medical experiments carried out on black women throughout American history by doctors who seem to magically know they were female somehow.  A TiM recently told my girlfriend (parents from Nigeria) that she was a, ""t*** giving into the Master."""
676,What the actual fuck. Love her reply though.
677,"Fucking evil fuck. Imagine being this racist and out of touch with reality. 

All these assholes are privileged white men who want to cosplay as women. They need to stop using POC as a point for their shitty arguments."
678,They're not even trying to hide their racism.
679,"I studied anthropology for a bit and I never came across any reference to anyone thinking non white women weren't women. The closest thing was probably the colonisers in Tasmania saying they didn't know how the natives reproduced because they were so ugly or something similarly nasty. 

The only place I've heard of people not being called *real women* is in Arab sources about western women, and that comes up sometimes recently as well. That's because women in their culture have very strict boundaries if behaviour they have to fit between and can be made ""not real women"" in their own society if they step outside them. It's a method of controlling people you are actually quite sure are female."
680,Woooow
681,"If they don't know who's female, how did they know whose rights were up for debate?"
682,Fuck these dudes.
683,"Not often that my jaw drops reading something, but it sure did there."
684,"I like their equivocation of population biodiversity with sexual dimorphism.  These guys have never read Cavalli-Sforza.  The *traits* where Khoisan women differ from Nepalese women are completely unrelated to the points where AGP TIMs differ from women.  No ethnic group has women that had the MRI results of a heterosexual man.  

Ever notice that AGPs love using crap logic that would be dismantled in a Philosophy 101 class?

Dave Muscato uses composition fallacies like ""a woman can be infertile and have PCOS and lose her hair and be exclusively gynephilic and still be a woman, therefore I'm a woman.""  Never mind the incel rants Dave was posting in 2009 about how women were ""shallow"" and didn't want him.  See also:

* ""It's my penis and I'm a woman, therefore it's a feminine penis."" 

*  ""Cis women are more aroused by the thought of looking good, therefore masturbating in my [sister's | daughter's] panties means I'm a woman.  Checkmate Blanchard!""

* ""Some traditional cultures have a third gender for HSTS and GNC gay men, therefore a gynephilic man crossdressing is just continuing a tradition.""

*  Logic from \/r/MtF when Nicole the Pedo met a linebacker with obvious autogynephilia: ""Cis men like JoeySalads wearing a dress to make a point are bad, but lack of dysphoria and no attempt to look like a woman doesn't make someone any less valid than the most passing trans woman.""

* ""Women, what would you do differently if all men had a 9 pm curfew?  Also, looking exactly like a man doesn't make me any less of a woman.""  --Dave Muscato

* ""I'm nonbinary and identify as neither a man nor a woman.  Therefore, I belong in the women's bathroom even though I have five o'clock shadow.""  --Mx Nillin"
685,I've been fighting this kind of Racist shit since I joined Tumblr which was almost 5 years ago. Reddit 2yrs +.
686,"I wish they’d redirect their bullying and harassment towards straight men instead, but I’m sure that they know exactly what will happen to their movement if they do."
687,"WHAT THE HELL!

That is so rude I can't even think of a reply to that!"
688,"""What the actual fuck"" was also my first thought upon reading."
689,A lot of dentists would be enriched?
690,"Lmao, that’s a good one.

But yeah, I was implying that their movement would be exposed and they’d lose all credibility and become a joke to the media.  We all know how much power men have (especially straight, white ones)."
691,"This close to awakening.


IF every person in the world, who had something in their body that they detested (or just wished it was like other's bodies)*, focused on that part, on changing it, on modifying it so that others would see what they wanted, a lot of people would need intensive mental health care, or they'd commit suicide.


* Specially women and girls -  human females."
692,"Dude, the clarity."
693,r/selfawarewolves
694,"It's not like anyone is saying he has to call himself ""man"" though, just call yourself a transwoman (all one word) and stop claiming to actually be a woman (because you're right, you're not. You feel like you're invading their space because that's exactly what you are doing.) But if you stop doing that and just live your life as a transwoman pretty much no one will care."
695,Self-awareness is good. Maybe he'll stop before it's too late.
696,Good. He should feel like shit.
697,Hey well at least he has enough self awareness to admit it... That's... Something...
698,Almost self-aware. Almost.
699,"Thank you, whoever you are"
700,But think of how wealthy the doctors and surgeons would be.
701,I doubt it. He probably got a hundred comments telling him he’s not doing anything wrong.
702,Seriously.  I feel bad for the women he no doubt scared the shit out of in that bathroom.
703,[removed]
704,Yes we can understand men prioritizing their comfort and feelings over that of women.  We literally see it on a daily basis.
705,"For the supposed ""sex and gender are different"" crowd they sure do use the two to mean the same thing a lot"
706,"sex at birth is recorded, not 'assigned.'"
707,"Meme or not, this is becoming a pervasive sentiment. Evaluate your Lived Experiences through the gender fandom's filter: if growing up as a girl, as the target of all that girl-children are subject to by society, is rough, maybe the problem is that you just aren't really a girl on the inside - and you can opt out :)"
708,"Bruh what I STILL struggle with enjoying being born a woman, I fucking hate it. I'd flip the switch and become a guy aNNyyyy day of the week. Fuck you mean ""being happy"" with ur assigned gender. Also the amount of trans people I've met who say they're happy being born trans is unbelievable, so I guess theres those in the trans community who are happy with what they were born as too only so they could transition."
709,"i hate being a man, it’s a miserable existence and any time is reminded of my maleness it ruins my day, but i’m smart enough to know no amount of surgery and hormones will make me not a man. i just have to live with it"
710,It’s literally a meme
711,"Having 2 synonyms for ""the state of being male or female"" was a mistake"
712,"They know you can't, and trans man are barely mentioned anywhere, because well, you know, they are... Oh."
713,The comments on it claim otherwise
714,"Oh but you just declare ""I'm not a girl, sweaty, I'm an enby"" and it all works out...right? Every feeling can be a gender.

(I know this is quite old but I only get to check this account sporadically, my bad.)"
715,This isn’t showing the comments though?
716,"I can't show all the comments otherwise the screenshot would be too long and small to read easily, otherwise I would include them. If you want to read them though you can find them with little effort if you look for the post."
717,I feel a little bad about laughing but this story is just so melodramatic and hilarious
718,"So I assume this person is in HS? Which means, they're at that peak stage where everything is just at a crescendo of over the top drama from this telling... Which means embellishments. And lots of them. 

This just further makes me think that this TRA stuff is making insecure teenagers utterly miserable and anxious for zero reason."
719,Why does all tims writes that they just wish to wear dresses and put chapsticks? And act like some random dramatic idiot out of teenage movies?
720,This is simply pitiful.
721,"Why co-op International Women's Day? It a day to celebrate each other and our endeavors. It's also way to celebrate all our Sheroes, individually and collectively.

I don't know what's worse: calling themselves lesbians or thinking that this day is at ALL about them."
722,These men think they could handle actually being a woman they’re so funny
723,"For international women's day, OP:

- Made the day about himself
- Got upset that nobody was paying attention to him
- Threw a temper tantrum when nobody coddled him after he cried
- Was passive aggressive to his female friends who support him and give him lifts home from class, and gave them the silent treatment
- Told his mum to shut the fuck up
- Is threatening to call the police on his mum:

> My mum is trash. I'll file a police report against her if she keeps being transphobic. She just ssid some of the most transphobic shit this morning


What's new? All men are the same"
724,"I hope this kid grows up one day because this is pathetic. His poor parents must be dumbfounded with it all.

The life of a woman is not like a fucking rom-com you porn addled moron."
725,Fan fiction. Never happened. Probably some old white guy.
726,Men are the most fragile little Narcissists in existence.
727,I remember in 2nd grade when Harvey I forget his last name peed through his jeans because he couldn't get the eraser from the top of his pencil out of his ear.
728,"No one wished me anything in women's day, and only now I learned that I could have cried all day because of it. Damn it. /s"
729,Nope. They're not in HS which I think makes this even worse. They're 19 and taking one paid cooking course
730,"Since when is chapstick female-only? That's such a weird thing to grasp onto, most men in my life dislike having dry and chapped lips as well."
731,My thoughts exactly! They would fold instantly if they had to deal with even a fraction of what women are forced to deal with. Its hilarious they think otherwise
732,"This dissection is great. Your reddit username is amazing. However, the MTF post makes me cringe and vomit in my mouth."
733,"Imagine that poor woman dealing with this idiot and supporting his worthless ass, so he can cry about how terrible she is online. Get a job and move out, Charlie."
734,Found the incel
735,"Oh, then yeah. That is far too old to be acting like this. I swear from the text they sound sixteen or so."
736,I think the same as you
737,Like if being excluded from a photo invalidates your whole sense of being a woman I wonder what they think we deal with when we have to experience... ya know... *real problems* like sexism and misogyny from men like them?
738,Don't forget that young men mature more slowly than young women. He's basically fetishizing being a younger teenage girl. Gross.
739,"Can you imagined if he somehow turned into a bio woman and got talked over and ignored, just to have a man stole all the ideas when he tried to tell the group about them. Him getting catcalled, or getting the evil eye from strangers and feeling that rush of fear go through his system? I think he would have a complete mental breakdown just after one day."
740,"If you stick your dick in my stall, I'm taking the scissors and cut if off.

It's that simple."
741,"Yes, that's JUST what all the laydees are crying out for, Sir - which of ""us girls"" \*hasn't\* been sat peeing and thought, gosh, I wish a random stranger's penis would come through the stall door......  :/"

744,"‘Just let us into the bathroom, all we want to do is pee!’"
745,Why the fuck would we want glory holes?! Why would we want a random penis interrupting is while we pee? That's sexual assault! I fucking hate these people.
746,As if unsolicited dick pics weren't enough
747,"I was going to ask ""for whose penis to enter?"" and then I remembered"
748,"Sure, but only if each stall has a tiny guillotine attached so when the penis is unwanted (always) you can chop it off."
749,"But...but I thought the poor disenfranchised trans ladies only wanted to pee, privately, like ladies, in the ladies' room"
750,You stick that thing through a stall door I'm in? you're going to lose it. Choppity chop.
751,"This is why I carry a tactical knife, I can slice off any ""surprise"" dick. Shazam, Julienned."

755,god DAMMIT!!! this one is PARTICULARLY FUCKING EGREGIOUS
756,"Just makes peeping at the little girls in the next that much easier!

Pedophile workshop, right there in that posted comment. Hey, next their ask to have the doors removed from the stalls!"
757,Most women carry a knife and they're gonna cut anything that comes through a hole in the bathroom stall. 🤷‍♀️
758,I will happily submit to a genitals check for bathroom usage as an alternative to this.
759,WHAT?
760,what the FUCK

808,Cancer surgeries should NOT be delayed just because some bio bitch wants to mutilate herself to achieve an impossible fantasy
809,Wow. Top surgery can be important and even life saving and someone can still have the capacity to understand the urgency of cancer over affirming cosmetic surgery. People can be so self-centered.
810,"I hate them, yes hate them. 

I had a double mastectomy about three years ago, b/c of cancer.

I was lucky, very lucky, I didn't need any other treatment.

I couldn't wait to get them off of me.


""Bio bitch"" jhc, they are hateful scum."
811,"ignoring the probably-troll bio bitch comment, it's a sign of very serious hospital mismanagement if you have to frequently cancel one long planned surgical procedure (ftm top surgery) for other less-planned but statistically predictable procedures (cancer-related double mastectomies)

ESPECIALLY considering how rare it is for one surgeon to be an expert in both. it's an entirely different skill set. do they have reconstructive/cosmetic surgeons doing tumour removals? yikes. do they have surgical oncologists doing top surgery? double yikes"
812,it's evil to be upset about having your medical procedures cancelled?
813,Yeah. I have no problem believing the person thinks that but I seriously doubt its a popular idea among trans people.
814,"if this were routinely and naturally a zero sum game id agree, but it's poor and possibly dangerous hospital mismanagement that they're substitute procedures.

the same doctors should NOT be doing top surgeries and cancer related double mastectomies. either top surgery patients are going to be fucked over because their surgeon isn't used to reconstruction and gives them a no nipples cancer chest, or cancer patients are going to be fucked over because their surgeon isn't used to dealing with cancer and doesn't remove all the tissue.

it's like if therapy appointments were being cancelled for physiotherapy. is being able to walk more important than finally crying over your childhood pet? probably. should there EVER be a situation where they're sharing resources? heck no!

also, breast cancer rates are fairly stable and any good hospital should have the capacity to predict cases per month-or-so and have resources available"
815,Welcome to social healthcare. Shits fucked.
816,"No. What *is* evil, though, is to lash out against people whose procedure is objectively way more urgent than yours."
817,"I'm referring to the comment at the bottom I'm sure you can see that. But okay having said that,as far as the surgery itself I'm sure it could be and would be rescheduled. It's not permanent. Second, maybe I'm different but speaking for myself as a Woman, a Person, if that was the explanation given to me why my surgery was rescheduled I would be understanding. 


Cancer is serious and no joke. Though I may not know the people I would have enough compassion for others to understand and adjust and reschedule my surgery even if it meant choosing another physician. If you have the resources to do this surgery anyway it should not be a problem. 


The comment made shows this is more about this person feeling angry and entitled that someone would have the nerve to deny them and they don't care why. Smacks of selfishness, entitlement and lack of compassion for others. Which interestingly enough many of these people have been and are being accused of."
818,"Whether that’s all fair and true or not, the message here is very clearly “our plight is equal or greater to cancer and your cancer treatment mismanagement isn’t our problem” which is ... tone deaf, to be charitable. 

Dysphoria is hard. Being trans is hard. Not being able to get affirming treatment is hard. The sum of those parts leads to tragic suicides. But in context, having affirming treatment *delayed* to prioritize emergency cancer treatments is a no brainer and apples to oranges in degree of urgency.

But I’m just a lost little truscum, what do I know 🤷🏻‍♀️"
819,Still a shitload better than the healthcare in the US tho.
820,im not sure what you mean by that- do you mean government funded healthcare?
821,"The comment at the bottom is so obviously trolling, c'mon."
822,"I don't think the message is ""we're more important than cancer"" its ""mental health shouldn't unnecessarily take a back seat to physical health"", which is just true."
823,Like Canada or the UK. Wait times are atrocious and long held appointments get bumped regularly with no reason given.
824,"Perhaps, but there are those that do feel that way and have said it. Even if it is just words, words are telling about the thoughts behind them. Trolling is not an excuse. If it was racial let's say, very push button issue on social media ,troll joke or not, it would not have been received well. I sense you know this, and if you feel it is just a troll which excuses it in your mind why bother commenting or being defensive? It's just a troll right?"
825,"Okay, that’s being even more charitable, which is your prerogative.

But we’re not talking about a schizophrenic who is an immediate danger to themselves. We’re not talking about a mental health patient being denied intervention via therapy or medication. 

We’re talking about a mere *delay* in a procedure that is ultimately elective. For fear of the unknown quantity that is SRS trans people frequently delay or never get affirming surgeries despite the debilitating dysphoria they are suffering, and they do not make a dismissive huff about cancer patients stealing their doctors.

Again, you may be (and imo absolutely are) correct about where the real issue lies, but until that is sorted out by the administrative side of things, we’re still talking about trans patients crying that women with cancerous tumors threatening their lives *physically and imminently* are cutting in line with the available doctors,

World’s smallest violin. Dysphoria and cancer, in this context, are incomparable and it’s disingenuous to say these patients don’t feel they deserve to be as high of a priority as cancer patients. I have very bad dysphoria, I’m suicidal more days than I am not - the very thought that “okay, my date got pushed back, but I still have a date” would be more than enough to get me to hold on knowing the reason for my longer wait was to treat cancer patients.

This devil doesn’t need advocating. Go write a letter to management if they’re the cause. These trans patients are out of line under the current circumstances."
826,"I live in the UK, and uh. nope. generally not true."
827,"I mean it depends on if the troll is trans or not, clearly. Like, you wouldn't take a white person pretending to be asian online and writing anti black slurs as a representative of the asian community, right? So let's not use this obvious troll as a representative of the trans community. 

""Bio"" anything has not been a phrase used to casually refer to non-trans people in the trans community ever afaik."
828,"What would you suggest people do when their mental health treatment is neglected, cancelled, delayed or administered poorly? Just shut up about it because some people have it worse? Ideal world everyone would just be okay with everything that happens to them, but it's not an ideal world and shaming people for expressing their emotions because ""someone else has it worse"" is shitty."
829,"Really? So my daughters neurology appointment didn't just get pushed back *again* for the third month in a row?

I guess a 6 month old having 10+ siezures a day isn't really a problem.

Please, tell me more about how great our system is and how short the wait times are."
830,I lived in Canada for 40 years and it’s absolutely  true there. I have so many friends and family members who were forced to wait years for important surgery. A friend of my mother’s had 95% artery blockage and was forced to wait 8 weeks for heart surgery. She was told to stay in bed and do nothing in the meantime not even open a door. The only good thing about Canada healthcare is that it’s taxpayer-funded.
831,Like waiting 12 months to have CBT treatment of worse standard than  I could pay for ang get tomorrow?
832,I never said it was a representative of the Trans community. You did. And as I live in a free country I can say what I like. Apparently  it bothers you for reasons that are now clear. Good day to you .
833,"Doctor: Yes, Patient Y? I’m terribly sorry, I know this surgery is important to you, but I’ve just had a cancer patient dropped in my lap who needs an emergency mastectomy before it spreads any further.

Me: I understand, doctor. I hope everything works out for your patient. See you on [new date]

???

Is this not how a reasonable person would react? Are trans people the only ones to ever find themselves in this predicament, or just the only ones to claim civil rights violations because my feelings hurt more than her cancer does?

I’m getting increasingly snarky, and I apologize because I mean no disrespect to my fellow dysphoria sufferers, but this seems to be a much simpler inconvenience being made out to be an affront to trans rights and safety. 

Nobody is *entitled* to elective surgery. And I don’t care what arguments some trans people are making, cosmetic surgery is **always** elective and adequate therapy for gender dysphoria should be addressing the necessity for those procedures and weathering expectations throughout the process.

 Not being able to survive a week longer for the procedure you’ve waited all your life for, *to save a life from a more immediate health crisis*, isn’t mental illness. It’s narcissism."
834,"For one of my relatives with insurance, the wait time to see Neurology at an academic medical center in a large northwest US city was 6 months a year ago."
835,"it's not perfect, the NHS is suffering from austerity and needs more funding BUT it's vastly better than having to pay out of pocket and go into deep medical debt (which you can do in the UK) and its not inherent to the system"
836,"so an eight week wait that didn't kill her. how does that compare to either not getting the surgery or being in tens of thousands of debt?

the difference between for-profit and government medical systems is how limited resources are assigned

in a for profit system, the richest people can buy their surgeries immediately, people who can just about scrape or borrow the cash can get it eventually, and those that can't die

in a government medical system, people who need a heart surgery immediately get it immediately, people who can wait eight weeks safely may have to

i prefer the assignment of resources based on need, not financial privilege"
837,you can pay for CBT treatment in the UK. we have a private healthcare market.
838,"Okay so again, that should really not be the same doctor. Just mentioning that.

And I get not being particularly emotional, I'm also not, but some people just need to vent sometimes. Having a procedure delayed in that manner isn't just ""oh I have to wait another month/week/year"" it's ""I've lost the £35 I paid for my train to the hospital. I've used up my paid medical leave. My partner might not be able to help me recover in this different time frame."" It's a major disruption that it's okay to vent about.

It's also a good thing to make the public aware of, like all shitty things that can be changed with public pressure."
839,Pediatric neurology with high seizure activity? If not then it's irrelevant.
840,Its also suffering from being overstretched and quite badly organised.
841,"I'd rather be in debt than dead on a wait list.

Plus, if not insured and paying cash in the states you pay a fraction of what's on the invoice. Hospitals pump up the charges because insurance has teams dedicated to beating them down. Someone paying cash or a payment plan with no BS? They'll cut a deal.

Edit to add, if the US sucks so much (I'm in the UK by the way) why anytime there's a complex case people raise money to send the child to the USA for treatment? Maybe because of the cost involved they can afford the best people and the best research?"
842,Yea thats what I said. You can pay for top surgery too.
843,"I already conceded that point, though I have to wonder if your solution is that we plant more transition doctors this season instead of cancer doctors. In a broad sense their expertise is the same whether they’re performing a mastectomy on a trans man or a cancer patient. It is **inevitable**, under any system, that a doctor qualified for both will book a surgery for a trans patient but have to push their appointment back following unforeseen emergencies where their expertise is required.

We can understand their valid disappointment without normalizing temper tantrums or ignoring the dismissive tone in how they speak about those cancer patients.

You’ve made your points and I’ve made mine, I don’t think either of us reached our feelings on this frivolously so shall we agree to disagree?"
844,"overstretched is just another way to describe underfunding. demand is outpacing supply. increase supply.

and yeah, it's an awfully organized mess."
845,"it's because the USA healthcare system prioritizes life by wealth.

ideally the NHS would provide all healthcare, but sometimes a surgery that costs four million pounds and extends a painful life by a year just isn't possible within the current framework of horrific budget cuts

direct this energy at voting out the tories and protesting against selling off the NHS, not towards fighting for the marketization of human life"
846,"sure. agree.

but you're in a thread comparing capitalist market healthcare systems and socialized healthcare systems"
847,"Agree to disagree on most things, but I *really* need you to understand that they're only broadly the same in the sense that all surgery is broadly the same.

It shows real ignorance of female bodies to some that ""same surgery site = basically same surgery"". It's like arguing that removing a colon tumour and performing mtf SRS (well, the type that uses colon tissue) are the same because they both involve removing part of the colon. They're not. At all."
848,Giving mentally ill people surgery to pretend their mental illness is reality rather than psychiatric treatment to treat their mental illness is not helping matters though.
849,"

881,I'd like to know what it's like to have no real problems for a day.
882,"I have Lupus and take Hydroxychloroquine - two pills twice a day. This is the prescription medicine that Trump shouldn’t have mentioned as it has not fully been researched in connect with the Coronavirus.  Now patients, doctors, and hospitals are hoarding it and you can’t get it at a pharmacy anywhere in the country. One pharmacy in s Florida told a Lupus patient that it might be six months before it would be available again to people like us. 

People with Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis who need this may suffer severe inflammation and pain, joint inflammation and some immobility (for me that’s back to walking with a cane but maybe needing two canes), problems with other organs like kidneys, heart, pleurisy in the lungs (I’m describing Lupus here with which I’m familiar), memory and other cognitive problems, etc. 

Some of us will have to go on corticosteroids steroids or even stronger medication like Methotrexate or biological. These all have awful side effects. We’ll be even more likely to catch infections like the flu, pneumonia, COVID-19 and less able to mount a normal attempt at an immune response. If we become so sick with Coronavirus that we have to be hospitalized and if there is a shortage of ventilators we will not be put on one.  Even if e’re 35 years old, not 65, we’ll be sent home to die. 

So tell me again how the special people and their pursuit of their fetishistic, delusional, caricature of womanhood is more important for Newsweek to write about than the story about how many, if not most, of the under 60 chronically ill are women, natal women, because many of those  chronically ill people under 60 have autoimmune diseases - the majority of which overwhelmingly afflict women.

By staying away from the hospital for her physio due to this virus, she gets the joy of further restricted movements and spasms returning that she'll need more meds for. I can't even go to her home and comfort her and help her move about and clean, because I don't want to accidentally give her something she wouldn't be able to survive.

But hey, let's think of the most oppressed ever trans beans who are voluntarily taking HRT or having their cosmetic, voluntary surgeries postponed so that dying people can have the beds. Their needs should come first, I mean, it's only 20,000 people who have died worldwide so far."

903,"Why can't we live and let live? I'm a pansexual demigirl, Male to Female (and that does not break any of the rules on this page). And I hate Trump. And I'm not on HRT.

I'm not disrupting any hospital services, not wasting medicine, etc. So let's live and let live."
904,There are so many chronic health problems that won't wait for the pandemic to go away. I'm terrified for all people who have one of those because those are vulnerable yet still need to take the risk of getting to a doctor or even a hospital at the moment.
905,"My cousin had sudden heart problems last week before hospitals were even getting overwhelmed and *no one* was allowed to go visit her while she was there for two days. 

If you get sick, get in an accident, etc. you could very well end up dying alone in an overwhelmed hospital. 

It also made me think about pregnant women right now. They tend to get regular checkups and don't most now give birth in hospitals? I can't imagine the stress pregnant women must be feeling right now. I can't imagine being hospitalized due to cystic fibrosis complications right now. We're likely to run out of hospital beds for the sick with this virus later this week. That's not even accounting for people with other emergencies, who may also get infected in the process. 

There are so many people with ongoing health problems that we should actually be concerned about. Hormone therapy can wait."
906,Trans people would argue that without these injection they would die (by suicide)

Me though, the only people I blame are the WHO, the CCP, and the US govt. They combined allowed this to spread when they had warning as early as Jan 12 that this could be another SARS. Utterly shameful how the WHO handled it, shame on the CCP for concealing it for months, and shame on the US for doing zilch in the two months warning they had to prepare. Tedros should be fired, honestly. He is one of the main reasons we're in such dire straights now. Imagine seeing a novel coronavirus with 95% similarity to SARS reach 10,000 cases in under 2 weeks in China and not instantly realize you have to prepare and stop the spread because the thing is obviously much worse than SARS in terms of final death count. ANY idiot could've predicted this. The WHO has blood on their hands."
914,"Texas is putting off abortions b/c of this.

That is super bad."
915,"Surprisingly enough, having their hormone shots and elective surgeries postponed during the pandemic will end up not causing massing trans suicides."
916,"Thank you. My heart breaks for the thousands, maybe a hundred thousand or more elder, chronically ill, and disabled (physically and or mentally) Americans who will be left to die in a Nazi/Hitlerian act of euthanasia because Trump won’t invoke the War Defense Powers, Order the immediate manufacturing of more ventilators and won’t provide them with the massive amounts Federal dollars to do so. 

(This means that the USA is mostly unable to produce its own protective masks, gowns, goggles, etc (PPE) for frontline healthcare workers some of whom will due as as a result or infect and possibly kill their family members inadvertently). 

Governor Cuomo of New York State yesterday said that the Federal government sent New York 4,000ventilators. But they need 30,000. How, he asked, are they, the Feds, going to decide who the 26,000 will be who won’t get a ventilator and will die."
917,Because it has been the major source of contention.
918,"Are they taking advantage of the situation to ban abortion or are they just putting it off during the pandemic? 

Because even if it kinda sucks, I think doctors and clinics should focus on saving sick people rather than abortion right now. Every bed, every doctor, every nurse can save a life. So everything that is not necessary should be postponed."

920,We are in hellish tiMes. My mom is elderly and has all kinds of issues. She’s been in quarantine for a month now. And I’m the only one that goes near her. I’m terrified of getting sick and infecting her. I’m terrified if they run out of her meds. Our health system (I’m in The Netherlands btw) is a complete joke. And it took covid19 to find out. Third world countries and the refugee camps are even in a worse spot. All we can do really is hope this goes away quick and doesn’t leave a lot of damage behind. And I hate the ppl who pretend it just a flu and go out and pretend nothing is the matter. And those aren’t just young ppl either. I see lots of elderly here (primarily actually where I am at) who don’t seem to give a sh*t. Ppl just don’t seem/want to get it.
921,"Not all sex workers are trans, though, and I feel like sex workers (trans or not) really are in a more vulnerable position right now for obvious reasons. It's quite different from trans people complaining about how they're unable to get hormone shots, or having to postpone cosmetic surgeries."
922,"yes, but they could still allow medication abortions and are still encouraging people to go to church."
923,"I am so sorry to hear about your mother. It’s so hard carrying for an older parent under normal circumstances. I know. I cared for my mother. My wife helped. Then it was her mother who was ill for years at the end. I hope you stay well and keep your mother safe. 

Everything you have said about the Netherlands could be said about America and about San Francisco where I live. I feel like the people in my city who take this the most seriously are the older gay men who survived AIDS, the lesbians who took care of them, and the heterosexuals who had gay friends back then. 

Yesterday, one of America’s greatest gay playwrights died of Covid-19. Terence McNally. Normally, the tradition is for all the lights on Broadway to go dark for one night to honor such a great person of the theater. But Broadway is already dark because of COVID-19."
924,"Not getting cosmetic surgeries hasn't caused someone to die. We live in interconnected global markets. This means that there is no shortage of estrogen or testosterone in these markets. They have ample opportunities to purchase the hormones. If you think that you need these hormones or you'll die, that's a psychological perception."
925,"Medication abortions ? What is that ? Like contraceptive? 

And going to church is sooo dumb right now"

932,"I know and understand your heartbreak. I went through a trifecta: Prince, David Bowie and Chris Cornell."
933,"I have no idea who the latter is but I’m with you in the first two. I met David Bowie for a moment with my best friend back behind the Hollywood Palladium after a concert in the early 1970s. In high school I went to a dance club for teens (most of whom were LGB although maybe not aware or out).  It was called Rodney Bingenheimer’s English Disco and was in Hollywood, California. One evening I met David Bowie’s wife there. We danced and she kissed me on the lips. Closed mouth but I was around 16 so you can imagine the effect. Another night British rock star Suzy Quattro was there! Danced with her too. This was the height of glitter rock music. Rodney’s was the epicenter of the glitter rock scene in America. Thankfully, the made-up trans and many fake gender identities and letters added to gay and lesbian (as the political and social movement was called then if it wasn’t still referred to as “gay”) did not yet exist."

947,Just because none of it matters doesn't mean I think my existance is a tragedy. I like living. That doesn't mean I have to have children to be a good person. Many people who have children are horrible and don't have the patience to raise them right. I know I would be a bad parent. So I won't have kids.

>possibility of war

With who? And who cares? War is natural. ps, nothing is gonna happen.

>climate change

I wont deny it, but I will say it's been overblown for various political purposes like say, making white women not have kids, while using demographic decline to force massive third world immigration down the throats of normal people.

You arent polluting the world, the Indians and the Chinese are responsible. Prove me wrong.

>all the waste that isn't going anywhere soon

Human innovation is a constant. We can overcome.

>animals going extinct

If that's bad then why do you want to go extinct?

>sure we've improved a lot too but it seems it won't be enough 

You seem like your coming up with excuses. Have fun trying to rationalize dying Childess and alone when your 60.

I know I'm most likely wasting my time here, but on principle I will never stop. Live to see another day, bad and good times will come throughout history. Your ancestors struggled through living hell so that you could be here today, even if you are too confused and ignorant to appreciate the beauty of life, don't erase the future for the sake of your comfort."
949,"Why would having children rationalize dying? It's all irrational no matter what you do. And I don't have to die alone just because I don't have children. Having them might bring meaning to some people's lives but for me I know it would only bring constant stress and no free time of my own.

Also why would anyone need to live in misery? Just to bring someone to life that might or might not enjoy it? I would be a terrible mother. It wouldn't be righy for the kid to bring them to this world.

I do appreciate the beauty of life but that has nothing to do with having children or not having them. People aren't going to go extinct no matter what my contribution is."
950,He feels uncomfortable because he KNOWS he’s not a woman and he KNOWS “drop the T” makes logical sense.
951,"He's right, he doesn't share any experience with us. The difference is, we're actually women and he's a man cosplaying as a woman. Trans ""women"" never try to empathize with the experiences of actual women. They don't listen. They try to project their own experiences and viewpoints on what it means to be a woman and say that that is the only way to be a woman, and that if we don't go along with it we're terfs, not real women, trans men etcetcetc

There are a few HSTSs that genuinely have unbearable body dysmorphia and can't stand being in their own bodies. They try everything to pass as women and understand that they ARE men and don't try to overstep their boundaries. Those are the trans women I will actually sympathize with. But most of them aren't like that and I am NOT going to make any accommodations for them, no matter how angry they get"
952,He's right. I don't know why this simple fact - that their experiences as males who want to be female are fundamentally different than the experiences of someone born female - is such a difficult thing for the majority of them to grasp. That's why it's just ridiculous to lump women and TIMs in the same category as if we have any common denominator in this group apart from being human.
953,"Cis. Such a simple little word used by the trans lobby to eliminate our biology. 

Cis? No, biological female or biological male.

Don’t call me cis. I am not an isomer.

> The prefixes cis- and trans- are used in chemistry to describe geometric isomerism. 

> Geometric isomers occur when atoms are restricted from rotating around a bond."
954,“i hate women” but make it woke
955,"Oh of course  a TIM is allowed to say that, but if a woman points out that we have no experiences in common with transwomen she'll be witchhunted.

962,"No same physical body- check
No same lived experience- check
Personal identity- What is that?"
963,"It was in a comment, not the original post: “cis people are the same as everybody else where some are amazing fluff balls who deserve the world and some simply aren’t.” Big of him to say we don’t all deserve death."
964,">Personal identity- What is that?

Self-perception. A healthy ego is a normal part of our core psyche that we all have. How we perceive ourselves (""I'm this, and not that"") is what allows each of us to hold a cohesive sense of self.

For trans people, obviously part of their personal identity is gender. I'm not suggesting whether that's healthy or not, but it just is."
965,"That's a good answer. It's kind of a BDD view on trans identity, if they perceive themselves as a gender that they have neither of the other two things in common with. It's true that they have a gender identity, given that the other two criteria don't match up, I wonder if they're dealing with a lot of cognitive dissonance."
966,"I'm sure it varies quite a bit, but I think seeking constant validation is a symptom of cognitive dissonance. Some trans people seem to be able to be confident with their identity without external validation, where some seem *extremely* reliant on it. Same for some non-trans people in other dimensions of their life too, but it can't be easy to have a body that conflicts with how you see yourself."
967,News for you dude. You will always be seen as a caricature and not a real women because you are NOT a real woman. You're a man doing womanface. Fuck off.

976,"Hmmm. I wonder if he’s actually upset about the mocking...or jealous about the fact that drag queens still have access to that sweet, sweet “comfort and privilege.”"
977,"That's stupid. Men and women are free to dress up however they want at any time. Dressing in drag is not making a ""caricature out of womanhood"" because wearing a dress and putting on makeup is not ""womanhood."" Claiming that you *are a woman* because you like putting on dresses and wearing makeup-- now *that* is making a caricature of womanhood."

979,"Someone should tell them about ""Pippa"" Bunce."
980,"Yeah, they’re mad because they know identity doesn’t trump reality. Whatever the reason for adopting a woman persona you’re still a female impersonator."
981,"TIMs do too, but they expect everyone else to pretend otherwise."
982,Drag queens call each other “fish” which is gross and are insulting about women’s anatomy but at least they don’t think an inside out dick is exactly like a vagina
983,"THIS.  When's the last time anyone ever saw an AGP who got beat up for a ""swishy walk"" as a kid?"
984,I think they’re mad because they’re doing the same thing: drag queens put on accessories about adopt a woman persona. The only difference between TIMs and drag queens is that drag queens get paid and know it’s a performance. They’re both female impersonators.
985,"I mean tbf, there's a difference between a guy wearing a skirt because he likes it, and a guy doing drag. In the latter case, the presentation is chosen to deliberately evoke the imagery of womanhood, to be a ""man trying to look like a woman"", even though they are a self-admitted man."
986,"Except without any makeup skills, of course."
987,Pippa Bunche truly pulled a pro gamer move with whatever he’s doing. I hope it’s just elaborate performance art like Joaquin Phoenix did for that one documentary.
988,"And I get that, but I guess all that matters to me is that a dude isn't claiming to be a woman when he wears drag. If I were to be upset that he was dressing in a certain way it would only be reinforcing gender expectations ""you can't dress that way, that's for women!"" Clothing has evolved a lot and men used to wear skirts and things like that before they became associated with ""femininity."" I'm a woman and I don't ever dress even remotely similar to what a drag queen would wear. So to me, they are emulating a particular style that some women wear, but by no means are they playing out *womanhood*, because that has nothing to do with clothing choices."
989,We can be upset that they mock us.
990,"You don't need my permission to be upset. You have your opinion and I have mine. I don't see clothing and makeup as the definition of womanhood, so I don't see ""us"" or ""me"" when a man is in drag. 🤷‍♀️"

I have been driving since I was 10.  I drove my Dad's numerous cars on different tracks.   I understand understand the mechanics of racing how to drive fast safely.  I know how to control a car at 90+ mph.  This fool is going to hurt someone."
993,Don't men tend to be the more aggressive drivers though?
994,"Estrogen making you an aggressive driver, yeah, no. Just look into other cars sometimes while driving and you see who drives aggressively. In most cases, it's not a woman. But Tim won't understand that one 🙄"

Would they say it’s incitement for violence and hatred? Gc Radfems find the word Terf offensive, trans identifying people find the word “tra**y” offensive, and yet when you swap them out on memes one is somehow justified and the other somehow worthwhile. We don’t make memes like this about them because it’s dehumanizing. We don’t think trans people are sub-human, we think they’re misguided, dumb, or perverted, depending on the context. They get away with “jokes” like this because they latched onto a legitimate movement and managed to convince society that they are a mistreated minority. Anyone who thinks this sort of thing is funny whether as a joke or not is a disgusting human being. Maybe a bit of an extensive reaction for a brief meme but I’ve seen like three others like it today and it grates on my nerves."

But it's not me or any other women making his life hard for painting his nails and wearing a dress, it's rigid societal gender roles and the patriarchy you stupid little fuck. 

Hating and resenting women for existing and having it ""easy"" is textbook incel thinking. And very male. No woman alive feels remotely the same."

I think the most salient line is when he rants that women can wear dresses and leggings and *no one says anything about it.* Congrats man, you’re Gender Critical!

Listen man, if gender and the roles, expectations and norms didn’t exist; you could wear dresses to your hearts content. So instead of going all in on gender, go all out and reject it completely."

1049,"To add to that, I bet the vast majority of people who DON'T give women crap about wearing leggings and having nails done wouldn't give him crap either.  Will they think of him as a woman?  Probably not.  But people who don't give a shit will not give a shit across the board, and probably will even call him ""her""."
1050,He's so privileged it *pains* him not to have what he frivolously wants.
1051,Plain the modern state of toe tipping librealism for allowing males to be able to openly be violent misogynists as long as they put on a dress and call themselves Samantha
1052,"Yes, and also, one can wear a dress as a man anyway. It just takes confidence."
1053,He wants the gender roles though.  He just covers the role that society has assigned to the opposite sex.

1055,"I did not even a real strip club, a fictional one."
1056,"I'm just one person, but I can say when I ID'd as FtM, I never felt that way about males. If I had, my first inclination would have been to check in with my therapist because that's just scary."
1057," I've seen TIMs on Tumblr saying they hate specifically TIFs because 'they don't understand how good they have it, they're destroying what I want' etc. It's creepy."
1058,"Seriously, the fuck is that about?"
1059,"One thing I've really started believing since getting into this debate is that men get far more jealous than women and actually feel jealously much more keenly. Absolutely consumed with envy like a madness. Like you say, I've never felt that way. In situations where these guys would feel insanely jealous I'd usually just feel sad or lose self esteem. If I thought someone was better than me or had something I wanted I would focus in inside myself rather than obsessing about them.

And you don't just see weird make jealously in trans but in incels too and their obsession with the almighty Chad. On subs like inceltears they actually think those guys must be gay because they go on about other men's bodies and abilities so much. Another aspect of it is that when women fight men will always say ""oh, she's just jealous of you"" even when it's completely inappropriate. My dad was a right one for that. I was the kid no one was ever jealous of but his answer to every social problem I had was ""they're just jealous"" when I actually needed some help to relate to people better. Now I realise men do this because that's how they are. When they fall out or take against someone a lot of the time it's jealously rather than not liking the person. 

I know this isn't pure GC but it's coming up again and again and I don't think it's just socialization."
1060,Of course he didn't. Also those psychiatrists make more money pushing this you were born with a female brain crap. Big pharma is raking in the hormone therepy dough. It's a business.
1061,"There's a male associate at my local Target in CA who wears a skirt and tights every day. He's great at his job and (so far) I've never witnessed anyone pointing or laughing at him. Obviously I'm not always there but he works in the gaming/electronics dept. where a lot of men like to hang out. My husband loves going there to check out the latest games for his Switch so we've seen him pretty often, always rocking mid-calf length skirts and tights (he doesn't wear makeup or any other typically 'feminine' trappings). I think it's great that he's wearing what makes him comfortable. Honestly the first time he came over to help us with wireless plans, I didn't even notice he had on a skirt; my husband mentioned it after we left."
1062,Kurt Cobain pulled it off gloriously even in the early 90’s!

1064,Wow.  How self centered can you get?
1065,"Countless times I've been accused of being *jealous of prostitutes*, for being against prostitution, by men. The first time this happened I was speechless.  I think you have a point about them projecting."
1066,"> that men get far more jealous than women and actually feel jealously much more keenly

So this is why they constantly have to try to brainwash us into thinking we are the ones who are jealous of each other all the time. I have heard ''girls can't be true friends with each other cause they are always jealous of each other and hate each other even if they don't seem to be!'' so many times I wanna fucking puke..."

1069,"you’re right, but I can hope."
1070,I’m legitimately and pleasantly surprised almost all of the comments are all in support of the women suing! A rare moment of sanity!
1071,"Amazing how the majority of comments are pro-woman. I wasn't expecting so much support to be honest, I guess it's because it's so blatantly obvious how unfair that is.  


But the best part was going over to a trans sub read their comments and finding this absolute diamond:  


Person 1: every trans girl I know has trouble opening pickle jars  


Person 2: That's fucking evidence trans women are at the same level of strength as cis women!!  


LMAO, are they braindead or something? It's hard to believe it's not satire. I must be a man then, since I can open jars lol  
The best part is that a great majority of them were crying about how none of the comments presented evidence, but then this is the type of evidence they think it's valid."
1072,"65.6K upvotes! 

We have to believe that if the masses knew what was really going on with the trans lobby, they would be less woke.

There are posts about lesbians being expected to have sex with transwomen and if they/we refuse, we are called terfs. Comments were supportive of lesbians, in the vein of”Well, that’s not right”. 

It was heartening to read."
1073,"What brave young biological ladies! My hat's off to them for striking out at the unfairness of trans competition and stealing away chances for scholarships.

I got my fingers crossed for the same show of bravery at the women's events at this Summer's Olympic Games."
1074,"The flair now says ""BRIGADED."" Riiiiiiiiggggggghhhhhhhtttt...."
1075,How come I can't see any comments on the link?
1076,Because the blue-haired fetuses who pass for mods couldn't ban them all?
1077,"Oh gosh. Reading things they're saying in their own forums.

""FAKE FAN GIRL!! Name the 4 governing bodies and all the laws they passed between 1943 and 1967! You're not REEEEAL sports fan.""

Incels gonna incel. I was a high school athlete. Having boys beat me and my fellow women would do nothing but make us feel like second class citizens and eventually drop the sport. Heck maybe it's their goal. The only women among them would be bootlickers resigned to second class."
1078,"I totally agree! At the same time I feel like my head is going to implode because I see stuff like this with a lot of upvotes:

>I mean, I'm with you about all of it. I used running because it was in the article and is a great example, but you're right about all of it. Even in fighting, the power generated is partly related to bone structure in the shoulders and hips. Trans people don't bother me and I'll fight for their rights to live happy lives without having to be scared of harassment and to enjoy equality under the law. But in the realm of sports specifically, there are basic physiological biomechanics that cannot be changed even with hormone therapy. Theyr'e immutable characteristics.

And I'm screaming internally THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SAYING!!! THESE ARE THE SO-CALLED EVIL BELIEFS THAT ""TERFS"" HAVE!!! If the same comment was posted by someone who endorsed GC views, it would be downvoted to oblivion.

Whatever, at least people are catching on.."
1079,I forgot about the singular difference between men and women is being able to open jars. I guess this is why people call themselves gender fluid so fucking often.

1081,"I saw that pickle jar comment too, they truly think women are just walking stereotypes of femininity"
1082,">Person 1: every trans girl I know has trouble opening pickle jars 

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that trans identified males definitely would pretend to not be able to open a jar so that they can come off as ""cute and girly."""
1083,"All of GC wouldn’t touch that number of upvotes, lol.

Most of the world’s population are *gasp* pretty terfy."
1084,"That was my thought too! In the trans subs they are saying all of the top comments are from GC members so they can circle jerk and come up with reasons to invalidate perfectly reasonable objections to men in women’s sports. 

I have a fascination with biomechanics from various hobbies so even before I knew anything about trans or this bullshit there’s massive differences between male and female bodies besides just organs and appearance. Drives me insane that everyone ignores the importance of bone structure. 

Example: It’s common knowledge in show jumping and dressage that men have a higher center of gravity than women do, so they have a by far easier time balancing on a horse. Hormones and SRS will never negate that fact."
1085,"And even if they are asking for scientific evidence, the burden of proof is on their side, not ours. They're the ones who have to provide evidence that HRT and blocking T can reduce a man's bone density, height, lung and heart size, red blood cell count, change muscle build (not just density but all other aspects of it), bone structure, and so on, to the point of erasing every advantage a male build that goes through puberty has. They don't have any because that doesn't happen."
1086,This made me realise the sad truth that many autogynephiles would completely jump at the chance to wear a dead woman's body if it were possible and that's terrifying
1087,"What the necro-trans-woman bs is this? Even at my most self hating, I've never looked at a dead body and said ""What a good looking vessel that's gone to waste!"" This cuts to male socialization, and dualism and objectification of women. This is a new level."
1088,"He acknowledges that this feeling is “terrible, selfish” but still runs to reddit to try and get reassurance that’s it’s normal and totally not terrible or selfish. 

And the sentiment itself is just vile. What a sick freak."
1089,"You know what, this is to the point of scary. 

All I can think of is Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs, “It puts lotion on its body”.

What the hell?

Incels hate women. Transcels hate women."
1090,"Holy shit, this is some incel shit right here. They'd often go on about what a ""waste"" it was to bury/cremate the corpses of attractive young women when they could be fucking then instead."
1091,What the fuck. No. This is why I refuse to spend any second of my time with these creeps. I’m so glad I stopped giving into the “just be nice and polite to trans people” crap. Silence of the Lambs en masse.
1092,Get these depraved fucking monsters away from women and girls
1093,"Everyone of them is an Ed Gein wannabes. 

For those who don't know he was a real life serial killer who they  based Buffalo Bill and Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre on.  Please don't google him when eating or at work or around children."
1094,"Holy shit, this is disgusting."
1095,"I didn't know Ed Gein was 1, still alive, and 2, had a reddit account."
1096,what the fucking FUCK?!?!?!
1097,"I try to not go to their subs because if I see it here I can kind of delude myself into hoping it’s cherry picking, but when I do end up there I am always surprised at what doesn’t make it here. 

I just had to track down that post to see what they said:

>	“I think that is common. I have occasionally experience similar sensations.
>	But what gets me the most, is if I'm out in a store or something and I see an elderly woman who is barely getting around, and has aged significantly, I always wonder about the life that she had, all of her experiences both good, and bad, and I wish that I could somehow transport into her mind and feel all of that. 💕E” 



>	“Every one of those people you are jealous of are enduring struggles of their own and should be jealous of you for your ability to evolve.”



>	“Yes, I do the same. Especially some fellow Redditers who post about suicide and cutting near daily yet have a body I could only dream of having. Goes to show that the physical isn't everything.”

Y’all... I-"
1098,"Yes!

It also reminds me of when incels say that they are jealous of women because we can just ""have sex and even be paid for it whenever we want"" *because they just view it as the casual sex they fantasize about.* They either completely ignore or downplay all the risks of prostitution for the women forced or financially pressured into the practice and they definitely don't acknowledge that the sex is only pleasurable for the Johns."
1099,"Sometimes I find male socialization so fascinating. What kind of thoughts would I have or be bold enough to share if I got the social messaging that dude clearly received? Like, y’all women are emphatically told that there are about only a few moments when they are permitted to make things about themselves, wedding & pregnancy, but even then it’s met with condemnation. Imagine walking through life with the messaging that everything you think or feel or experience is not only important or valuable, but also deserves being shared to an audience. 

Would we reach that level of narcissism? As the great tswizzle once said, if I was a man, I’d be *the man*. But seriously holy shit I’ve never been jealous of a girl or woman who died."
1100,Wow. This is a new level of trans-id’d men’s objectification of women.
1101,This is one of the most disgusting things I’ve read on these groups. How fucking selfish do you have to be to make the passing of young women somehow about yourself and your gender issues? Foul.
1102,"Honey, someone should have sat you down a long time ago and told you that 1. Keep those thoughts to yourself, and 2. No one sane has thoughts like that to begin with.

1105,Wow I deeply regret opening this link
1106,"If the tech was possible I'm sure that a lot of them would try that. 
This is deeply unsettling. 

To identify as a woman is already odd, but to want to be a specific person? Wasn't there a serial killer like this?"
1107,"This sounds like the script of a horror movie waiting to happen.  Kind of like what Ed Gein did but in a more medically sophisticated way.  Somehow literally taking over the body, or having parts surgically transplanted instead of just constructing an outer covering of skin."
1108,Classic male entitlement. No hormone will change that. They are born with it.
1109,Well that’s not Ed Gein-ish at all.
1110,Why would you post that tho? wtf?
1111,I'm learning about self defense now because this shit gives me the creeps
1112,"And then he would probably not want it any more once it started to age, and he'd go get a different, younger model."
1113,Totally not Buffalo Bill tho
1114,"I know right, he acts like his tiny bit of self-awareness that these thoughts are ""terrible"" overcomes the fact that *he actively said this shit out loud looking for agreement*"
1115,Just one of a million reasons Self-ID is extremely dangerous
1116,"Get them away from everybody, really.  Don't let them recruit more men into their cult."
1117,"As someone who personally loves true crime, I'm always intrigued by how many infamous serial killers were transvestites. Iirc, the terrorist Timothy McVeigh from the OK city bombing had sexual fantasies around crossdressing.

Double interesting is that the older shows/documentaries will mention these sorts of details to emphasize the oddity of the killer, but newer ones often will not because that coverage would be ""transphobic"" despite that it would also be accurate. Often those fantasies play heavily into the motive, too so it would be relevant."
1118,"aw man, you beat me to it"
1119,"Lmao. Yeah man what the fucking fuck, I am also appalled hey"
1120,"To add to that, OMGWTFBBQ eleventyone."
1121,"Wtf. That is one of the creepiest, most objectifying things I've ever heard. They really do view female bodies as something that was taken from them. Any struggles we have, be it physical disorders or mental health, are just ""whining"" to  them because how dare we not be grateful we have what they want."
1122,"Wtf? Yeah, people cutting daily and committing suicide definitely have a better life than you...

That's not a normal thing people do.."
1123,">Like, y’all women are emphatically told that there are about only a few moments when they are permitted to make things about themselves, wedding & pregnancy, but even then it’s met with condemnation.

Holy fuck, yes. As someone planning her wedding rn that is so true. Even when ""it's your special day"" or whatever people will still call you stubborn or Bridezilla for insisting on anything. It's so, so, sooooo annoying and it makes you never want to put in your thoughts on anything for *your own wedding* because otherwise people will think you're shallow. 🙄"
1124,"Great thoughts here. I wonder about similar things whenever I see men being cruel and crazy about how women look. Women and girls are trained to say things like “looks aren’t important” or “I love dad bods”. Would we say all the same things if we had been trained to say whatever we wanted? Would we, too, be cruel and crazy? Would we start doing that thing where the mere existence of a man we don’t want to sleep with feels like literal violence?"
1125,"Wow this is so astute.  Growing up I was taught ""if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.""  Recently found out my brother was taught ""if you can't say something nice, say something else."""
1126,"I would add 3.  If you find yourself having those thoughts, get to a mental health provider ASAP.

But nowadays it might be hard to find one who wouldn't be afraid of being labeled transphobic and would call it like it is."
1127,Yes. I have no idea how anyone can say it’s not a mental health issue when it clearly is.
1128,I don't think this can be treated
1129,"That extreme jealousy all by itself is so scary.  They obsess over the bodies of women so much, what's to say one won't lose control on a bus or something and beat up a stranger, with the feeling ""if I can't have that body, nobody can."""
1130,"It almost comes off as a humblebrag, I think.  He's trying to say how good of a person he is for feeling terrible, and just wants everybody to he's not terrible at all."

1134,"Part of me wonders if this is \*just\* the influence of these insular online groups validating disturbed thinking... but the rest of me can't get past the idea of looking at a literal corpse and thinking 'man, if only I had that body.' Like... really, that's your thought? No reflection on how sad it is that a human has died? It's Frankenstein levels of gross, and he was supposed to be fictional...

But yeah, mental health is definitely required!"

1137,"Accurate. Or about who can be invited. Or about the venue. Or basically anything aside from the dress. The dress people will sometimes let go, but anything else is the bride being ""too controlling"""
1138,"It's because they weren't born female. They didn't grow up in a female body with all the sexism and the misogyny. As girls start to go through puberty and they start to develop breast growth, they start to become objectified. They will need to try  being vigilant to the possibility of being raped. If they are straight or bisexual they will need to use some form of birth control to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. As they go through menopause and their hair starts to gray, they go through the process of being ignored by men.

This is the lifecycle of being women in a Patriarichal and misogynistic and sexist.

These are things Trans women will never understand. They will always be outside the window looking in. The most they glean and understand are the gender stereotypes of femininity. Which is what they can LARP.

They might think they might want to be women but they aren't women. This is why I think they want to be in any Subs that are for women: to try to learn womanhood."

This is why a certain infamous swedish study showed they still wanted to kill themselves even after getting SRS. They know that they didn't really become the opposite sex; they just became a mutilated version of their former selves."

In a recent spate of dating, I've met some stark, staring idiots; I can't imagine any of them maintaining a relationship of any quality with a houseplant, let alone with a woman who thinks and (gasp) speaks.  

They seem to have forgotten (or never learned) the first rule of getting laid: don't say anything stupid, crazy or hateful enough to turn the woman off. Stow the crazy long enough for something to happen. When I was in my 20s, guys were actually pretty good at this - you'd be 6 months in and boffing away happily til he let his psycho out and you dumped him."
1156,"You could be on to something. I have been very sexually successful and have had quite the adventurous sex and dating life (though I've been settled down for many years now), I've always felt like I had options and have never been desperate (barring the initial awkwardness of my nearly forgotten adolescence)... and I don't have any ill-will towards women whatsoever.

&#x200B;

If you are correct then the problem is going to become unmanageable with the digital native 2.0 generation coming up, who are much worse at interpersonal relations in general and especially at dating, while simultaneously living increasingly in fantasy and virtual worlds and a immersed in a mainstream culture that now exemplifies unearned entitlement."

1172,"Because Trans Ideology is rigid in it's perception of gender performance. They really believe that clothes are an indicator of innate Gender Identity. A woman can't be heroic or be adventurers; they are supposed to be ""feminine"" and ""weak."" Otherwise they are MEN or Transmasculine NBs.

This BS is so riDICKulous. And this is the community that claims to want to abolish the concept of ""GENDER."" Their is something wrong with their brains. Even if they abolished ""Gender"" their would still be a tiny % of people who would still think they were in the ""wrong"" body configuration."

Lesson -2: DON'T RAPE WOMEN. Don't rape anyone.


Lesson -1: RAPE=sex without consent. 

 *""person ...tqp...having sex with""* - NO, you're forcing sexual activity, not ""having sex"", f.rapist.


Lesson 0: anyone has the right to not engage in, or to refuse to continue engaging in, sexual activity with another person, at any time, under any circumstances. There's absolutely NO need to justify it, EVER.


That man, who loves to talk endlessly about being the object of ""hatred"", is a woman-hater, i.e. a misogynist, a rapist or potential rapist.


His text reminds me of one of Magdalen Bern's video, in which she emphasizes **how much those men HATE YOU, women**"
1176,"Do they truly believe a WOC would ever want to engage in “sexual revolutionary violence” with a white supremacist man? When has this been happening? Where were the great numbers of black women raping white men during and after the civil rights movement?! There was not! No, only them raping us.
How fucking sick.
Why would you want to engage in retaliatory sexual violence with your oppressor?

Who ever does that may soon realize they are not the marginalized but rather the oppressor all along.

Oh, ho hum, underneath that dress they are the oppressors, men always, just waiting and wanting to rape women.

and this is not rape?"
1180,TIL « Sexual revolutionary violence » is when a black woman has sex with a white supremacist.
1181,">This is what they are agreeing to


Uhhhh yeah they are agreeing to have sex with women. So leave lesbians the fuck alone. I’ve had several women in my life who have been very important to me and who were lesbians, this type of ideology potentially being used against them makes me sick and angry."
1182,"Everything is an act of violence except for actual violence against real women, obviously 🙄"
1183,"That's not how consent works, bruh. It can be revoked at any time, for any reason. You're not entitled to colonize women's bodies. No means no, whether or not it hurts your feelings..."
1184,You can fucking call something off if you get tired or just change your mind. These people have no idea what consent is.
1185,"That is textbook incel rhetoric. Ticking time bombs of self loathing and entitlement. And I wish they’d stop trying to appropriate shit that black women deal with to make their nonsensical, sex starved cases. Whenever they deem black women to even be women that is.  Seriously, fuck those guys and anybody misogynistic enough to support them."
1186,"\> How can a marginalized person assault a member of the oppressive class?

By either threatening to or by actually physically touching the member of the 'oppressive class' without their consent. Just because society has baggage and some groups have more power than others does NOT mean that anything goes between individuals in the downtrodden group and everyone else.

This isn't that hard."
1187,"I’d also like to point out that lesbians haven’t consented to have sex with every single woman on earth, just like straight women haven’t consented to have sex with every single man just for being straight."
1188,"White supremacist males don't object to sex with women of colour, historically they've been very happy to rape them, and I doubt women of colour want to rape Nazis, so the only rape rights he's fighting for are his own."
1189,"WOW. Next it’ll be ‘you don’t get to call something off just because I choked you, my kink is my identity and you’re oppressing me’."
1190,"I fucking hate seeing ""WOC"" used as a noun. A wok is a style of cookware. I'm a woman of color, not a damn acronym. Type it out, motherfucker. It's the same objectifying bullshit used to dehumanize radical feminists and Alexandria Occasio-Cortez, reducing real human beings (WOMEN) to acronyms to use them as gotcha talking points. Ahhhhhhhh

(sidenote I have a feeling acronym-as-noun is in part perpetuated by Twitter's restrictive character limit (as well as general human laziness) but still. We're all typing on keyboards it really is not that much extra effort to spell out the whole thing.)"
1191,"You are saying what **most** of us are thinking, bb."
1192,"Remember... These **men** celebrated when she died. Unabashedly. And none of us had the courage to stand up to them.

To this day I'm ashamed of myself for that."
1193,"Thanks for the silver, kind stranger x"
1194,"They are mainly white supremacist males, and view everything through their prism (white male sexual fantasies). In their minds we have no sexual fantasies ( even lesbians) in which they are not front and center! They’re like toddlers, demanding attention."
1195,"Not if you are low enough on the Oppression Spectrum™️! If you are, then apparently (according to this dude) anyone more oppressed than the person oppressing them is allowed to hate-fuck their oppressors.  You know... For equality!"
1196,RIGHT
1197,"It's rape, full stop. The trans activist love to push rape culture & authoritarianism under the guise of wokeness."
1198,"I saw it more as a trans""woman"" is allowed to rape a lesbian, since lesbians have already ""agreed to have sex with other women.” Ofc this completely negate the fact that lesbians aren’t trying to fuck every woman in the world, which just reinforces my belief that not only are these men delusional and misogynistic, they are also deeply, DEEPLY homophobic."
1199,"Thank you, we appreciate the support. Many of us took a while to accept our sexuality and being pressured to have sex with TIMs and harassed if we don’t is really hard."
1200,"I mean, are they “agreeing to” have sex with anyone, really?

I’m straight, but that doesn’t mean I’m open for business for any interested man. I don’t see why lesbians would be any different. 

You agree to sex on a case by case basis, not as a blanket statement."
1201,"Oh, they know. They just don't care about consent."
1202,"I have no idea why modern feminists thing transwomen are owed sex. To think our feminists foremothers did so much to fight for women to realize their to say no. We both face societal pushback. They were called all kinds of slurs. We're called TERFs.

Just remember that women who fall for this BS and get raped by transwomen are still victims, no mattter how much of the kool-aid they've drunk. We will still fight for their rights and comfort."
1203,"Omg... It's SO crazy when a complete stranger says something online that I have 100% thought for ages.

Le sigh...we need some kind of group where we can all meet. I get so discouraged with all my neo-liberal friends who are too scared to speak up for women's/Lesbians rights...

The only time I get to talk to people who aren't brainwashed is on Reddit."
1204,"I got someone banned from Twitter recently for saying hateful things about Magdalen Berns. I don’t report often as I’m all for free discourse, but his comments about a dead woman made my blood boil. I was actually quite shocked that twitter banned him for it, but goes to show how out of order it was!"
1205,"No thanks for the downvote, unkind stranger 👎"
1206,"I'd honestly like one of them to try and explain how it is not rape. Please, spell that one out for us."
1207,">I saw it more as a trans""woman"" is allowed to rape a lesbian, since lesbians have already ""agreed to have sex with other women.”

Agreed. 


A long time ago I heard a man (breaking news), self declared 'anarchist' (ha f.him), saying, about a woman who had been raped, that it was nothing bc she had sex with everybody.


That's how most men 'think', and now they're targeting lesbians with their T/MRA-rape ideology."
1208,Gotta love TRAs... downvoting anti-rape comments for being transphobic. LOL
1209,"The crazy thing is even by their own logic it's rape. Saying ""trans women are women"" doesn't change the fact that they aren't ""cis"" women. If someone doesn't want to date or have sex with ""trans women"" they don't have to; even if the TRAs wanna consider it transphobic. They're transphobic since they won't sleep with trans women? Tough shit. Doesn't give you the right to not tell them."
1210,"LOL gotta love the nice, kindly pro-rape **men**


Bless their sparkly hearts 🤜🤜🤜"
1211,It's almost like they're mysogynists
1212,That's because they're using you to hurt women. That's always their agenda. They don't actually give a fuck about your lives.
1213,"same guys who call themselves feminists by only cause they wanna watch *totally consensual and empowering* teenage gangbang porn

radfems                                          transwomen

           ""fuck off pseudo woke cis males""


edit: i don't think the meme formatting carried :/"
1214,"Probably because almost no one disagrees on the first two points so it's not much of an argument. I've encountered very few people who think someone should be thrown out on the street or lose their job solely because they believe themselves to be the opposite sex. Those few who do think that also think it should be okay to kill them for sport, though, so yeah, actual real transphobes."
1215,"Remember a few years ago when TRAS really ramped it up?  \[I think it was around about when USA had only just legalised same-sex marriage, and almost all the trans rights material was in American English\]

Maybe because the Trans activists went on so much about how their ""Trans Rights!"" campaign was exactly like ours, for Lesbian and Gay rights, the differences became more noticeable.

For example, I assumed the immediate priorities, if they were like ours (LG&B) would be the basics of wanting to not get beat up, raped, killed, sacked, or evicted, just for being (or assumed to be) gay. 

I expected to see the first big Trans campaigns of this era to focus on practical assistance for trans in or at risk, dealing with poverty, facing homelessness, violence, unemployment, poverty related risks eg physical/mental health, substance use, exploitation, sex trade bringing into contact w/police etc 

But nope. Within 5 minutes it was all obsessing about toilets and wanting to sleep with lesbians."
1216,"I really like when they use the arguement 'what about masculine women huh?! Are you gonna ask them to drop trouser and inspect them to use the bathroom?!' Which is fairly insulting. Even so-called ""masculine"" women look like goddamn women still."
1217,"Vocal liberal/leftist males,""feminists"" or TRAs,  are the most creepiest ever."
1218,don’t worry we got the point
1219,61 awards for that. Reddit is so out of touch with reality.
1220,imagine spending money to give awards to the idiot who made such a bold and daring comment (in overwhelming numbers to show that they are right and other poster is wrong). people are pathetic.
1221,Please tell me this isn't real
1222,"You gotta note, though, despite the  guaranteed 16.8k woke downvotes, u/TWAM still has positive 10k ;)"
1223,I can. I wish reddit made an option to block people with curse words or slurs in their usernames. I've definitely refused to upvote people b/c of it.
1224,This is honestly disturbing. 61 people thought bashing another person's username is a good idea worth spending money or coins on
1225,as some wonderful soul on /r/GenderCritical said: this is what libfem activism in 2020 looks like
1226,Whole lot of TIMs with money to burn. Their comments no matter how useless or full of shit are always getting awards.
1227,VALIDATION 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
1228,"Oh no, it’s painfully real. The same way biological sex is ;)"
1229,"Then you know they'd ban ""transwomenaremen"" as a slur too. Don't give them more ammunition to use against the GC."
1230,Slurs I potentially understand but curse words? Seems a little unreasonable
1231,Lol
1232,Just block them. You can't see their comments after that.
1233,The pile on went on in multiple comments dragging that user as a TERF.
1234,"Suddenly I get why Media tries to appeal to them. First thought that came to my mind was ""how can I use this to make them give me money"""
1235,"I thought i wrote block. There are personal blocks on reddit, i'm not sure the other person is even notified. I imagine something like when you toggle the nsfw setting. I think i was in it, when i noticed some very nsfw usernames. Could be personalized words too."
1236,">copper IUDs work wonders 

Ha, ha. 

>and it also gets rid of the severe cramping 

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

>and slows down your period to a light dribble

 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
1237,"Actually, copper IUDs are notable for *more* uterine cramping, heavier and more irregular bleeding. 


Get fucked."
1238,"Dribble? A DRIBBLE? 

as a uterus haver aka a woman I’m not cool with people who seem to have a mans understanding of periods tell me about birth control and blood flow 

also as a lesbian I don’t want to date anyone that’s ever been male regardless of how he identifies or how entitled he feels 

I’m no ones validation"
1239,"Oh do fuck off.  And do not recommend period products to actual women, you mentally ill pervert."
1240,"Do they not understand how much less annoying they'd be if they would shut up about their penises for one second?  I peaked because on damn near every post in a lesbian sub I read that was about women's issues had people saying things like ""not all women have uteruses"".  Like, okay, even if I fully accept that you're a woman, stfu.  No one was talking about you, and they didn't need to be talking about you.  If I post in a running forum about leg cramps, should I be expected to get bombarded with comments like ""not all runners have legs!"" and then be banned for not talking constantly about amputees?  And get dragged and doxxed for being ampuphobic?  I don't tell a Panera employee that I have cats when they ask for my order because, while I do, that's not relevant to my sandwich and they shouldn't get fired for not asking me if I have cats before asking me what type of bread I want my tuna salad on."
1241,[deleted]
1242,"iuds are a huge source of cramping and are MEDICALLY NOT RECCOMENDED TO PEOPLE WHO ALREADY GET SEVERE CRAMPS

nexplanon is really the best long term, least invasive solution"
1243,"Without meaning to sound dramatic-how dare they...?

To ""recommend"", i.e DEMAND ""uterus-havers"" to get IUDs implanted (or any other form of birth control, for the matter)  absolutely sickens me."
1244,"Um? No, I am not attracted to males, thank you.

I never saw the day when my sexuality has been bombarded with this nonsense. I really dread for the future when it becomes a crime to say my own sexuality excludes people. BECAUSE HELLO! sexualities exclude people by definition. They think this is a gotcha moment, a-ha! 'well now im a woman so date me!' just ew.

And no, if you are sexually attracted to males(transgender identified males included), you are not lesbian. You could be bi or straight. You tell me XD"
1245,"What, does wearing a condom trigger your ""dysphoria?"""
1246,"Written by a man. No woman would ever y’all about her period “slowing down to a light dribble.” Ficking A man. It’s light, it’s heavy, but really? No one talks like that. Lesbians! Get an IUD! Could y’all Just mind your own business please? Jesus"
1247,"As well as the obvious overall wrongness from moral perspective it’s also factually incorrect, copper iuds make periods heavier and increase cramping for many women. Even the hormonal coil caused me 6 months of daily cramping and bleeding until it did eventually make my periods lighter"
1248,Im so tired of this word salad nonsense ugh
1249,"These MEN can fuck off with this bullshit. We'll never have sex with you, get over it!"

1255,"Okay, maybe I'm just an uneducated man, but don't copper IUD's work by causing irritation and inflammation so the egg has nothing to stick to?"
1256,I AM A WOMAN NOT A UTERUS HAVER FUCK ALL THE WAY OFF
1257,IUDs have are T bars made of polyethylene with contraception reseviors at the ends.
1258,"""change your body and go on medication on the off chance that one day you become attracted to a man"" nothing dodgy there"
1259,So *sometimes* it's okay to call a girldick a penis?  But mostly just when telling women that women are still the ones who need to be responsible for birth control.
1260,"i-

but-

what if you don't want kids.

and a pre bottom trans is a male (All AMABs are). lesbians are not attracted to males."
1261,That’s what happens when a man gives you advice about female contraception methods
1262,Literally the copper IUD is effective BECAUSE it irritates your insides which makes your period worse and more crampy. This fucking guy holy shit 🙄
1263,"That's how I felt reading that too. Like yeah, maybe it works that way for the like, .0000007% of goddesses who are able to have no side effects and no period on the copper IUD. But almost everyone I've met who's been on it has an opposite story to tell."
1264,That was my first thought. “Get your IUDs straight!”
1265,Exactly. The whole thing is wrong.
1266,"Can confirm, going to get this fucker removed soon!"
1267,"He didn't even get the IUD right, the copper one can make cramps worse."
1268,I read this in a British accent.
1269,">What ***he's*** saying is homophobic.

FTFY"
1270,"It's almost like this male is lying to women about the reality of IUDs to get them to prevent his pregnancies for him, just like most males in our society. ""Come on lesbians, let a penis in! But make sure you're protected first - can't have my male mistakes coming back to haunt me!"" Wear a fucking condom FFS."
1271,"Nexplanon is fucking awful, I bled for two years straight. No exaggeration. I had to get it because my cervix wouldn't dilate enough for IUD insertion. Everything sucks, send help"
1272,"And we can't even make these memes anymore! Things about periods or being a gay woman, anything to do with body or our experiences, cause a tiM will come in here and say ""well actually..."" xD"
1273,"> sexualities exclude people by definition

This seems so obvious but I think you’re the first person I’ve seen put it into words, and it highlights how ridiculous and counterintuitive the “inclusivity” movement is getting. Suddenly you’re not allowed to set boundaries, and all the lines are becoming blurred. Everything needs to include everybody. There are differences between people; they deserve to have distinct spaces and definitions."
1274,"For most people I know who have been on the copper IUD their periods got worse, I'm on the mirena IUD to treat my periods and God I still get the red sea surging."
1275,"Yes, it's called sterile inflammation. Doesn't sound too pleasant, and any kind of inflammation can cause other problems in the body, like hair loss and depression for example."
1276,"Some, like Mirena, do.

Others are made of copper and contain no hormonal contraceptive at all."
1277,"Not to mention that lots of women opt out of iuds for different reasons! I didn’t get one because I was fucking terrified they’d perforate my uterus and something awful would happen since you have to sign all these informed consent papers about what could go wrong during the procedure. This idiot wouldn’t even know that the procedure itself carries risk and pain, it’s a sterile body cavity you’re not supposed to put anything in there for a reason. Women do have bad reactions to them which can be dangerous and scary when it’s an item you yourself cannot remove."
1278,how do you know?
1279,Condoms are oppressive. Didn't you know?
1280,"I also bled for almost two years straight with that hell stick. Got it out about a year ago and I feel like a new person. No extreme pms, no months long period. I switched to depo and I couldn’t be happier with it, you should look into it if you haven’t already. I started it because a close friend of mine swore by it and it stopped periods for both of us, I’ve only bled once since I started about a year ago."
1281,Thought they got rid of the copper because it can damage the uterine lining.
1282,He’s giving misinformation about copper IUDs with a know it all tone.
1283,"I think my doctor told me depo wouldn't be the best option for me, booooo 👎 I'm on the three month bc pill, it seems to be the lesser of all the evils for me"
1284,"They made the Mirena coil, which contains hormonal contraceptive instead of copper, as an alternative to traditional IUDs so women have the choice of either. Both are available in the UK although I can't speak for any other countries without checking."
1285,Here the T is the gold standard. There's also a push for the Depo Provera implants in the US.
1286,"We have the implant here too, however that's also hormonal contraception (although the implant and mirena coil use lower levels of hormones because they don't have to enter the bloodstream via digestion).

So far as I'm aware, the copper IUD is the only non-hormonal contraceptive apart from barrier methods so it's unlikely that it would be removed from the market at least until an alternative is available."
1287,"That’s because they’re mentally ill, babe."
1288,"Very dishonest also . They always have to be the victim, if nothing actually happened they make it up or drastically embellish something. I've had one or two interactions with TRAs where they have just tried to blatantly make up stuff I had said after the fact and spread it around online.  For all their talk about GC being a ""hate group"" they really do spend an awful lot of their own time hating us and making up lies about us."
1289,"Yeah, I'm sometimes tempted to correct posts on GenCyn,... but the one time I reached out to bring up something said that was provably, factually wrong(and it was pretty minor) the person was incredibly rude and just nasty with her insults. The most sarcastic things I say on a bad day don't come close to the bitterness and violence they throw around about us casually. It's not worth reaching out to them, even politely.

The thread's already died down at this point once the Tim came out and cooed over the comments telling him what a stunningly beautiful ""woman"" (sic) he is."
1296,Thanks but I really didn't go through anything at all.

Everyone acts so progressive and woke like
“Talk about your mental health! Share with a friend! It’s ok to not be ok!”  Then they SHIT on women who go “Im not ok with this! It makes me feel uncomfortable.”

1340,I think he had one at one point.  He lost a lot of followers when the Yaniv thing blew up.  I strongly suspect he buys bot followers to make himself look important so maybe those don't count towards blue checks.
1341,Has he ever won an election?
1342,Yes! Don’t screw around with managers.
1343,"Trump as president is pretty lame, but I'll take him over living in Canada any day of the week."
1344,I am going out on a limb a saying that’s not what he meant because he’s too narcissistic for that. Just the other day he replied something along the lines of “look at this pathetic man giving opinions on women’s issues” and I was like excuse me sir have you looked at a mirror recently
1345,I'm pretty sure he did at one point as well.
1346,"I thought Twitter users had to pay $1,000 to get a blue checkmark and that it's not based on follows, at least that's what I heard."
1347,"Oger served two consecutive one-year terms as one of five provincial vice-presidents in the NDP. By the end of the second term all political capital had been used up and Oger failed to even be nominated. According to some, anonymous sources said Oger had almost no support inside the party by that point. According to Oger, he didn't even want the VP job because he wanted to focus on another run at the provincial seat for the district of Vancouver-False Creek.

Oger's close friend and ally, fellow TIM Catherine Jenkins is the long-serving president of the Vancouver-False Creek NDP association and Oger has served several roles on the executive for that NDP provincial electoral district which explains how he has now twice been nominated to run for the provincial seat but this doesn't seem to be the case for the larger federal electoral district of Vancouver-Centre where Oger has failed to be nominated and as far as I can tell has never served on the executive for the federal district NDP association. 

Oger was badly beaten when trying to run for the school board, was narrowly defeated in a previous election for the provincial seat, came in last out of three nominees when seeking  to run as the NDP candidate for the federal seat. Following this defeat Oger's normally active twitter and Facebook accounts went silent for a couple days then Oger complained about losing a hard fought battle and did not publicly congratulate or endorse the nominee.

While both the provincial and federal NDP have never commented on Oger's public antics, rumour has it Oger was encouraged to seek federal nomination in order to get him out of the province (promoting the problem out of the way, from the perspective of the provincial party)

Oger is now preparing for his second campaign for the provincial seat against the 2-term incumbent Liberal. I expect he won't do as well as last time. Reputation has been damaged by defunding VRR, perceived support for Yaniv or at least for Yaniv's cause, and generally ridiculous and toxic behaviour on twitter."
1348,No.
1349,I wouldn’t put it past him to pay for one.  Now that he’s no longer vp of the NDP and has to rely on his wages from Best Buy he can’t afford it.
1350,Nothing says first world problems quite like arguing about who is the most oppressed on reddit.
1351,Omg that is fucking hilarious.
1352,Eventually the snake eats itself lol.
1353,"How can people be anything but lesbian if they “are lesbians?” 

Smfh lesbian means I like cooter, nothing else. How fucken hard can that be to understand ?🤦🏻‍♀️"
1354,Wow. WOW. I have to log off. This is too much. 😂
1355,"Funny, this is how I feel about ""AMAB non-binary Demi girls"" who pretend they’re lesbians."
1356,Ugh. Can it hurry up and finish already?
1357,"I mean, so do a lot of trans people."
