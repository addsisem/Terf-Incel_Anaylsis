0,gendernormie,"Absolutely. Part of detransitioning and accepting womanhood for me was realizing the only reason woman has any connotations other than female human is sexism. You take away the biological definition of woman and all that's *left* is sexism.

Edit: Thanks for my first silver, kind stranger!"
1,Tweeders55,Well I have now been banned from men writing women because there was a meme of a 50's wife worshiping her husband by fixing dinner kneeling at his lap. Someone commented on how to be her and someone else responded to identify as as a woman. I responded be born a woman. Well that set a few TIMs brain on fire. I'm again a terf and according to the mods all trans who identify as female are female regardless. I was banned forever with the exception of reading and voting. So men writing women had TIMs more in mind than women with vaginas. Irony at its finest.
2,villanelle23eve,This.

6,jzerocoolj,It's almost as if... he totally could have been a cross-dresser in the privacy of his own home and presented as fucking normal otherwise. Most people don't parade their fantasies out in the real world.
7,hedaleksa,"Translation: I’m going to be myself at work because being a woman is something I can opt into our out of whenever it benefits me because I am a man. Ya know his version of being a woman is totally real and valid and not at all a costume he can take off whenever he wants to advance his career. 

Super embarrassing that he thinks being himself is cross dressing and living a double life.

36,teatrips,Why are they obsessed with TERFs? TERFs don't kill them. TERFs don't add to their death toll. Why don't they give this medicine to men who kill them?
37,knight_siegmeyer,Report them. They likely won't do anything about it but we should start collecting violent screeds like this and reporting it to mods.
38,sosososhocking,"Exposing the harms of SRS goes against a narrative, so of course that's against the rules.

64,teatrips,"Right? TERFs have ""blood on their hands"" is what I have heard so much from them - and what about them? How much blood do they have on their hands? Just to accommodate their petty comfort politics we ought to stop talking about women getting brutalised and killed everywhere. We ought to merge gay/lesbian movements with their doubly regressive/reinforcing values. We ought to change the definition of the very basis of oppression because they want to feel oppressed first and foremost. And most importantly, it's the TERFs who should take the fall for the problem all along - men and their violence!"
65,knight_siegmeyer,"No, they don't hide it. It's really telling. (And surprise! violently male. 'Someone disagrees with my sexist portrayal of women! Better threaten them with a bat!'.) And thank you for what you do! I also report it if I see it. We'll see if anything comes of it."

79,TheSecondComing97,"I kept wondering why they always use fictional characters for this stupid “x character says trans rights”.

It's another of these shitty 'we want to maim you, TERFs, but not really, tee-hee' kind of memes, but it would've been even shittier if they went with the term 'pussy' (which is what they do, at least most of the time)."

100,Blue_Train,"It is, but vulva is not the female equivalent of a penis. They're grossed out by the word 'vagina' just like teen boys. Also, Vulva almost sounds like the name of a female superhero."
101,LookieLookyy,"I genuinely do not understand how you people think that using some fictional character to parrot  your opinions somehow validates that opinion & that any ""terf"" is going to look at that and feel any emotion, but utter embarrassment for the person who made it lmao.

106,pm_me_your_sad_tales,"English isn't my first language so I gotta ask; I thought the vulva is the exterior parts of the female sex organ, so how is it not the female equivalent of a penis? Isn't the vagina the connection between the vulva and the cervix/uterus? I tried googling this but I just got confused because I read about it in both Swedish and English, sorry for a (probably) dumb question."
107,Blue_Train,"Yes, at least, this hate-meme isn't scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel. Can you just imagine what's going on inside the head of someone who decides to spend his time making this crap? And what the rejected ideas pile looks like?"

I'll also add that I think another reason they make the comparison to vulva is because the srs docs actually try to reproduce the visible whereas even MTTs are seemingly willing to admit that hole created to stand in for a vagina has very little in common with an actual vagina."
109,pm_me_your_sad_tales,"Thank you so much for the link and explanation! Now I understand what you meant. There was a nuance of language there I couldn't quite wrap my head around at first, but now I get it."

My boss  lets his meetings run into ours regularly, and when we are in a meeting he answers emails and ignores me while I'm talking. I might never be taken seriously at this job. And it's because I was born with a female body. Not because I decided I have special gender feelings that are going to have guide my entire life and personality.

You do the math."
151,moonflower,"That's fair enough, but unfortunately they have already taken the word ''woman'' and trashed it. The dictionary will be updated as soon as they can figure out how to define the word without it being either a circular definition or a nonsense."
152,BarronIsAnAnchorBaby,"Trans women are something like 0.3% of the population vs about 50% for cis women, so based on the numbers you gave trans women already have an 11% higher risk. That's ignoring the fact that trans women victims are substantially undercounted as your own link very clearly points out. The number for all women comes from actual statistics recorded from every murder, whereas the number for trans women comes from advocates curating whatever news stories they can find.

Most trans victims will just be recorded as one sex or the other, with no record of them being trans unless they're publicly out and someone happens to mention that in a news article, and that news article happens to be published on the internet and then happens to be found by an advocacy organization."
153,Boingo0220,"They can't though. That's the thing. I'm keeping the word, language has power."
154,bunnyday_,"Percentages aren’t always the best way to measure things. Especially in such a huge discrepancy in population size (women vs trans women). Like you said it’s .3% of the population, of course every additional number is going to make the percentage higher. 


Even knowing that they aren’t always accurately recorded, isn’t it pretty obvious that women are killed more? Like you really think there a few thousand trans women deaths that are just not being recorded?"
155,moonflower,"I admire your efforts to turn back the tide, and cheer for you, but unfortunately I have already retreated to the next line of defence which is to fiercely defend the word ''female'' ... they are coming for it and I'm not giving it up without a fight"
156,BarronIsAnAnchorBaby,"Yes, ""every additional number is going to make the percentage higher"", that's kind of my point?

If there were a few thousand trans women deaths alongside the few thousand cis women deaths, that would make trans women hundreds of times more likely to be murdered, not equally likely to be murdered. Do you seriously not understand how proportions work or are you just screwing with me?

It's not ""pretty obvious"" that cis women are killed more, given that I did just demonstrate that trans women are killed more"
157,bunnyday_,"I’m saying when the population sample is so incredibly tiny compared to a enormously larger population percentages don’t make sense as a metric to use. I know how proportions work, and I also know that percentages aren’t always the proper metric to use, such as in this case where one population is around a million or less, and the other is around 167 million. More women are killed every year than trans women. This is literal facts. And shit this is even going off numbers I spent ten seconds looking up, I’ve seen numbers that show a higher murder rate for men and women than trans men and women but I have no idea where I saw them. Either way I’m not saying it’s not important that 26 whole humans were killed in a single year, that’s awful and sickening. But if we compare it to the number of women killed it doesn’t really compare. 


Not to mention the root of all this is men being responsible for the *vast* majority of these killings of trans women, not feminists. The real focus should be on the males who commit these crimes, not radfems."
158,BarronIsAnAnchorBaby,"In these supposed situations where percentages just don't work, I'm pretty sure the standard operating procedure isn't to give up and say ""well 3895 is bigger than 26 so fuck it whatever"". By that logic no minority group ever matters.

205,Free2BMe80,Idk what is an enby lesbian either?
206,griffxx,Nonsense. You are a bisexual... that's it. But they are trying to also Identify as lesbians. Then they cry about Biphobic Erasure.
207,IndependentRadio,I'm a bi cis woman and I don't feel entitled to access lesbian-only spaces unless I know that that bi women are also welcome. Probably because I don't have a male sense of entitlement.
208,sool47,Yep. I'm bi and would never dare to go to a lesbian only space. Even though I like women more than men. But we need to respect their spaces. I wouldnt want white people at a non white people meeting. It's not discrimination. It's called having your own spaces. And there are plenty spaces where you overlap.
209,Bigclit2020vision,"It's dumb, and it's not like lesbians exclude bi women anyway. Well not that I've found."

216,nunquamver,"It’s just people trying to shove themselves into every exclusive space because they really think they’re that freaking relevant. I’m bisexual and never in a million years I’ll try to enter a lesbian-exclusive space if I’m not welcome in it, it’s just plain disrespectful."
217,Raineyclouds,"Mmmno there's unfortunately groups of lesbians who say bi people are ""untrustworthy"" because they're also attracted to men. 

The way I see it in terms of spaces. If a space is called a ""lesbian space"" it's for lesbians only. ""WLW space"" is open to all woman who are attracted to woman."
218,sillylily789,"I agree that bi women need to stop calling themselves bi lesbian. But as a bisexual woman, there's definitely been plenty of lesbians who didn't want me involved in wlw spaces, or didnt want to date me after finding out I was also into men."
219,Rada-Wong,Why are you on this sub? Genuinely curious.
220,nellie1296,"I don’t get why these people don’t understand that the terms straight, gay male, lesbian and bisexual are all mutually exclusive. One cannot be two or more of them by the definition of each of the terms. You can be a bisexual in a heterosexual relationship in which case you are still bisexual, or bisexual in a homosexual relationship in which case, you guessed it, still a bisexual. Being into trans doesn’t exempt you from these either because all trans people have either a male or a female body (they may well have mutilated it but it still remains either male or female). For all the LGBT educators they seem to have out there at the moment they don’t seem to have any grasp on the bloody fundamentals."

223,griffxx,I respect your position. But there are events that are Inclusive.
224,tanoren,"I mean, I don’t know why bisexuals wouldn’t be welcome when we are WLW also. Sure lesbian exclusive spaces are okay but I don’t see the point in exclusion when bisexuals are also into women. I do understand some experiences can vary. That being said I’m not going to go into lesbian exclusive spaces if they don’t want it, lord knows lesbians give enough hate to bisexuals as it is and I don’t want to deal with that bs."
225,WeeklyWinter,"I hate myself, mostly.
But also because I genuinely do not see the issue with a woman using he/him pronouns. If you don’t believe trans people exist, what’s wrong with using different pronouns? It’s not changing your gender or mutilating themselves."
226,Manaxium,"No, it’s PrOgReSs"
227,lonesomehere,"Everyone hates bisexuals. Not in a violent oppression way (except the homophobes), just in a general “ew lol” way. And they all have their own special way as follows:

Straight men: fetishize because “girl on girl” but still think you’re a slut or a liar for women, general homophobia for men

Gay men: general misogyny for women, not gay enough i.e. “gold star only” for men

Straight women: always think you’re hitting on them OR you’re doing it for attention OR will let you kiss them and go down on them but think *your* vagina is gross, general homophobia “he’s just gay but won’t admit it” for men

Lesbians: you’re doing it for attention or not gay enough for women, general (if deserved) distaste for maleness for men

Trans: mad that you won’t immediately date them for both genders, especially mad for women

There isn’t a group of people on earth who can just chill tf out and accept bisexuals except other bisexuals. Don’t bother looking for it, I’ve tried and it doesn’t exist."
228,hackstreetsback,Are there really women who identify as women and still want to be called he/him?
229,Minoxidil,"some women take on gendered honorifics like ""sir"" in militant positions, historically some lesbians went by he/him for protection, and there was that one character ""daddy"" on orange is the new black who was clearly a lesbian woman but preferred for her partners to refer to her with male pronouns

so yes, but also not really."

266,villanelle23eve,"There is a case to be made that there are some specific symptoms of dysphoria, and certain actions that are not consistent with those symptoms.

And the more transgenders try to BECOME, the further they take themselves from the effortless ""is"" that is the natural woman they want to become; they try so hard, they are willing to ruin their bodies, their minds, their cultures in order to ""become"" - and the harder they try, the further they take themselves away from it and the more they become Frankenstein's caricature.

And so also this man will develop more and more rage and hatred towards women who simply ""are"", the more he tries to ""become"" one. He will mutilate his body, ruin his health, ruin his mind, try to bully and blackmail people into silence and submission - and the more he tries to ""become"" a woman, the more rage he will feel against people who just effortlessly ARE women..."

You’re stigmatizing Transgender as a quirky fun trait. Enforcing the idea that we’re some sort of elitist trendy minority group.

Transitioning isn’t fun. Coming out of the closet isn’t fun. It’s life changing and entire parties of people (and potentially my family) could end up judging, hating and disowning me for it.

I don’t WANT to be trans more than someone WANTS to be gay.
But there’s no “cure” for gender dysphoria. It runs too deep biologically, mentally and even historically, like homosexuality.
Difference is, most people have gotten used to homosexuality. 
But Transgenderism is only now becoming more “accepted” and exposed to the public. Meaning officially joining that group will lead to you recieving a lot of hate. Not just from conservatives, but even from other minority supporting groups (LGB Drop the T, GenderCritical, Radical feminists)

342,moonflower,"Yes, I think it's an issue which can be addressed by feminists, because  young girls are influenced by the gender roles which society imposes on them, and for many who feel they are transgender, their feelings about gender roles are part of the process of coming to think they are transgender"

I don't think the trans community wants them. I think they're ashamed of them, and wish they'd go away.

345,nonotmyworntube,why tf this getting downvoted i just wanted to know pfttt
346,Lady_Montgomery,Approximately a third of transgenders go off the radar shortly after srs and they are not taken into account of the dreaded 41%. So that number might actually be higher than that.
347,griffxx,"I guess I feel a lot of bitterness, about what went down in 2014. There were a series of meetings with representatives stakeholders of the Reproductive Justice Movement. ( PP, funders contraception and abortions.... including TMs & NBs. They were meeting together to discuss how they could be Inclusive in the language usage for OFAB Trans Spectrum persons.

The suggestion was Women & OFAB Persons. Not good enough for the OFAB TRAs, it had to be Gender Neutral across the board; which is how Women became uterus havers, menstrators, pregnant persons, gestators , birth person.

They have been actively involved in FEMALE ERASURE. The next attack was against the North American Midwives Association and the Doulas.

That whole Always Venus symbol removal was just petty and a drop in the bucket, compared to the above."
348,griffxx,I think it's both gender roles and gender stereotypes. Plus the low self-esteem and selfloathing.

351,Peakedalltohell,"Fwiw that 42% number came from a really sketchy study, where they simply asked transgender people “have you ever considered suicide?”."
352,Nibbana0,"Get that but this isn't about them, they sold out females, it's about fighting against all that too. It's not easy. They
 piss me off too. No different than women who go along with pro-life to side with right wing men, but they still benefit from feminism AND legal safe abortion. Honestly my biggest fear in all this on an existential level are the newest generations of girls not ever understanding why they're oppressed, deprived of their own language and identity, only existing to serve males and other ""women"". You know those superior women who are super strong , never get pregnant and are rarely reported or prosecuted because it's she said/she said."
353,denverkris,"\> the vitriol...they hurled at US makes me feel...angry  

No, not me. Most detrans people are young adults, at best. They got caught up in this stuff when they were kids. It's not their fault, someone should have protected them, there's a reason why we don't let kids make life altering decisions."
354,bamzoombled,"I don't think it matters what platform it's from, the mods allow it."
355,Lady_Montgomery,"Ah okay. So everything else with transgenders, it's an exaggeration. Go to any high school, ask every kid there, have you ever contemplated suicide, now those numbers would be truly shocking. Wonder what they would make of those numbers."
356,Nibbana0,"How many women are going to report they were raped by their roommates, in showers, lockers, shelters, if they can be charged with discrimination for doing it and of course knowing they have to face MORE TIMs in those same spaces?

357,griffxx,"I was thinking about that myself, in light of the Vaping Crisis. But the TRAs would never allow a wait time until 21. And they would making it mandatory to see a psychologist, would be Gatekeeping.

* Someone who accidentally misgenders them.
* Someone who doesn't want to have sex with them.
* Someone who doesn't want a male healthcare worker touching their genitals due to abuse by males.
* Someone who is fleeing an abusive relationship with a male and doesn't want to share a bunk with a male.
* A child who accidentally refers to someone as ""him"" because they don't know what trans is.

Lesbians are lesbians because they're into women who have vaginas. Women don't have penises, so of course, lesbians would be completely put off by a man.

Women also have the right to defend themselves if they are subject to un-wanted sexual attention, especially in their own homes. No one is allowed to predate on women's bodies, no matter how entitled they think they are.  'Stealthing' someone into sex is rape. Full stop."

The issue is more that this way of trapping people with guilt and ostracizing within their own community if they don’t have unwanted sex is reminiscent of the tactics rapists use and makes me terrified to date someone for fear that I won’t know they’re trans and will be guilted into sex with a penis."

It is caused by the lies that a delusional person decided to partake in, not by anti-gay hate."

The only place I've heard of people not being called *real women* is in Arab sources about western women, and that comes up sometimes recently as well. That's because women in their culture have very strict boundaries if behaviour they have to fit between and can be made ""not real women"" in their own society if they step outside them.

Ever notice that AGPs love using crap logic that would be dismantled in a Philosophy 101 class?

Dave Muscato uses composition fallacies like ""a woman can be infertile and have PCOS and lose her hair and be exclusively gynephilic and still be a woman, therefore I'm a woman.""  Never mind the incel rants Dave was posting in 2009 about how women were ""shallow"" and didn't want him.  See also:

* ""It's my penis and I'm a woman, therefore it's a feminine penis."" 

*  ""Cis women are more aroused by the thought of looking good, therefore masturbating in my [sister's | daughter's] panties means I'm a woman.  Checkmate Blanchard!""

* ""Some traditional cultures have a third gender for HSTS and GNC gay men, therefore a gynephilic man crossdressing is just continuing a tradition.""

*  Logic from \/r/MtF when Nicole the Pedo met a linebacker with obvious autogynephilia: ""Cis men like JoeySalads wearing a dress to make a point are bad, but lack of dysphoria and no attempt to look like a woman doesn't make someone any less valid than the most passing trans woman.""

* ""Women, what would you do differently if all men had a 9 pm curfew?  Also, looking exactly like a man doesn't make me any less of a woman.""  --Dave Muscato

Not saying TIMs dont get beat up but it's usually because they are in the sex or drug trade or both.

And if they could meet Napoleon himself, on the one hand they would admire him on the other hand they may hate and resent him because he is the real deal."

IF every person in the world, who had something in their body that they detested (or just wished it was like other's bodies)*, focused on that part, on changing it, on modifying it so that others would see what they wanted, a lot of people would need intensive mental health care, or they'd commit suicide.

""Bio bitch"" jhc, they are hateful scum."
788,tinycommunist,"ignoring the probably-troll bio bitch comment, it's a sign of very serious hospital mismanagement if you have to frequently cancel one long planned surgical procedure (ftm top surgery) for other less-planned but statistically predictable procedures (cancer-related double mastectomies)

ESPECIALLY considering how rare it is for one surgeon to be an expert in both. it's an entirely different skill set. do they have reconstructive/cosmetic surgeons doing tumour removals? yikes. do they have surgical oncologists doing top surgery? double yikes"
789,tinycommunist,it's evil to be upset about having your medical procedures cancelled?
790,emy_trap,Yeah. I have no problem believing the person thinks that but I seriously doubt its a popular idea among trans people.
791,tinycommunist,"if this were routinely and naturally a zero sum game id agree, but it's poor and possibly dangerous hospital mismanagement that they're substitute procedures.

the same doctors should NOT be doing top surgeries and cancer related double mastectomies. either top surgery patients are going to be fucked over because their surgeon isn't used to reconstruction and gives them a no nipples cancer chest, or cancer patients are going to be fucked over because their surgeon isn't used to dealing with cancer and doesn't remove all the tissue.

it's like if therapy appointments were being cancelled for physiotherapy. is being able to walk more important than finally crying over your childhood pet? probably. should there EVER be a situation where they're sharing resources? heck no!

also, breast cancer rates are fairly stable and any good hospital should have the capacity to predict cases per month-or-so and have resources available"
792,n2R3aJVUhTt6zFgk,Welcome to social healthcare. Shits fucked.
793,AcceptableReference7,"No. What *is* evil, though, is to lash out against people whose procedure is objectively way more urgent than yours."
794,Tabitha88888888,"I'm referring to the comment at the bottom I'm sure you can see that. But okay having said that,as far as the surgery itself I'm sure it could be and would be rescheduled. It's not permanent. Second, maybe I'm different but speaking for myself as a Woman, a Person, if that was the explanation given to me why my surgery was rescheduled I would be understanding. 


Cancer is serious and no joke. Though I may not know the people I would have enough compassion for others to understand and adjust and reschedule my surgery even if it meant choosing another physician. If you have the resources to do this surgery anyway it should not be a problem. 


The comment made shows this is more about this person feeling angry and entitled that someone would have the nerve to deny them and they don't care why. Smacks of selfishness, entitlement and lack of compassion for others. Which interestingly enough many of these people have been and are being accused of."
795,Manaxium,"Whether that’s all fair and true or not, the message here is very clearly “our plight is equal or greater to cancer and your cancer treatment mismanagement isn’t our problem” which is ... tone deaf, to be charitable. 

Dysphoria is hard. Being trans is hard. Not being able to get affirming treatment is hard. The sum of those parts leads to tragic suicides. But in context, having affirming treatment *delayed* to prioritize emergency cancer treatments is a no brainer and apples to oranges in degree of urgency.

But I’m just a lost little truscum, what do I know 🤷🏻‍♀️"
796,IndependentRadio,Still a shitload better than the healthcare in the US tho.
797,tinycommunist,im not sure what you mean by that- do you mean government funded healthcare?

800,n2R3aJVUhTt6zFgk,Like Canada or the UK. Wait times are atrocious and long held appointments get bumped regularly with no reason given.
801,Tabitha88888888,"Perhaps, but there are those that do feel that way and have said it. Even if it is just words, words are telling about the thoughts behind them. Trolling is not an excuse. If it was racial let's say, very push button issue on social media ,troll joke or not, it would not have been received well. I sense you know this, and if you feel it is just a troll which excuses it in your mind why bother commenting or being defensive? It's just a troll right?"
802,Manaxium,"Okay, that’s being even more charitable, which is your prerogative.

But we’re not talking about a schizophrenic who is an immediate danger to themselves. We’re not talking about a mental health patient being denied intervention via therapy or medication. 

We’re talking about a mere *delay* in a procedure that is ultimately elective. For fear of the unknown quantity that is SRS trans people frequently delay or never get affirming surgeries despite the debilitating dysphoria they are suffering, and they do not make a dismissive huff about cancer patients stealing their doctors.

Again, you may be (and imo absolutely are) correct about where the real issue lies, but until that is sorted out by the administrative side of things, we’re still talking about trans patients crying that women with cancerous tumors threatening their lives *physically and imminently* are cutting in line with the available doctors,

World’s smallest violin. Dysphoria and cancer, in this context, are incomparable and it’s disingenuous to say these patients don’t feel they deserve to be as high of a priority as cancer patients. I have very bad dysphoria, I’m suicidal more days than I am not - the very thought that “okay, my date got pushed back, but I still have a date” would be more than enough to get me to hold on knowing the reason for my longer wait was to treat cancer patients.

This devil doesn’t need advocating. Go write a letter to management if they’re the cause. These trans patients are out of line under the current circumstances."
803,tinycommunist,"I live in the UK, and uh. nope. generally not true."
804,tinycommunist,"I mean it depends on if the troll is trans or not, clearly. Like, you wouldn't take a white person pretending to be asian online and writing anti black slurs as a representative of the asian community, right? So let's not use this obvious troll as a representative of the trans community. 

""Bio"" anything has not been a phrase used to casually refer to non-trans people in the trans community ever afaik."
805,tinycommunist,"What would you suggest people do when their mental health treatment is neglected, cancelled, delayed or administered poorly? Just shut up about it because some people have it worse? Ideal world everyone would just be okay with everything that happens to them, but it's not an ideal world and shaming people for expressing their emotions because ""someone else has it worse"" is shitty."
806,n2R3aJVUhTt6zFgk,"Really? So my daughters neurology appointment didn't just get pushed back *again* for the third month in a row?

I guess a 6 month old having 10+ siezures a day isn't really a problem.

Please, tell me more about how great our system is and how short the wait times are."
807,luckyme1315,I lived in Canada for 40 years and it’s absolutely  true there. I have so many friends and family members who were forced to wait years for important surgery. A friend of my mother’s had 95% artery blockage and was forced to wait 8 weeks for heart surgery. She was told to stay in bed and do nothing in the meantime not even open a door. The only good thing about Canada healthcare is that it’s taxpayer-funded.
808,,Like waiting 12 months to have CBT treatment of worse standard than  I could pay for ang get tomorrow?
809,Tabitha88888888,I never said it was a representative of the Trans community. You did. And as I live in a free country I can say what I like. Apparently  it bothers you for reasons that are now clear. Good day to you .
810,Manaxium,"Doctor: Yes, Patient Y? I’m terribly sorry, I know this surgery is important to you, but I’ve just had a cancer patient dropped in my lap who needs an emergency mastectomy before it spreads any further.

Me: I understand, doctor. I hope everything works out for your patient. See you on [new date]

???

Is this not how a reasonable person would react? Are trans people the only ones to ever find themselves in this predicament, or just the only ones to claim civil rights violations because my feelings hurt more than her cancer does?

I’m getting increasingly snarky, and I apologize because I mean no disrespect to my fellow dysphoria sufferers, but this seems to be a much simpler inconvenience being made out to be an affront to trans rights and safety. 

Nobody is *entitled* to elective surgery. And I don’t care what arguments some trans people are making, cosmetic surgery is **always** elective and adequate therapy for gender dysphoria should be addressing the necessity for those procedures and weathering expectations throughout the process.

 Not being able to survive a week longer for the procedure you’ve waited all your life for, *to save a life from a more immediate health crisis*, isn’t mental illness. It’s narcissism."
811,NW_Luna,"For one of my relatives with insurance, the wait time to see Neurology at an academic medical center in a large northwest US city was 6 months a year ago."
812,tinycommunist,"it's not perfect, the NHS is suffering from austerity and needs more funding BUT it's vastly better than having to pay out of pocket and go into deep medical debt (which you can do in the UK) and its not inherent to the system"
813,tinycommunist,"so an eight week wait that didn't kill her. how does that compare to either not getting the surgery or being in tens of thousands of debt?

the difference between for-profit and government medical systems is how limited resources are assigned

in a for profit system, the richest people can buy their surgeries immediately, people who can just about scrape or borrow the cash can get it eventually, and those that can't die

in a government medical system, people who need a heart surgery immediately get it immediately, people who can wait eight weeks safely may have to

i prefer the assignment of resources based on need, not financial privilege"
814,tinycommunist,you can pay for CBT treatment in the UK. we have a private healthcare market.
815,tinycommunist,"Okay so again, that should really not be the same doctor. Just mentioning that.

And I get not being particularly emotional, I'm also not, but some people just need to vent sometimes. Having a procedure delayed in that manner isn't just ""oh I have to wait another month/week/year"" it's ""I've lost the £35 I paid for my train to the hospital. I've used up my paid medical leave. My partner might not be able to help me recover in this different time frame."" It's a major disruption that it's okay to vent about.

It's also a good thing to make the public aware of, like all shitty things that can be changed with public pressure."
816,n2R3aJVUhTt6zFgk,Pediatric neurology with high seizure activity? If not then it's irrelevant.
817,n2R3aJVUhTt6zFgk,Its also suffering from being overstretched and quite badly organised.
818,n2R3aJVUhTt6zFgk,"I'd rather be in debt than dead on a wait list.

Plus, if not insured and paying cash in the states you pay a fraction of what's on the invoice. Hospitals pump up the charges because insurance has teams dedicated to beating them down. Someone paying cash or a payment plan with no BS? They'll cut a deal.

Edit to add, if the US sucks so much (I'm in the UK by the way) why anytime there's a complex case people raise money to send the child to the USA for treatment? Maybe because of the cost involved they can afford the best people and the best research?"
819,,Yea thats what I said. You can pay for top surgery too.
820,Manaxium,"I already conceded that point, though I have to wonder if your solution is that we plant more transition doctors this season instead of cancer doctors. In a broad sense their expertise is the same whether they’re performing a mastectomy on a trans man or a cancer patient.

There are a few HSTSs that genuinely have unbearable body dysmorphia and can't stand being in their own bodies. They try everything to pass as women and understand that they ARE men and don't try to overstep their boundaries. Those are the trans women I will actually sympathize with.

871,RaspberryInk,">Personal identity- What is that?

Self-perception. A healthy ego is a normal part of our core psyche that we all have. How we perceive ourselves (""I'm this, and not that"") is what allows each of us to hold a cohesive sense of self.

For trans people, obviously part of their personal identity is gender. I'm not suggesting whether that's healthy or not, but it just is."
872,villanelle23eve,"That's a good answer. It's kind of a BDD view on trans identity, if they perceive themselves as a gender that they have neither of the other two things in common with. It's true that they have a gender identity, given that the other two criteria don't match up, I wonder if they're dealing with a lot of cognitive dissonance."
873,RaspberryInk,"I'm sure it varies quite a bit, but I think seeking constant validation is a symptom of cognitive dissonance.

Clothing has evolved a lot and men used to wear skirts and things like that before they became associated with ""femininity.""

I have a fascination with biomechanics from various hobbies so even before I knew anything about trans or this bullshit there’s massive differences between male and female bodies besides just organs and appearance. Drives me insane that everyone ignores the importance of bone structure. 

Example: It’s common knowledge in show jumping and dressage that men have a higher center of gravity than women do, so they have a by far easier time balancing on a horse. Hormones and SRS will never negate that fact."
914,redlilitu,"And even if they are asking for scientific evidence, the burden of proof is on their side, not ours.

If I thought someone was better than me or had something I wanted I would focus in inside myself rather than obsessing about them.

And you don't just see weird make jealously in trans but in incels too and their obsession with the almighty Chad. On subs like inceltears they actually think those guys must be gay because they go on about other men's bodies and abilities so much. Another aspect of it is that when women fight men will always say ""oh, she's just jealous of you"" even when it's completely inappropriate. My dad was a right one for that. I was the kid no one was ever jealous of but his answer to every social problem I had was ""they're just jealous"" when I actually needed some help to relate to people better. Now I realise men do this because that's how they are. When they fall out or take against someone a lot of the time it's jealously rather than not liking the person.

954,luckycat80,"There's a male associate at my local Target in CA who wears a skirt and tights every day. He's great at his job and (so far) I've never witnessed anyone pointing or laughing at him. Obviously I'm not always there but he works in the gaming/electronics dept. where a lot of men like to hang out. My husband loves going there to check out the latest games for his Switch so we've seen him pretty often, always rocking mid-calf length skirts and tights (he doesn't wear makeup or any other typically 'feminine' trappings). I think it's great that he's wearing what makes him comfortable. Honestly the first time he came over to help us with wireless plans, I didn't even notice he had on a skirt; my husband mentioned it after we left."

So this is why they constantly have to try to brainwash us into thinking we are the ones who are jealous of each other all the time.

Someone who ran out of her RA medicine and can’t get anymore 


Someone who is on heavy doses of immunosuppressants who had to go to the doctor and “risk exposure” due to an essential treatment needed

970,winewatcher,"I have Lupus and take Hydroxychloroquine - two pills twice a day. This is the prescription medicine that Trump shouldn’t have mentioned as it has not fully been researched in connect with the Coronavirus.  Now patients, doctors, and hospitals are hoarding it and you can’t get it at a pharmacy anywhere in the country. One pharmacy in s Florida told a Lupus patient that it might be six months before it would be available again to people like us. 

People with Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis who need this may suffer severe inflammation and pain, joint inflammation and some immobility (for me that’s back to walking with a cane but maybe needing two canes), problems with other organs like kidneys, heart, pleurisy in the lungs (I’m describing Lupus here with which I’m familiar), memory and other cognitive problems, etc. 

Some of us will have to go on corticosteroids steroids or even stronger medication like Methotrexate or biological. These all have awful side effects. We’ll be even more likely to catch infections like the flu, pneumonia, COVID-19 and less able to mount a normal attempt at an immune response. If we become so sick with Coronavirus that we have to be hospitalized and if there is a shortage of ventilators we will not be put on one.  Even if e’re 35 years old, not 65, we’ll be sent home to die. 

So tell me again how the special people and their pursuit of their fetishistic, delusional, caricature of womanhood is more important for Newsweek to write about than the story about how many, if not most, of the under 60 chronically ill are women, natal women, because many of those  chronically ill people under 60 have autoimmune diseases - the majority of which overwhelmingly afflict women.

I didn't love having to go to my doctor to get a script for the controlled substance I take and risk being around sick people. I don't think it's wrong to say that, but I do think it's silly and self-defeating to frame it as the wrongest wrong I've ever experienced or some shocking new development. I don't like that I have to spend $30 on an office visit every 3 months for a medication due to red tape, and COVID is just icing on the cake. Same for trans medicine.

By staying away from the hospital for her physio due to this virus, she gets the joy of further restricted movements and spasms returning that she'll need more meds for. I can't even go to her home and comfort her and help her move about and clean, because I don't want to accidentally give her something she wouldn't be able to survive.

But hey, let's think of the most oppressed ever trans beans who are voluntarily taking HRT or having their cosmetic, voluntary surgeries postponed so that dying people can have the beds. Their needs should come first, I mean, it's only 20,000 people who have died worldwide so far."

If you get sick, get in an accident, etc. you could very well end up dying alone in an overwhelmed hospital. 

It also made me think about pregnant women right now. They tend to get regular checkups and don't most now give birth in hospitals? I can't imagine the stress pregnant women must be feeling right now. I can't imagine being hospitalized due to cystic fibrosis complications right now. We're likely to run out of hospital beds for the sick with this virus later this week. That's not even accounting for people with other emergencies, who may also get infected in the process.

(This means that the USA is mostly unable to produce its own protective masks, gowns, goggles, etc (PPE) for frontline healthcare workers some of whom will due as as a result or infect and possibly kill their family members inadvertently). 

Governor Cuomo of New York State yesterday said that the Federal government sent New York 4,000ventilators. But they need 30,000. How, he asked, are they, the Feds, going to decide who the 26,000 will be who won’t get a ventilator and will die."

I’m terrified of getting sick and infecting her. I’m terrified if they run out of her meds. Our health system (I’m in The Netherlands btw) is a complete joke. And it took covid19 to find out. Third world countries and the refugee camps are even in a worse spot. All we can do really is hope this goes away quick and doesn’t leave a lot of damage behind. And I hate the ppl who pretend it just a flu and go out and pretend nothing is the matter. And those aren’t just young ppl either.

Everything you have said about the Netherlands could be said about America and about San Francisco where I live. I feel like the people in my city who take this the most seriously are the older gay men who survived AIDS, the lesbians who took care of them, and the heterosexuals who had gay friends back then. 

Yesterday, one of America’s greatest gay playwrights died of Covid-19. Terence McNally. Normally, the tradition is for all the lights on Broadway to go dark for one night to honor such a great person of the theater. But Broadway is already dark because of COVID-19."
1007,griffxx,"Not getting cosmetic surgeries hasn't caused someone to die. We live in interconnected global markets. This means that there is no shortage of estrogen or testosterone in these markets.

I met David Bowie for a moment with my best friend back behind the Hollywood Palladium after a concert in the early 1970s. In high school I went to a dance club for teens (most of whom were LGB although maybe not aware or out).  It was called Rodney Bingenheimer’s English Disco and was in Hollywood, California. One evening I met David Bowie’s wife there. We danced and she kissed me on the lips. Closed mouth but I was around 16 so you can imagine the effect. Another night British rock star Suzy Quattro was there! Danced with her too. This was the height of glitter rock music. Rodney’s was the epicenter of the glitter rock scene in America. Thankfully, the made-up trans and many fake gender identities and letters added to gay and lesbian (as the political and social movement was called then if it wasn’t still referred to as “gay”) did not yet exist."

Gc Radfems find the word Terf offensive, trans identifying people find the word “tra**y” offensive, and yet when you swap them out on memes one is somehow justified and the other somehow worthwhile. We don’t make memes like this about them because it’s dehumanizing. We don’t think trans people are sub-human, we think they’re misguided, dumb, or perverted, depending on the context. They get away with “jokes” like this because they latched onto a legitimate movement and managed to convince society that they are a mistreated minority.

Double interesting is that the older shows/documentaries will mention these sorts of details to emphasize the oddity of the killer, but newer ones often will not because that coverage would be ""transphobic"" despite that it would also be accurate.

If they are straight or bisexual they will need to use some form of birth control to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. As they go through menopause and their hair starts to gray, they go through the process of being ignored by men.

This is the lifecycle of being women in a Patriarichal and misogynistic and sexist.

These are things Trans women will never understand. They will always be outside the window looking in. The most they glean and understand are the gender stereotypes of femininity. Which is what they can LARP.

Like, okay, even if I fully accept that you're a woman, stfu.  No one was talking about you, and they didn't need to be talking about you.  If I post in a running forum about leg cramps, should I be expected to get bombarded with comments like ""not all runners have legs!"" and then be banned for not talking constantly about amputees?  And get dragged and doxxed for being ampuphobic?

1325,Vibrosphere,"Oger served two consecutive one-year terms as one of five provincial vice-presidents in the NDP. By the end of the second term all political capital had been used up and Oger failed to even be nominated. According to some, anonymous sources said Oger had almost no support inside the party by that point. According to Oger, he didn't even want the VP job because he wanted to focus on another run at the provincial seat for the district of Vancouver-False Creek.

Oger's close friend and ally, fellow TIM Catherine Jenkins is the long-serving president of the Vancouver-False Creek NDP association and Oger has served several roles on the executive for that NDP provincial electoral district which explains how he has now twice been nominated to run for the provincial seat but this doesn't seem to be the case for the larger federal electoral district of Vancouver-Centre where Oger has failed to be nominated and as far as I can tell has never served on the executive for the federal district NDP association. 

Oger was badly beaten when trying to run for the school board, was narrowly defeated in a previous election for the provincial seat, came in last out of three nominees when seeking  to run as the NDP candidate for the federal seat. Following this defeat Oger's normally active twitter and Facebook accounts went silent for a couple days then Oger complained about losing a hard fought battle and did not publicly congratulate or endorse the nominee.

While both the provincial and federal NDP have never commented on Oger's public antics, rumour has it Oger was encouraged to seek federal nomination in order to get him out of the province (promoting the problem out of the way, from the perspective of the provincial party)

Oger is now preparing for his second campaign for the provincial seat against the 2-term incumbent Liberal. I expect he won't do as well as last time. Reputation has been damaged by defunding VRR, perceived support for Yaniv or at least for Yaniv's cause, and generally ridiculous and toxic behaviour on twitter."

Newsflash, it is not true. Skinny fat is a thing, and when their metabolism crashes later when their testosterone eventually decreases, along with their hair line beginning to recede they are going to be quite dismayed, they deserve it. They will also deserve all the cardiovascular and other issues that come with it.
