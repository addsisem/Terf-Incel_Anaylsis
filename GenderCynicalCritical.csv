0,gendernormie,"Absolutely. Part of detransitioning and accepting womanhood for me was realizing the only reason woman has any connotations other than female human is sexism. You take away the biological definition of woman and all that's *left* is sexism.

Edit: Thanks for my first silver, kind stranger!"
1,Tweeders55,Well I have now been banned from men writing women because there was a meme of a 50's wife worshiping her husband by fixing dinner kneeling at his lap. Someone commented on how to be her and someone else responded to identify as as a woman. I responded be born a woman. Well that set a few TIMs brain on fire. I'm again a terf and according to the mods all trans who identify as female are female regardless. I was banned forever with the exception of reading and voting. So men writing women had TIMs more in mind than women with vaginas. Irony at its finest.

You do the math."
177,moonflower,"That's fair enough, but unfortunately they have already taken the word ''woman'' and trashed it. The dictionary will be updated as soon as they can figure out how to define the word without it being either a circular definition or a nonsense."
178,BarronIsAnAnchorBaby,"Trans women are something like 0.3% of the population vs about 50% for cis women, so based on the numbers you gave trans women already have an 11% higher risk. That's ignoring the fact that trans women victims are substantially undercounted as your own link very clearly points out. The number for all women comes from actual statistics recorded from every murder, whereas the number for trans women comes from advocates curating whatever news stories they can find.

Most trans victims will just be recorded as one sex or the other, with no record of them being trans unless they're publicly out and someone happens to mention that in a news article, and that news article happens to be published on the internet and then happens to be found by an advocacy organization."

180,bunnyday_,"Percentages aren‚Äôt always the best way to measure things. Especially in such a huge discrepancy in population size (women vs trans women). Like you said it‚Äôs .3% of the population, of course every additional number is going to make the percentage higher. 


Even knowing that they aren‚Äôt always accurately recorded, isn‚Äôt it pretty obvious that women are killed more? Like you really think there a few thousand trans women deaths that are just not being recorded?"
181,moonflower,"I admire your efforts to turn back the tide, and cheer for you, but unfortunately I have already retreated to the next line of defence which is to fiercely defend the word ''female'' ... they are coming for it and I'm not giving it up without a fight"
182,BarronIsAnAnchorBaby,"Yes, ""every additional number is going to make the percentage higher"", that's kind of my point?

If there were a few thousand trans women deaths alongside the few thousand cis women deaths, that would make trans women hundreds of times more likely to be murdered, not equally likely to be murdered. Do you seriously not understand how proportions work or are you just screwing with me?

It's not ""pretty obvious"" that cis women are killed more, given that I did just demonstrate that trans women are killed more"
183,bunnyday_,"I‚Äôm saying when the population sample is so incredibly tiny compared to a enormously larger population percentages don‚Äôt make sense as a metric to use. I know how proportions work, and I also know that percentages aren‚Äôt always the proper metric to use, such as in this case where one population is around a million or less, and the other is around 167 million. More women are killed every year than trans women. This is literal facts. And shit this is even going off numbers I spent ten seconds looking up, I‚Äôve seen numbers that show a higher murder rate for men and women than trans men and women but I have no idea where I saw them. Either way I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not important that 26 whole humans were killed in a single year, that‚Äôs awful and sickening. But if we compare it to the number of women killed it doesn‚Äôt really compare. 


Not to mention the root of all this is men being responsible for the *vast* majority of these killings of trans women, not feminists. The real focus should be on the males who commit these crimes, not radfems."

Being into trans doesn‚Äôt exempt you from these either because all trans people have either a male or a female body (they may well have mutilated it but it still remains either male or female).

Difference is, most people have gotten used to homosexuality.

The suggestion was Women & OFAB Persons. Not good enough for the OFAB TRAs, it had to be Gender Neutral across the board; which is how Women became uterus havers, menstrators, pregnant persons, gestators , birth person.

* Someone who is fleeing an abusive relationship with a male and doesn't want to share a bunk with a male.

It is caused by the lies that a delusional person decided to partake in, not by anti-gay hate."

The only place I've heard of people not being called *real women* is in Arab sources about western women, and that comes up sometimes recently as well. That's because women in their culture have very strict boundaries if behaviour they have to fit between and can be made ""not real women"" in their own society if they step outside them.

Ever notice that AGPs love using crap logic that would be dismantled in a Philosophy 101 class?

Dave Muscato uses composition fallacies like ""a woman can be infertile and have PCOS and lose her hair and be exclusively gynephilic and still be a woman, therefore I'm a woman.""  Never mind the incel rants Dave was posting in 2009 about how women were ""shallow"" and didn't want him.  See also:

* ""It's my penis and I'm a woman, therefore it's a feminine penis."" 

*  ""Cis women are more aroused by the thought of looking good, therefore masturbating in my [sister's | daughter's] panties means I'm a woman.  Checkmate Blanchard!""

* ""Some traditional cultures have a third gender for HSTS and GNC gay men, therefore a gynephilic man crossdressing is just continuing a tradition.""

*  Logic from \/r/MtF when Nicole the Pedo met a linebacker with obvious autogynephilia: ""Cis men like JoeySalads wearing a dress to make a point are bad, but lack of dysphoria and no attempt to look like a woman doesn't make someone any less valid than the most passing trans woman.""

* ""Women, what would you do differently if all men had a 9 pm curfew?  Also, looking exactly like a man doesn't make me any less of a woman.""  --Dave Muscato

* ""I'm nonbinary and identify as neither a man nor a woman.  Therefore, I belong in the women's bathroom even though I have five o'clock shadow.""  --Mx Nillin"

""Bio bitch"" jhc, they are hateful scum."
737,tinycommunist,"ignoring the probably-troll bio bitch comment, it's a sign of very serious hospital mismanagement if you have to frequently cancel one long planned surgical procedure (ftm top surgery) for other less-planned but statistically predictable procedures (cancer-related double mastectomies)

ESPECIALLY considering how rare it is for one surgeon to be an expert in both. it's an entirely different skill set. do they have reconstructive/cosmetic surgeons doing tumour removals? yikes. do they have surgical oncologists doing top surgery? double yikes"
738,tinycommunist,it's evil to be upset about having your medical procedures cancelled?
739,emy_trap,Yeah. I have no problem believing the person thinks that but I seriously doubt its a popular idea among trans people.
740,tinycommunist,"if this were routinely and naturally a zero sum game id agree, but it's poor and possibly dangerous hospital mismanagement that they're substitute procedures.

the same doctors should NOT be doing top surgeries and cancer related double mastectomies. either top surgery patients are going to be fucked over because their surgeon isn't used to reconstruction and gives them a no nipples cancer chest, or cancer patients are going to be fucked over because their surgeon isn't used to dealing with cancer and doesn't remove all the tissue.

it's like if therapy appointments were being cancelled for physiotherapy. is being able to walk more important than finally crying over your childhood pet? probably. should there EVER be a situation where they're sharing resources? heck no!

also, breast cancer rates are fairly stable and any good hospital should have the capacity to predict cases per month-or-so and have resources available"

743,Tabitha88888888,"I'm referring to the comment at the bottom I'm sure you can see that. But okay having said that,as far as the surgery itself I'm sure it could be and would be rescheduled. It's not permanent. Second, maybe I'm different but speaking for myself as a Woman, a Person, if that was the explanation given to me why my surgery was rescheduled I would be understanding. 


Cancer is serious and no joke. Though I may not know the people I would have enough compassion for others to understand and adjust and reschedule my surgery even if it meant choosing another physician. If you have the resources to do this surgery anyway it should not be a problem. 


The comment made shows this is more about this person feeling angry and entitled that someone would have the nerve to deny them and they don't care why. Smacks of selfishness, entitlement and lack of compassion for others. Which interestingly enough many of these people have been and are being accused of."
744,Manaxium,"Whether that‚Äôs all fair and true or not, the message here is very clearly ‚Äúour plight is equal or greater to cancer and your cancer treatment mismanagement isn‚Äôt our problem‚Äù which is ... tone deaf, to be charitable. 

Dysphoria is hard. Being trans is hard. Not being able to get affirming treatment is hard. The sum of those parts leads to tragic suicides. But in context, having affirming treatment *delayed* to prioritize emergency cancer treatments is a no brainer and apples to oranges in degree of urgency.

750,Tabitha88888888,"Perhaps, but there are those that do feel that way and have said it. Even if it is just words, words are telling about the thoughts behind them. Trolling is not an excuse. If it was racial let's say, very push button issue on social media ,troll joke or not, it would not have been received well. I sense you know this, and if you feel it is just a troll which excuses it in your mind why bother commenting or being defensive? It's just a troll right?"
751,Manaxium,"Okay, that‚Äôs being even more charitable, which is your prerogative.

But we‚Äôre not talking about a schizophrenic who is an immediate danger to themselves. We‚Äôre not talking about a mental health patient being denied intervention via therapy or medication. 

We‚Äôre talking about a mere *delay* in a procedure that is ultimately elective. For fear of the unknown quantity that is SRS trans people frequently delay or never get affirming surgeries despite the debilitating dysphoria they are suffering, and they do not make a dismissive huff about cancer patients stealing their doctors.

Again, you may be (and imo absolutely are) correct about where the real issue lies, but until that is sorted out by the administrative side of things, we‚Äôre still talking about trans patients crying that women with cancerous tumors threatening their lives *physically and imminently* are cutting in line with the available doctors,

World‚Äôs smallest violin. Dysphoria and cancer, in this context, are incomparable and it‚Äôs disingenuous to say these patients don‚Äôt feel they deserve to be as high of a priority as cancer patients. I have very bad dysphoria, I‚Äôm suicidal more days than I am not - the very thought that ‚Äúokay, my date got pushed back, but I still have a date‚Äù would be more than enough to get me to hold on knowing the reason for my longer wait was to treat cancer patients.

This devil doesn‚Äôt need advocating. Go write a letter to management if they‚Äôre the cause. These trans patients are out of line under the current circumstances."
752,tinycommunist,"I live in the UK, and uh. nope. generally not true."
753,tinycommunist,"I mean it depends on if the troll is trans or not, clearly. Like, you wouldn't take a white person pretending to be asian online and writing anti black slurs as a representative of the asian community, right? So let's not use this obvious troll as a representative of the trans community. 

""Bio"" anything has not been a phrase used to casually refer to non-trans people in the trans community ever afaik."
754,tinycommunist,"What would you suggest people do when their mental health treatment is neglected, cancelled, delayed or administered poorly?

756,luckyme1315,I lived in Canada for 40 years and it‚Äôs absolutely  true there. I have so many friends and family members who were forced to wait years for important surgery. A friend of my mother‚Äôs had 95% artery blockage and was forced to wait 8 weeks for heart surgery. She was told to stay in bed and do nothing in the meantime not even open a door. The only good thing about Canada healthcare is that it‚Äôs taxpayer-funded.

758,Tabitha88888888,I never said it was a representative of the Trans community. You did. And as I live in a free country I can say what I like. Apparently  it bothers you for reasons that are now clear. Good day to you .
759,Manaxium,"Doctor: Yes, Patient Y? I‚Äôm terribly sorry, I know this surgery is important to you, but I‚Äôve just had a cancer patient dropped in my lap who needs an emergency mastectomy before it spreads any further.

Me: I understand, doctor. I hope everything works out for your patient. See you on [new date]

???

Is this not how a reasonable person would react? Are trans people the only ones to ever find themselves in this predicament, or just the only ones to claim civil rights violations because my feelings hurt more than her cancer does?

I‚Äôm getting increasingly snarky, and I apologize because I mean no disrespect to my fellow dysphoria sufferers, but this seems to be a much simpler inconvenience being made out to be an affront to trans rights and safety. 

Nobody is *entitled* to elective surgery. And I don‚Äôt care what arguments some trans people are making, cosmetic surgery is **always** elective and adequate therapy for gender dysphoria should be addressing the necessity for those procedures and weathering expectations throughout the process.

 Not being able to survive a week longer for the procedure you‚Äôve waited all your life for, *to save a life from a more immediate health crisis*, isn‚Äôt mental illness. It‚Äôs narcissism."

762,tinycommunist,"so an eight week wait that didn't kill her. how does that compare to either not getting the surgery or being in tens of thousands of debt?

the difference between for-profit and government medical systems is how limited resources are assigned

in a for profit system, the richest people can buy their surgeries immediately, people who can just about scrape or borrow the cash can get it eventually, and those that can't die

in a government medical system, people who need a heart surgery immediately get it immediately, people who can wait eight weeks safely may have to

i prefer the assignment of resources based on need, not financial privilege"
763,tinycommunist,you can pay for CBT treatment in the UK. we have a private healthcare market.
764,tinycommunist,"Okay so again, that should really not be the same doctor. Just mentioning that.

And I get not being particularly emotional, I'm also not, but some people just need to vent sometimes. Having a procedure delayed in that manner isn't just ""oh I have to wait another month/week/year"" it's ""I've lost the ¬£35 I paid for my train to the hospital. I've used up my paid medical leave. My partner might not be able to help me recover in this different time frame."" It's a major disruption that it's okay to vent about.

It's also a good thing to make the public aware of, like all shitty things that can be changed with public pressure."
765,n2R3aJVUhTt6zFgk,Pediatric neurology with high seizure activity? If not then it's irrelevant.
766,n2R3aJVUhTt6zFgk,Its also suffering from being overstretched and quite badly organised.
767,n2R3aJVUhTt6zFgk,"I'd rather be in debt than dead on a wait list.

Plus, if not insured and paying cash in the states you pay a fraction of what's on the invoice. Hospitals pump up the charges because insurance has teams dedicated to beating them down. Someone paying cash or a payment plan with no BS? They'll cut a deal.

Edit to add, if the US sucks so much (I'm in the UK by the way) why anytime there's a complex case people raise money to send the child to the USA for treatment? Maybe because of the cost involved they can afford the best people and the best research?"
768,,Yea thats what I said. You can pay for top surgery too.
769,Manaxium,"I already conceded that point, though I have to wonder if your solution is that we plant more transition doctors this season instead of cancer doctors. In a broad sense their expertise is the same whether they‚Äôre performing a mastectomy on a trans man or a cancer patient. It is **inevitable**, under any system, that a doctor qualified for both will book a surgery for a trans patient but have to push their appointment back following unforeseen emergencies where their expertise is required.

We can understand their valid disappointment without normalizing temper tantrums or ignoring the dismissive tone in how they speak about those cancer patients.

You‚Äôve made your points and I‚Äôve made mine, I don‚Äôt think either of us reached our feelings on this frivolously so shall we agree to disagree?"
770,tinycommunist,"overstretched is just another way to describe underfunding. demand is outpacing supply. increase supply.

771,tinycommunist,"it's because the USA healthcare system prioritizes life by wealth.

Also why would anyone need to live in misery? Just to bring someone to life that might or might not enjoy it? I would be a terrible mother. It wouldn't be righy for the kid to bring them to this world.

Trans ""women"" never try to empathize with the experiences of actual women. They don't listen. They try to project their own experiences and viewpoints on what it means to be a woman and say that that is the only way to be a woman, and that if we don't go along with it we're terfs, not real women, trans men etcetcetc

There are a few HSTSs that genuinely have unbearable body dysmorphia and can't stand being in their own bodies. They try everything to pass as women and understand that they ARE men and don't try to overstep their boundaries. Those are the trans women I will actually sympathize with. But most of them aren't like that and I am NOT going to make any accommodations for them, no matter how angry they get"

I don't know why this simple fact - that their experiences as males who want to be female are fundamentally different than the experiences of someone born female - is such a difficult thing for the majority of them to grasp.

842,RaspberryInk,">Personal identity- What is that?

Self-perception. A healthy ego is a normal part of our core psyche that we all have. How we perceive ourselves (""I'm this, and not that"") is what allows each of us to hold a cohesive sense of self.

For trans people, obviously part of their personal identity is gender. I'm not suggesting whether that's healthy or not, but it just is."
843,villanelle23eve,"That's a good answer. It's kind of a BDD view on trans identity, if they perceive themselves as a gender that they have neither of the other two things in common with. It's true that they have a gender identity, given that the other two criteria don't match up, I wonder if they're dealing with a lot of cognitive dissonance."
844,RaspberryInk,"I'm sure it varies quite a bit, but I think seeking constant validation is a symptom of cognitive dissonance. Some trans people seem to be able to be confident with their identity without external validation, where some seem *extremely* reliant on it. Same for some non-trans people in other dimensions of their life too, but it can't be easy to have a body that conflicts with how you see yourself."

Clothing has evolved a lot and men used to wear skirts and things like that before they became associated with ""femininity."" I'm a woman and I don't ever dress even remotely similar to what a drag queen would wear.

Even in fighting, the power generated is partly related to bone structure in the shoulders and hips. Trans people don't bother me and I'll fight for their rights to live happy lives without having to be scared of harassment and to enjoy equality under the law.

I have a fascination with biomechanics from various hobbies so even before I knew anything about trans or this bullshit there‚Äôs massive differences between male and female bodies besides just organs and appearance. Drives me insane that everyone ignores the importance of bone structure. 

Example: It‚Äôs common knowledge in show jumping and dressage that men have a higher center of gravity than women do, so they have a by far easier time balancing on a horse. Hormones and SRS will never negate that fact."
885,redlilitu,"And even if they are asking for scientific evidence, the burden of proof is on their side, not ours.

Absolutely consumed with envy like a madness. Like you say, I've never felt that way. In situations where these guys would feel insanely jealous I'd usually just feel sad or lose self esteem. If I thought someone was better than me or had something I wanted I would focus in inside myself rather than obsessing about them.

And you don't just see weird make jealously in trans but in incels too and their obsession with the almighty Chad. On subs like inceltears they actually think those guys must be gay because they go on about other men's bodies and abilities so much. Another aspect of it is that when women fight men will always say ""oh, she's just jealous of you"" even when it's completely inappropriate. My dad was a right one for that. I was the kid no one was ever jealous of but his answer to every social problem I had was ""they're just jealous"" when I actually needed some help to relate to people better. Now I realise men do this because that's how they are. When they fall out or take against someone a lot of the time it's jealously rather than not liking the person.

For example, I assumed the immediate priorities, if they were like ours (LG&B) would be the basics of wanting to not get beat up, raped, killed, sacked, or evicted, just for being (or assumed to be) gay. 

I expected to see the first big Trans campaigns of this era to focus on practical assistance for trans in or at risk, dealing with poverty, facing homelessness, violence, unemployment, poverty related risks eg physical/mental health, substance use, exploitation, sex trade bringing into contact w/police etc

r/nametheproblem has a steady flow of crimes committed by Trans women. WordPress.com account Women Are Human, also has a steady flow of crimes committed by Trans women.

All the crimes are sexual. They consist of rapes of women and children. Some of these crimes include violence up to that might be murders.

Sometimes it something seen as so  universally depraved that it is seen on r/news and r/worldnews. Case in point: 18 year old who had 13 sexual assault victims, all of them children with the youngest being 1 years old. After being in prison for 5 years, at 23 the state was releasing them because they had been on HRT for 2 years and were no longer a threat to anyone.

Then there are the ""conspiracy murders.""

It's important to remember that, as people, we deserve to be treated with respect, and that means taking our consent to participate (or not) in certain belief systems seriously. If I don't want to participate, that is as much a ""No"" that needs to be heeded as any other boundary. üòè"

1270,Vibrosphere,"Oger served two consecutive one-year terms as one of five provincial vice-presidents in the NDP. By the end of the second term all political capital had been used up and Oger failed to even be nominated. According to some, anonymous sources said Oger had almost no support inside the party by that point. According to Oger, he didn't even want the VP job because he wanted to focus on another run at the provincial seat for the district of Vancouver-False Creek.

Oger's close friend and ally, fellow TIM Catherine Jenkins is the long-serving president of the Vancouver-False Creek NDP association and Oger has served several roles on the executive for that NDP provincial electoral district which explains how he has now twice been nominated to run for the provincial seat but this doesn't seem to be the case for the larger federal electoral district of Vancouver-Centre where Oger has failed to be nominated and as far as I can tell has never served on the executive for the federal district NDP association. 

Oger was badly beaten when trying to run for the school board, was narrowly defeated in a previous election for the provincial seat, came in last out of three nominees when seeking  to run as the NDP candidate for the federal seat. Following this defeat Oger's normally active twitter and Facebook accounts went silent for a couple days then Oger complained about losing a hard fought battle and did not publicly congratulate or endorse the nominee.

While both the provincial and federal NDP have never commented on Oger's public antics, rumour has it Oger was encouraged to seek federal nomination in order to get him out of the province (promoting the problem out of the way, from the perspective of the provincial party)

Oger is now preparing for his second campaign for the provincial seat against the 2-term incumbent Liberal. I expect he won't do as well as last time.

But as soon as they open their mouth - the voice, tells. Their attitude when they're upset at work - tells. It's a bitter lash out at everyone around you, in a way that just isn't female. They're petty - even before I started working at my current job, I illustrated the tip jars with high quality gouache paintings (not to toot my own horn, but I'm a talented illustrator.) 

First, I only had one illustrated tip jar, which they moved to a different counter away from the register, and moved their's (literally a 0 effort written in paint pen on a coffee tin jar) where mine was. When the manager asked me to illustrate their seasonal jars, naughty or nice - their's got replaced. 

They were snarky, and would snidely harrass me  about it the entire time when it was first posted and when I first started working, because I was preferred. Got upset when I got more tips working the register as a hot girl. $20.00 three times already from guys who wanted my number. 

Literally anything I did while being bio female - upset them. I didn't get it because I had literally never spoken to them before meeting them - all they knew is that I was the bio female who others preferred over them.

Even things that are minor and like ""why would you even ever care"" bother them if they're rejected over it due to a bio female's; body, work, personality, genitalia, whatever. It's like a simmering of discontent - they want so badly to be seen as women, but when things don't go their way: the man comes out. I would consider them on the ""better end"" of the TiM scale, considering my experience."
1326,kallistothegreat,"Yeah, that's how I feel. I think it's important to consistently call out these ideas and show that actual lesbians are 100% not on board with this. Do I think transbians with giRlDiCks will care? No. But maybe the rest of the world will listen (before the TRA ideology gets to them)."
1327,winewatcher,And slavery. Don‚Äôt forget slavery.
1328,kallistothegreat,"Same. This might well be satire but it's not like it's anything we haven't heard before, so who is to say really?? The fact that there's any doubt about whether people could actually mean this seriously is honestly concerning."
1329,griffxx,"So it's finally out in the open: Genital Preferences ARE transphobic.

White Male Entitlement to female bodies and the demand that Lesbians/Bi/Pan females center them in their lives.

Welcome to the New Patriarichy."
1330,BlueBlackRedP,"That stood out to me too. That and whatever the bastardization of ""clittie"" is or something. Reading this while out and trying not to laugh or cry."
1331,jzerocoolj,"""men that fuck trannies are fetishists!"" said the fetishist, unironically."

1333,gayorles57,"Blatant cotton ceiling rhetoric, ew"
1334,ThisIsLifeJim,But it‚Äôs definitely not a fetish. Oh no no. 
1335,WotNoKetchup,"we have to play along with their madness

 otherwise they will smash the place up

the male in his man's world"
1336,peakingatthemoment,"What the hell is wrong with people. :(

You are some type of messed up if you force someone to do that for validation. "
1337,,I love trans people but these are the types that I hate. So fucking delusional. They fetish problems that girls and women have to deal with that is an inconvenience and usually not a happy experience. Fuck them

1339,DontDoxxMe_Bro,"Those poor nurses, forced by dint of their profession, have to play along in these sexual fantasies :("
1340,DontDoxxMe_Bro,"Saw a meme wherein a white guy gets angry and the drywall gets nervous. I‚Äôve seen with my own eyes men punch holes in the wall. 

Those poor nurses...:("
1341,DontDoxxMe_Bro,"I don‚Äôt hate transpeople despite what the lurkers think. I hate the way many co-opt and demand women‚Äôs narratives as their own with no regard or empathy for women. 

I think a tonne of GC used to be flat out allies but have been confronted by the way many transactivists behave in just misogynistic and violent ways, and then questioned where these policies would lead. 

I‚Äôve a colleague/friend who has transitioned (way back in the late 90‚Äôs) and she is also horrified by the new wave of transrhetoric."
1342,DontDoxxMe_Bro,Yep all to validate their feelings. Those poor nurses having to put with their delusions.

1344,Duckles000,"I understand where you're coming from regarding this topic.  
I accept trans people and I don't hate them, but I don't ignore cases where some of the more radical members do questionable things.  
Like there was a case when an MTF asked for a ""female genitalia"" massage and made a woman uncomfortable.  
So I got your back dude."
1345,DontDoxxMe_Bro,"I read the account of a transman on tumbler. It was a harrowingly sad account of how she wakes up every morning and cries cuz she misses her breasts. She‚Äôs determined she‚Äôs just a GNC woman, not trans and absolutely regrets her surgery.  I truly feel there are true transsexuals and we should support and lift them up, but these trenders are just repackaged pissed off men."

1347,lolhaxman,"If she's determined she's a GNC woman, then she is one.  She just made a mistake."
1348,lolhaxman,"Non-op/non-medical fluid here (the username is old), and there's an extremely valid point to be made about people doing unnecessary things to their bodies, but obviously I don't gel with putting gender in a box.

People will make mistakes, which is why I think beating back ideas that you need to be a specific medically-recognized type of trans with surgery or intense bodily dysphoria is good.  I completely agree that people often rush into things without proper information, and I think increasing visibility of people who don't want extreme changes to their bodies (which happens to include a lot of non-binary folk like me).  If not for really *having the definition of what being ""transgender"" even is* expanded for me, there's a lot about myself that I sort of knew but wouldn't have accepted."
1349,DontDoxxMe_Bro,"I‚Äôm a GNC older women, dysphoria in the sense that i felt it so unfair to be a girl; I didn‚Äôt get to do the same as my brothers, was told that I, as a woman should be subservient to men cuz we didn‚Äôt have natural intelligence, was to marry and pop out babies for God (Pentecost). I truly wonder if I had found this rhetoric back then I would have thought I was trans...,
Being born a woman is hard in this world; I think most of us want the same privileges as men with the ease that men move through this world. C‚Äôest la vie but I‚Äôll always stand with my sisters for our liberation."

1351,DontDoxxMe_Bro,Definitely got their idea of womanhood from porn. It‚Äôs enraging that they really think this bimbo 2D facsimile of Woman is a true representation of us :(
