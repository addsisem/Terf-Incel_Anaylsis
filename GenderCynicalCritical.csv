0,gendernormie,"Absolutely. Part of detransitioning and accepting womanhood for me was realizing the only reason woman has any connotations other than female human is sexism. You take away the biological definition of woman and all that's *left* is sexism.

Edit: Thanks for my first silver, kind stranger!"
1,Tweeders55,Well I have now been banned from men writing women because there was a meme of a 50's wife worshiping her husband by fixing dinner kneeling at his lap. Someone commented on how to be her and someone else responded to identify as as a woman. I responded be born a woman. Well that set a few TIMs brain on fire. I'm again a terf and according to the mods all trans who identify as female are female regardless. I was banned forever with the exception of reading and voting. So men writing women had TIMs more in mind than women with vaginas. Irony at its finest.

We ought to merge gay/lesbian movements with their doubly regressive/reinforcing values.

You do the math."
151,moonflower,"That's fair enough, but unfortunately they have already taken the word ''woman'' and trashed it. The dictionary will be updated as soon as they can figure out how to define the word without it being either a circular definition or a nonsense."
152,BarronIsAnAnchorBaby,"Trans women are something like 0.3% of the population vs about 50% for cis women, so based on the numbers you gave trans women already have an 11% higher risk. That's ignoring the fact that trans women victims are substantially undercounted as your own link very clearly points out. The number for all women comes from actual statistics recorded from every murder, whereas the number for trans women comes from advocates curating whatever news stories they can find.

Most trans victims will just be recorded as one sex or the other, with no record of them being trans unless they're publicly out and someone happens to mention that in a news article, and that news article happens to be published on the internet and then happens to be found by an advocacy organization."
153,Boingo0220,"They can't though. That's the thing. I'm keeping the word, language has power."
154,bunnyday_,"Percentages aren‚Äôt always the best way to measure things. Especially in such a huge discrepancy in population size (women vs trans women). Like you said it‚Äôs .3% of the population, of course every additional number is going to make the percentage higher. 


Even knowing that they aren‚Äôt always accurately recorded, isn‚Äôt it pretty obvious that women are killed more? Like you really think there a few thousand trans women deaths that are just not being recorded?"
155,moonflower,"I admire your efforts to turn back the tide, and cheer for you, but unfortunately I have already retreated to the next line of defence which is to fiercely defend the word ''female'' ... they are coming for it and I'm not giving it up without a fight"
156,BarronIsAnAnchorBaby,"Yes, ""every additional number is going to make the percentage higher"", that's kind of my point?

If there were a few thousand trans women deaths alongside the few thousand cis women deaths, that would make trans women hundreds of times more likely to be murdered, not equally likely to be murdered. Do you seriously not understand how proportions work or are you just screwing with me?

It's not ""pretty obvious"" that cis women are killed more, given that I did just demonstrate that trans women are killed more"
157,bunnyday_,"I‚Äôm saying when the population sample is so incredibly tiny compared to a enormously larger population percentages don‚Äôt make sense as a metric to use. I know how proportions work, and I also know that percentages aren‚Äôt always the proper metric to use, such as in this case where one population is around a million or less, and the other is around 167 million. More women are killed every year than trans women. This is literal facts. And shit this is even going off numbers I spent ten seconds looking up, I‚Äôve seen numbers that show a higher murder rate for men and women than trans men and women but I have no idea where I saw them. Either way I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not important that 26 whole humans were killed in a single year, that‚Äôs awful and sickening. But if we compare it to the number of women killed it doesn‚Äôt really compare. 


Not to mention the root of all this is men being responsible for the *vast* majority of these killings of trans women, not feminists. The real focus should be on the males who commit these crimes, not radfems."

You can be a bisexual in a heterosexual relationship in which case you are still bisexual, or bisexual in a homosexual relationship in which case, you guessed it, still a bisexual. Being into trans doesn‚Äôt exempt you from these either because all trans people have either a male or a female body (they may well have mutilated it but it still remains either male or female).

Gay men: general misogyny for women, not gay enough i.e. ‚Äúgold star only‚Äù for men

Lesbians: you‚Äôre doing it for attention or not gay enough for women, general (if deserved) distaste for maleness for men

Trans: mad that you won‚Äôt immediately date them for both genders, especially mad for women

And the more transgenders try to BECOME, the further they take themselves from the effortless ""is"" that is the natural woman they want to become; they try so hard, they are willing to ruin their bodies, their minds, their cultures in order to ""become"" - and the harder they try, the further they take themselves away from it and the more they become Frankenstein's caricature.

And so also this man will develop more and more rage and hatred towards women who simply ""are"", the more he tries to ""become"" one.

With the growing probability that there will be a steady flow of detransitionors, should this be considered a Trans Community Issue.

As Colin Powell said before the war with Iraq: ""You break it you buy.""

A major voice, is the daughter of the founder of 4 Wave Now. She has started an organization for female detransitionors.

I would really like to hear other people's thoughts on the matter."

The suggestion was Women & OFAB Persons. Not good enough for the OFAB TRAs, it had to be Gender Neutral across the board; which is how Women became uterus havers, menstrators, pregnant persons, gestators , birth person.

They have been actively involved in FEMALE ERASURE. The next attack was against the North American Midwives Association and the Doulas.

Honestly my biggest fear in all this on an existential level are the newest generations of girls not ever understanding why they're oppressed, deprived of their own language and identity, only existing to serve males and other ""women"".

* Someone who is fleeing an abusive relationship with a male and doesn't want to share a bunk with a male.

The only place I've heard of people not being called *real women* is in Arab sources about western women, and that comes up sometimes recently as well. That's because women in their culture have very strict boundaries if behaviour they have to fit between and can be made ""not real women"" in their own society if they step outside them.

Ever notice that AGPs love using crap logic that would be dismantled in a Philosophy 101 class?

Dave Muscato uses composition fallacies like ""a woman can be infertile and have PCOS and lose her hair and be exclusively gynephilic and still be a woman, therefore I'm a woman.""  Never mind the incel rants Dave was posting in 2009 about how women were ""shallow"" and didn't want him.  See also:

* ""It's my penis and I'm a woman, therefore it's a feminine penis."" 

*  ""Cis women are more aroused by the thought of looking good, therefore masturbating in my [sister's | daughter's] panties means I'm a woman.  Checkmate Blanchard!""

* ""Some traditional cultures have a third gender for HSTS and GNC gay men, therefore a gynephilic man crossdressing is just continuing a tradition.""

*  Logic from \/r/MtF when Nicole the Pedo met a linebacker with obvious autogynephilia: ""Cis men like JoeySalads wearing a dress to make a point are bad, but lack of dysphoria and no attempt to look like a woman doesn't make someone any less valid than the most passing trans woman.""

* ""Women, what would you do differently if all men had a 9 pm curfew?  Also, looking exactly like a man doesn't make me any less of a woman.""  --Dave Muscato

* ""I'm nonbinary and identify as neither a man nor a woman.  Therefore, I belong in the women's bathroom even though I have five o'clock shadow.""  --Mx Nillin"

Not saying TIMs dont get beat up but it's usually because they are in the sex or drug trade or both.

Which, I suppose, is synonymous with the feminine anyways."
664,greek_to_me,This reminds me of my male cousin who used to always have an OB tampon on his person 'in case he got shot and needed to stop the bleeding.'  (Really to impress women.)  Why else would a man be carrying tampons?
665,ashlily05,"where do they think the word feminine derived from?  it literally means of or relating to females so periods, tampons, pads, etc. could not be more feminine.  it is inherently female & feminine"

667,Tabitha88888888,"Because using men's products you know you are a Woman. They, using feminine products have to keep up the illusion they are women.

 But, if they want to be Napoleon and know they aren't and desperately want to keep that illusion, anything that breaks it threatens it.

They may even resent and hate you because you remind them they are not Napoleon and/or you tell them they aren't and can never be Napoleon. 

And if they could meet Napoleon himself, on the one hand they would admire him on the other hand they may hate and resent him because he is the real deal."

Then they got hip to the reality that over the course of a period, there can be different flow rate. So they used different pastel colored packages for pad and tampon colors. It was like a monthly Easter Basket."

788,tinycommunist,"ignoring the probably-troll bio bitch comment, it's a sign of very serious hospital mismanagement if you have to frequently cancel one long planned surgical procedure (ftm top surgery) for other less-planned but statistically predictable procedures (cancer-related double mastectomies)

ESPECIALLY considering how rare it is for one surgeon to be an expert in both. it's an entirely different skill set. do they have reconstructive/cosmetic surgeons doing tumour removals? yikes. do they have surgical oncologists doing top surgery? double yikes"
789,tinycommunist,it's evil to be upset about having your medical procedures cancelled?
790,emy_trap,Yeah. I have no problem believing the person thinks that but I seriously doubt its a popular idea among trans people.
791,tinycommunist,"if this were routinely and naturally a zero sum game id agree, but it's poor and possibly dangerous hospital mismanagement that they're substitute procedures.

the same doctors should NOT be doing top surgeries and cancer related double mastectomies. either top surgery patients are going to be fucked over because their surgeon isn't used to reconstruction and gives them a no nipples cancer chest, or cancer patients are going to be fucked over because their surgeon isn't used to dealing with cancer and doesn't remove all the tissue.

it's like if therapy appointments were being cancelled for physiotherapy. is being able to walk more important than finally crying over your childhood pet? probably. should there EVER be a situation where they're sharing resources? heck no!

also, breast cancer rates are fairly stable and any good hospital should have the capacity to predict cases per month-or-so and have resources available"

It's not permanent. Second, maybe I'm different but speaking for myself as a Woman, a Person, if that was the explanation given to me why my surgery was rescheduled I would be understanding. 


Cancer is serious and no joke. Though I may not know the people I would have enough compassion for others to understand and adjust and reschedule my surgery even if it meant choosing another physician. If you have the resources to do this surgery anyway it should not be a problem. 


The comment made shows this is more about this person feeling angry and entitled that someone would have the nerve to deny them and they don't care why. Smacks of selfishness, entitlement and lack of compassion for others. Which interestingly enough many of these people have been and are being accused of."
795,Manaxium,"Whether that‚Äôs all fair and true or not, the message here is very clearly ‚Äúour plight is equal or greater to cancer and your cancer treatment mismanagement isn‚Äôt our problem‚Äù which is ... tone deaf, to be charitable. 

Dysphoria is hard. Being trans is hard. Not being able to get affirming treatment is hard. The sum of those parts leads to tragic suicides. But in context, having affirming treatment *delayed* to prioritize emergency cancer treatments is a no brainer and apples to oranges in degree of urgency.

801,Tabitha88888888,"Perhaps, but there are those that do feel that way and have said it. Even if it is just words, words are telling about the thoughts behind them. Trolling is not an excuse. If it was racial let's say, very push button issue on social media ,troll joke or not, it would not have been received well. I sense you know this, and if you feel it is just a troll which excuses it in your mind why bother commenting or being defensive? It's just a troll right?"
802,Manaxium,"Okay, that‚Äôs being even more charitable, which is your prerogative.

But we‚Äôre not talking about a schizophrenic who is an immediate danger to themselves. We‚Äôre not talking about a mental health patient being denied intervention via therapy or medication. 

We‚Äôre talking about a mere *delay* in a procedure that is ultimately elective. For fear of the unknown quantity that is SRS trans people frequently delay or never get affirming surgeries despite the debilitating dysphoria they are suffering, and they do not make a dismissive huff about cancer patients stealing their doctors.

Again, you may be (and imo absolutely are) correct about where the real issue lies, but until that is sorted out by the administrative side of things, we‚Äôre still talking about trans patients crying that women with cancerous tumors threatening their lives *physically and imminently* are cutting in line with the available doctors,

World‚Äôs smallest violin. Dysphoria and cancer, in this context, are incomparable and it‚Äôs disingenuous to say these patients don‚Äôt feel they deserve to be as high of a priority as cancer patients. I have very bad dysphoria, I‚Äôm suicidal more days than I am not - the very thought that ‚Äúokay, my date got pushed back, but I still have a date‚Äù would be more than enough to get me to hold on knowing the reason for my longer wait was to treat cancer patients.

This devil doesn‚Äôt need advocating. Go write a letter to management if they‚Äôre the cause. These trans patients are out of line under the current circumstances."
803,tinycommunist,"I live in the UK, and uh. nope. generally not true."
804,tinycommunist,"I mean it depends on if the troll is trans or not, clearly. Like, you wouldn't take a white person pretending to be asian online and writing anti black slurs as a representative of the asian community, right? So let's not use this obvious troll as a representative of the trans community. 

""Bio"" anything has not been a phrase used to casually refer to non-trans people in the trans community ever afaik."
805,tinycommunist,"What would you suggest people do when their mental health treatment is neglected, cancelled, delayed or administered poorly?

807,luckyme1315,I lived in Canada for 40 years and it‚Äôs absolutely  true there. I have so many friends and family members who were forced to wait years for important surgery. A friend of my mother‚Äôs had 95% artery blockage and was forced to wait 8 weeks for heart surgery. She was told to stay in bed and do nothing in the meantime not even open a door. The only good thing about Canada healthcare is that it‚Äôs taxpayer-funded.

810,Manaxium,"Doctor: Yes, Patient Y? I‚Äôm terribly sorry, I know this surgery is important to you, but I‚Äôve just had a cancer patient dropped in my lap who needs an emergency mastectomy before it spreads any further.

Me: I understand, doctor. I hope everything works out for your patient. See you on [new date]

???

Is this not how a reasonable person would react? Are trans people the only ones to ever find themselves in this predicament, or just the only ones to claim civil rights violations because my feelings hurt more than her cancer does?

I‚Äôm getting increasingly snarky, and I apologize because I mean no disrespect to my fellow dysphoria sufferers, but this seems to be a much simpler inconvenience being made out to be an affront to trans rights and safety. 

Nobody is *entitled* to elective surgery. And I don‚Äôt care what arguments some trans people are making, cosmetic surgery is **always** elective and adequate therapy for gender dysphoria should be addressing the necessity for those procedures and weathering expectations throughout the process.

 Not being able to survive a week longer for the procedure you‚Äôve waited all your life for, *to save a life from a more immediate health crisis*, isn‚Äôt mental illness. It‚Äôs narcissism."

the difference between for-profit and government medical systems is how limited resources are assigned

in a for profit system, the richest people can buy their surgeries immediately, people who can just about scrape or borrow the cash can get it eventually, and those that can't die

in a government medical system, people who need a heart surgery immediately get it immediately, people who can wait eight weeks safely may have to

We can understand their valid disappointment without normalizing temper tantrums or ignoring the dismissive tone in how they speak about those cancer patients.

Self-perception. A healthy ego is a normal part of our core psyche that we all have. How we perceive ourselves (""I'm this, and not that"") is what allows each of us to hold a cohesive sense of self.

For trans people, obviously part of their personal identity is gender. I'm not suggesting whether that's healthy or not, but it just is."
872,villanelle23eve,"That's a good answer. It's kind of a BDD view on trans identity, if they perceive themselves as a gender that they have neither of the other two things in common with.

952,throwaway275445,"One thing I've really started believing since getting into this debate is that men get far more jealous than women and actually feel jealously much more keenly. Absolutely consumed with envy like a madness. Like you say, I've never felt that way. In situations where these guys would feel insanely jealous I'd usually just feel sad or lose self esteem. If I thought someone was better than me or had something I wanted I would focus in inside myself rather than obsessing about them.

And you don't just see weird make jealously in trans but in incels too and their obsession with the almighty Chad. On subs like inceltears they actually think those guys must be gay because they go on about other men's bodies and abilities so much. Another aspect of it is that when women fight men will always say ""oh, she's just jealous of you"" even when it's completely inappropriate. My dad was a right one for that. I was the kid no one was ever jealous of but his answer to every social problem I had was ""they're just jealous"" when I actually needed some help to relate to people better. Now I realise men do this because that's how they are. When they fall out or take against someone a lot of the time it's jealously rather than not liking the person. 

I know this isn't pure GC but it's coming up again and again and I don't think it's just socialization."
953,Tweeders55,Of course he didn't. Also those psychiatrists make more money pushing this you were born with a female brain crap. Big pharma is raking in the hormone therepy dough. It's a business.

Obviously I'm not always there but he works in the gaming/electronics dept. where a lot of men like to hang out. My husband loves going there to check out the latest games for his Switch so we've seen him pretty often, always rocking mid-calf length skirts and tights (he doesn't wear makeup or any other typically 'feminine' trappings).

So this is why they constantly have to try to brainwash us into thinking we are the ones who are jealous of each other all the time.

Now patients, doctors, and hospitals are hoarding it and you can‚Äôt get it at a pharmacy anywhere in the country. One pharmacy in s Florida told a Lupus patient that it might be six months before it would be available again to people like us. 

People with Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis who need this may suffer severe inflammation and pain, joint inflammation and some immobility (for me that‚Äôs back to walking with a cane but maybe needing two canes), problems with other organs like kidneys, heart, pleurisy in the lungs (I‚Äôm describing Lupus here with which I‚Äôm familiar), memory and other cognitive problems, etc. 

Some of us will have to go on corticosteroids steroids or even stronger medication like Methotrexate or biological. These all have awful side effects. We‚Äôll be even more likely to catch infections like the flu, pneumonia, COVID-19 and less able to mount a normal attempt at an immune response. If we become so sick with Coronavirus that we have to be hospitalized and if there is a shortage of ventilators we will not be put on one.  Even if e‚Äôre 35 years old, not 65, we‚Äôll be sent home to die. 

So tell me again how the special people and their pursuit of their fetishistic, delusional, caricature of womanhood is more important for Newsweek to write about than the story about how many, if not most, of the under 60 chronically ill are women, natal women, because many of those  chronically ill people under 60 have autoimmune diseases - the majority of which overwhelmingly afflict women.

I don't like that I have to spend $30 on an office visit every 3 months for a medication due to red tape, and COVID is just icing on the cake. Same for trans medicine.

By staying away from the hospital for her physio due to this virus, she gets the joy of further restricted movements and spasms returning that she'll need more meds for. I can't even go to her home and comfort her and help her move about and clean, because I don't want to accidentally give her something she wouldn't be able to survive.

But hey, let's think of the most oppressed ever trans beans who are voluntarily taking HRT or having their cosmetic, voluntary surgeries postponed so that dying people can have the beds. Their needs should come first, I mean, it's only 20,000 people who have died worldwide so far."

It also made me think about pregnant women right now. They tend to get regular checkups and don't most now give birth in hospitals? I can't imagine the stress pregnant women must be feeling right now. I can't imagine being hospitalized due to cystic fibrosis complications right now. We're likely to run out of hospital beds for the sick with this virus later this week. That's not even accounting for people with other emergencies, who may also get infected in the process.

(This means that the USA is mostly unable to produce its own protective masks, gowns, goggles, etc (PPE) for frontline healthcare workers some of whom will due as as a result or infect and possibly kill their family members inadvertently). 

Governor Cuomo of New York State yesterday said that the Federal government sent New York 4,000ventilators. But they need 30,000. How, he asked, are they, the Feds, going to decide who the 26,000 will be who won‚Äôt get a ventilator and will die."

Everything you have said about the Netherlands could be said about America and about San Francisco where I live.

One evening I met David Bowie‚Äôs wife there. We danced and she kissed me on the lips. Closed mouth but I was around 16 so you can imagine the effect. Another night British rock star Suzy Quattro was there! Danced with her too. This was the height of glitter rock music. Rodney‚Äôs was the epicenter of the glitter rock scene in America.

It also reminds me of when incels say that they are jealous of women because we can just ""have sex and even be paid for it whenever we want"" *because they just view it as the casual sex they fantasize about.* They either completely ignore or downplay all the risks of prostitution for the women forced or financially pressured into the practice and they definitely don't acknowledge that the sex is only pleasurable for the Johns."

1185,Literal_Violins,"Remember a few years ago when TRAS really ramped it up?  \[I think it was around about when USA had only just legalised same-sex marriage, and almost all the trans rights material was in American English\]

Maybe because the Trans activists went on so much about how their ""Trans Rights!"" campaign was exactly like ours, for Lesbian and Gay rights, the differences became more noticeable.

For example, I assumed the immediate priorities, if they were like ours (LG&B) would be the basics of wanting to not get beat up, raped, killed, sacked, or evicted, just for being (or assumed to be) gay. 

I expected to see the first big Trans campaigns of this era to focus on practical assistance for trans in or at risk, dealing with poverty, facing homelessness, violence, unemployment, poverty related risks eg physical/mental health, substance use, exploitation, sex trade bringing into contact w/police etc

1324,vulvapeople,"I thought Twitter users had to pay $1,000 to get a blue checkmark and that it's not based on follows, at least that's what I heard."
1325,Vibrosphere,"Oger served two consecutive one-year terms as one of five provincial vice-presidents in the NDP. By the end of the second term all political capital had been used up and Oger failed to even be nominated. According to some, anonymous sources said Oger had almost no support inside the party by that point. According to Oger, he didn't even want the VP job because he wanted to focus on another run at the provincial seat for the district of Vancouver-False Creek.

Oger's close friend and ally, fellow TIM Catherine Jenkins is the long-serving president of the Vancouver-False Creek NDP association and Oger has served several roles on the executive for that NDP provincial electoral district which explains how he has now twice been nominated to run for the provincial seat but this doesn't seem to be the case for the larger federal electoral district of Vancouver-Centre where Oger has failed to be nominated and as far as I can tell has never served on the executive for the federal district NDP association. 

Oger was badly beaten when trying to run for the school board, was narrowly defeated in a previous election for the provincial seat, came in last out of three nominees when seeking  to run as the NDP candidate for the federal seat. Following this defeat Oger's normally active twitter and Facebook accounts went silent for a couple days then Oger complained about losing a hard fought battle and did not publicly congratulate or endorse the nominee.

While both the provincial and federal NDP have never commented on Oger's public antics, rumour has it Oger was encouraged to seek federal nomination in order to get him out of the province (promoting the problem out of the way, from the perspective of the provincial party)

Oger is now preparing for his second campaign for the provincial seat against the 2-term incumbent Liberal. I expect he won't do as well as last time. Reputation has been damaged by defunding VRR, perceived support for Yaniv or at least for Yaniv's cause, and generally ridiculous and toxic behaviour on twitter."
1326,PassionateIntensity,No.
1327,Mother-of-Rats,I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him to pay for one.  Now that he‚Äôs no longer vp of the NDP and has to rely on his wages from Best Buy he can‚Äôt afford it.
1328,Woman-ThatIAm,"
If their partner is struggling while working on their masters, how about helping out in other ways. Take things off their ‚Äúplate‚Äù, that is not food. Run their errands, do housework for them, offer to run a relaxing bath for them, expend some emotional labor and talk to them about their struggles, fears, stresses: be a loving partner and friend! Just like they were for him when he dropped the bombshell of transitioning. 
Why is this so difficult? Oh, because they are a self centered, ego maniacal narcissist who believes their partner exists only to fulfill a fantasy for them, not to exist as a person outside them."
1329,csemege,That's a lot of emotional work to perform for dick she wasn't even into in the first place.
1330,loweryourgays,A man trying to control a woman's body and acting manipulative when she speaks up? Shocking.
1331,Woman-ThatIAm,"Oh, yeah, surprise, someone with male genetics is able to keep weight off easier, especially while in their 20s! I am shocked! There is no shortage of men who eat like crap, do nothing physically but maintain their weight but think they are the epitome of health just because they are not overweight or obese. Newsflash, it is not true. Skinny fat is a thing, and when their metabolism crashes later when their testosterone eventually decreases, along with their hair line beginning to recede they are going to be quite dismayed, they deserve it. They will also deserve all the cardiovascular and other issues that come with it.

I do doubt that this woman is eating as healthy as she thinks
For I myself used to delude myself until I started strict calorie counting, lowered my processed carbs, began eating lean meat, healthy fats, and lots of dark green veggies, and only drinking water. 
She probably could be healthier, but her ‚Äúpartner‚Äù is unsupportive at best and toxic abusive at worst. They are not helping their partner in the slightest."
1332,tinycommunist,"can you imagine the narcissistic rage that would happen if she told him not to show male secondary sexual characteristics because ""what would people think?"""
1333,bunnyday_,"Of course people made comments about her weight. She obviously knows she‚Äôs gained weight and even said she has been obese, why make the problem about that instead of the real problem?? I mean I know the answer, it‚Äôs just still baffling to me"
1334,,It's always the same old story with TIMs.  They are rude and nasty to the people around them and when confronted they make it all about them and their autogynephilia.
1335,pattismithshair,"Wow, I wonder if this story is true. If it is, that's some of the most blatant manipulation I've ever heard of."
1336,TranimeGirl,That is clearly abuse
1337,,[removed]
1338,all_the_people_sleep,"It says they were together when he was ""presenting as male"" so it sounds like she was straight or bi to begin with. But now she's a ""lesbian"" because he's ""presenting"" as female?"
1339,daughter_of_bilitis,I would be worried for her safety.
1340,Woman-ThatIAm,"I don‚Äôt doubt that it is true at all, because men(non TIM) do this sort of thing all the time, so, it isn‚Äôt a surprise a TIM would do it."
1341,cnemidophorus,"I‚Äôd guess so. The tactic of deflecting legitimate blame by making a counter accusation, assuming the role of victim, and then forcing the other party to comfort you is a very old and well worn one. Lots of women deal with that from immature men and it works due to empathy until you become cynical and wise to the game. Knowing this and in context to the verbal abuse of constantly tearing her down for her weight it rings very true to me."

Edit: Just realised you're an incel. That makes sense. That's why you hate fat women"
1344,anchovycupcakes,"This is one of the most demented parts to me, other than her actual demented narc boyfriend.

Edit: did a single person in the comments call them out for not actually being lesbians at all? Lol. 

I can't believe ppl say this stuff with a straight face in 2020. No pun intended!"
1345,csemege,"She‚Äôs said to ""reject a body of a non-cis woman"", so it sounds to me like she‚Äôs not into it."

1347,crispycherrypie,Nothing says first world problems quite like arguing about who is the most oppressed on reddit.
1348,montanagraey,Omg that is fucking hilarious.
