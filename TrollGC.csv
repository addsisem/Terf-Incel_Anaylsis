30,DontDoxxMe_Bro,"No not really. Male socialization is completely different than how we women get socialized. 

It happens from birth when our sex is OBSERVED. 

**Female is the only class that gets killed upon being observed as female**.   


*If you don’t see SEX you don’t see sexism*. 


But you come from traaaans so I doubt you’ll open your eyes, heart and mind to the suffering of women. Go away child and play with your delusions as the world burns."

Unfortunate people in a NEET position, I definitely feel sorry for, but someone who goes to great lengths to inflict unemployment on others is another thing entirely.

45,DontDoxxMe_Bro,"That’s wonderful frankly. I would honestly suggest doing some reading and YouTube work first! There are many lovely feminists on YouTube (peachy yogurt and Magdalena berns). I’d also start with the written works of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and Andrea Dworkin. Please go read the sidebar at GC proper. There are evolutionary anthropologists and endocrinologists on Twitter for resources therein. Our debate sub is where you would go for greater nuance on these difficult matters (not here kiddo, I’m one of the mods here and we’re creating a space for women that doesn’t stifle them or tell them they’re too angry or not funny etc all the shite that men tell us hourly). 

Good luck!"
46,LordPylar,"And of course, necessary when *I* do it."
47,Akumu01,Thanks for the advice
48,DontDoxxMe_Bro,"No worries. There’s also our r/detrans sub if you want lives from a completely different perspective TW there was a recent suicide alas alas. 

r/GCdebateTQ is the debate sub. r/gendercriticalcynical is another one if you want to see our lurkers in action. 

Seriously good luck, I hope you don’t do anything rashly but you’ve also got to think of what’s best for you as you move forwards in this body anchored in space and time. We have some good ally transsexuals on Twitter is you want to see the the difference is attitudes between TWAW and TWAM. Fionne is one such ally. There was another one, Jenn but the got kicked off twitter cuz he accurately described himself as male. There are some trans subs that say you need dysphoria to be trans but I’m not sure which one would be best honestly. 

You gotta think for yourself after all. I hope you use some of these resources"
49,Akumu01,Can I give you some feedback really quick?
50,DontDoxxMe_Bro,On what?
51,Akumu01,Your response to my initial comment

Meanwhile on GC posts we're all like.  Good, hopefully this will peak the normies so we can get our basic human rights back, I hope they don't murder her 'cause that would suck."
58,Frizzynoodles,"I'm sure I read once that she uses initials rather than her name so as not to put boys off from reading her books. It's not uncommon among female authors either.

It’s sadly a basic fact of reality that the biggest moneybags get the most attention. 

In this case her wealth allows her to speak and feel relatively little of the backlash. 
While we shouldnt underestimate the voice of average people, having a wealthy ally works in our favor here.

138,xScoopityWhoop,Males are gonna male.
139,QueenRowana,"I said this before but basically:

I see the most noticeable difference between TiM and TiF being that:

Trans'men' want all transmen to be seen as men. They want to assimilate into maleness. Even though they can obviously never truly be male, they try their very best to be as true to a real man as they can manage.



Trans'women' want all women to be seen as transwomen. They are not interested in assimilating into femaleness but instead want femaleness to change to fit them. They don't even try to be as female as they could possibly be, instead they cosplay and make a mockery of femaleness. But somehow they are the true women, not us.

They want to push real women out of femaleness and take our place.


Yes, TiF's and TiM's are both wrong and mistaken, Yes, Neither of them can ever be what they want to be, Yes, both will still always be the sex they were born as. But of the two groups it is clear the TiM's are the more dangerous group."

142,PollyannaPenny,"I noticed this back when I used Tumblr. The TiMs were quick with threats of rape and violence & profane slurs. But the TiFs would be like *""ummm, do you really feel that way about trans and non-binary people. That makes me sad. I feel uncomfortable reading your blog now :(""*

&#x200B;

Not surprisingly, the only time actual females resorted to threats & slurs is when they were playing shield-maiden for the TiMs (ie *""I'm a cis-woman!!! My best friend is a trans-woman and she's more of a REAL FEMALE than you and me put together!!! Go choke you TERF b!tch!!!!!""*). They never did it when defending ***themselves***; just in the defense TiMs and non-binary men. It's fucking sad that they don't see it"

147,tireddandelion,it’s almost like they’re not actual women
148,tireddandelion,it’s actually entertaining seeing TiMs yell on twitter @ “terfs” and then scrolling through their tweets and noticing how they always talk exactly like a stereotypical male.

217,,"Has anyone else noticed an increase in social pressure to *not* react with fear when a strange man is following you or approaching you? 

I’ve come across it online and IRL, men saying they don’t like it when a woman shows any concern or fear around them. It makes them feel bad if she looks over her shoulder, quickens her step, or crosses the street. The implication is that we should first consider the feelings of the man behind us before taking any precautionary actions. I’ve even heard people say that women acting like that is a microaggression against men. 

Mass gaslighting? I don’t even know."

I try not to be too judgey, I am not a small guy and I can look kind of sketch, especially in the dark."

226,Upper_Canada_Pango,"The last time it happened it turned out she was just trying to get my attention (30 minutes after we parted ways we ended up in the same shop  she tried to start a conversation with me which I ignored seeing as I'm not available and she was maximum half my age [gf calls me jailbait bait because this kind of thing keeps happening]) 

but especially when I lived in Toronto this happened a fair bit and the women displayed unmistakable,  genuine fear. My running theory is that they're probably not paying enough attention initially and then realise ""oh shit there's a guy right behind me""

It still happens sometimes now that I live in redneck paradise but not as much, presumably since I don't look as *relatively* sketchy compared to the general population. Especially in this neighborhood."

1. Being uncomfortable with my body: breasts, hips, etc

2. Being uncomfortable with the femininity that is forced upon women and not identifying with it whatsoever

3. Being uncomfortable with society's expectation of and treatment towards women. No, women everywhere are not looking to be baby makers, no women everywhere do not like getting hit on/harassed by random guys, no women everywhere do not like being submissive, in sex or life in general, women are not universally, inherently gentle, peace loving, feminine, kind, passive or any of the other traits ascribed onto women. Women are not all naturally flirty, girly and don't all love makeup - many don't care for it. No, women everywhere don't care exponentially more about their appearance than men do. Just because some women do these behaviors does not mean all women do, even if it makes us feel less individually ""empowering"".


Further, we must examine why so many women are entrapped in this stuff anyways. What are our cultural motivations for behaving the way we behave? And no, it is not condescending to question these things (in fact we should be questioning all sorts of decisions from all sorts of people, not just women)

Being uncomfortable with the subliminal messaging that relates society to women and vice versa is a phenomenon universal to women, I'd say. It doesn't mean you're broken and not a woman. And trying to go non binary isn't going to liberate you from that. I want more women to be aware of this."

Looks like we're back to only men being allowed to talk about our bodies. The pace at which we're losing things that we fought so hard to gain is increasing and the trans movement is what opened that door.

And as a more general note: Our political world is too binary as is imo, and unwillingness to come to educated conclusions based on all well-studied sides  only serves to radicalize those we disagree with and blocks dialogue. We cannot just rely on our own initial confirmation biases. One must engage with their perceived enemy and listen before drawing conclusions and adding our own voice if we want to get anywhere. This is a big issue I see in the trans community. They fail to respectfully listen to us when many of us used to believe in their ideology, and then came to different conclusions. Both left and right could stand to become a bit more tolerant of difference."

Sorry, I'm gonna call that out when I see it."
362,PollyannaPenny,"I can't help wondering if the original writer of the play has drunk the Kool-Aid and is going along with her creation being re-written to appease mentally ill transsexuals who are triggered by the word ""vagina""."
363,zubat-support-group,"Oh cool, it’s my alma matter. I’m in hell. You think a school with a 15% acceptance rate would be filled with more fucking critical thinkers. I am not surprised, though. Feel free to ask me questions tho, I know some folks who were in it so have a limited knowledge of the goings on."
364,jetpatch,"I wonder if this is why western men are so desperate to get in to women's spaces, they are used to being spoilt and centred in that kind of environment. They want a harem. Even in normal classrooms teachers  use girls to keep control of the boys' behaviour and the girls' results suffer because of it. 

You don't seem to find that same invading behaviour in cultures where single sex schooling is still the norm."
365,RAproblems,"To be fair, everyone who auditions gets in the show every year. The audition is just a formality/a time for your to practice speaking in front of others/time for the directors to get to know your personality before you're formally assigned a role. 

My understanding was that the directors (who were students) *sought out* TIMs to include after the fact as a virtue signal."
366,lindasenora,"Hear, hear.

Some people have commented that female athletes should refuse to compete against trans athletes, they should walk away from the area where the competition is held.

I don't know how many athletes would agree to do that, though"
367,RAproblems,I wish I would have been more wise back then.
368,jetpatch,They feel sorry for them. Women infantalise men and patronise them. By assuming men are lesser or incapable women end up giving men even more power and resources and shore up the very system which oppresses them.
369,zubat-support-group,"I’m not saying we should trust these outlets as sources on their own, but if we hold some views in common, I don’t think that destroys any validity of the point if the root of our argument as GC feminists is sound. Of course, that does not mean we must agree with the vile beliefs of those we may agree with on other points. 

A confirmation bias is the tendency to be more lenient towards data that supports your cause or comes from a source to agree with. So no, you disagreeing with an easily disputed and illogical thought process would still be backed by sound data, I’m assuming. 

I do agree that we should share and debate primary sources from trusted and reputable sites on this subreddit (something that we’re honestly not that good at), as spreading untrustworthy rhetoric does convey acceptance of the whole. And i for one am tired of being any mamma
“Good girl.” However, most of the debate on this thread was directly talking about the student newspapers that talked about these shows, not the right-wing response. Therefore I think this conversation is still worthwhile, even if the picture that prompted it is from a shitty source that personally I dislike too."
370,noisyasamouse,"Not exactly. Here's her statement: 

>So I was surprised to find that students at Mount Holyoke College have decided to retire The Vagina Monologues because they believe it is not inclusive to transgender students. Their statement reads, “At its core, the show offers an extremely narrow perspective on what it means to be a woman … Gender is a wide and varied experience, one that cannot simply be reduced to biological or anatomical distinctions.”

>The Vagina Monologues never intended to be a play about what it means to be a woman. It is and always has been a play about what it means to have a vagina. In the play, I never defined a woman as a person with a vagina.

>Inclusion doesn’t come from refusing to acknowledge our distinctive experiences, and trying to erase them, in an attempt to pretend they do not exist. Inclusion comes from listening to our differences, and honoring the right of everyone to talk about their reality, free from oppression and bigotry and silencing. That’s real inclusion — to listen to different stories, with curiosity, and love, and respect, in all their particular and distinctive human individuality.

https://time.com/3672912/eve-ensler-vagina-monologues-mount-holyoke-college/

I'm not sure how much of this is her trying desperately not to be thrown in the TERF bin, but even if none of it is, a lot of what she's saying goes against trans activism. And in any case it's very telling how TRAs interpreted ""Vagina"" as meaning ""women only"", almost like they know men don't have vaginas..."
371,noisyasamouse,"Did you notice any other TRA/libfem nonsense going on there that didn't make the news? People getting ""called out"" or ""cancelled"", women being censored, women's events and spaces being erased/invaded etc...?"
372,lindasenora,"I think being spoiled plays a part in this situation, but I think that being mediocre is a contributing factor.

These trans athletes know they will never amount to anything when competing against other men, and they saw a chance to get fame and accolades when competing against women."
373,CoffeeFaceMan,"I am a guy but I feel this is so true, this is how I’ve been treated by the women around me for my whole life and have subsequently played into it to get what I want. 

Fuck, I need to go and think about my life."
374,griffxx,S - N - A - P!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
375,zubat-support-group,"People didn’t get “canceled,” no. I do think that the population was too intellectual to fall to the strict cancel culture we see online. The college itself doesn’t have a woman’s center, Which to me is ludicrous. Women’s rights were really only mentioned insofar as the higher rates of rape and sexual assault faced by women. There was, in the same year, a high influx of women sharing their sexual assault stories and trying to get the university to pay attention. But there was a real lack of good and easily disseminated information on topics like women in STEM, being a woman in the workforce, ect...  

I’m not sure if there were ever any TIMs invading woman’s spaces (somewhat due to the lack of struck woman’s spaces). The sororities usually has higher up rules (at the national or international) level barring men from participating. (The university itself had incredibly sexist policies surrounding Greek life, but I feel like this is a convo for another time haha)"

566,LandisRiv,"Luckily we also have adults seeing sense and calling out putting children on blockers. Heck, we've even got people from the trans community saying how harmful it is putting children and teens on blockers, and they're speaking from a place of experience. 

Thing is, seems like the people who are most in support of this actually don't know any trans people, have no experience with any of this, don't understand the side effects, they're just voicing their support for likes on social media. 

Just because a kid plays with a stereotypical girl or boys toy does not mean they need to undergo surgery or take hormones."
567,apfrun,"One time on a forum someone asked everyone how they feel about kids playing with the ""opposite genders'"" toys. Some people replied saying that it was 'transphobic to not let them'. People actually think children know they want to mess with their body for life and that they want to completely be the opposite sex just because they play with a different toy. Literal insanity"
568,LadySparklz,The fact that Kira said this makes it even more valid ❤️
569,maitredestroy,Wild to me how some trans people like to assume children have made their mind up about what they want to fuck when they grow up?
570,TheHistoryMachine,Truth.
571,Manaxium,"There are a lot of people who find their identity and purpose in being a woke ally within trans rights actvisim, it’s a problem that causes some parents to be so open minded their brains fall out and start seeing signs in all their children that they’re trans. 

It’s a huge problem, but apparently pointing that out is violence now.

Throwing my endorsement behind the “even trans people see the issue with transing kids” comment, btw. Especially considering at the same time they’re pushing pediatric transitions they’re also saying there is no standard for who is trans. You can’t ask people to consider messing with kids’ development while saying there can be no “gatekeeping” to protect those kids. 

It’s all bananas."

A lot of women still don't have access to basic hygiene and period products, which can lead to medical, but also social issues. A lot of girls and women and missing out on education because they can't go to school while on their period, because of a lack of access to period products. A lot of women and girls are also suffering abuse while on their periods, because of misogyny and general disgust at female biology (look up menstruation huts). For all of these reasons it is important to speak up about periods, because women shouldn't have to suffer of this basic biological fact just because men would rather they shut up about it."

But I also know not all lesbians have (nor should they need to have) the same priorities as me in that regard, and I would certainly never advise another lesbian against dating a bi woman she was genuinely interested in, I would only be excited and hopeful for her. Not a single one of my bi friends would ever dream of cheating on a partner, male or female, and several of them even sway heavily toward dating other women.

Pedophile AGP TIMs are grooming young boys to become trans, to hate and resent their concerned parents and then convincing them to run away at an age where they cannot work to support themselves. 

These boys are groomed into satisfying the pedo's fetishes and to being the kind of trans girl they never could (because of puberty and age).

There are pedos out there collecting boys like this, offering a place to stay, with the expectation of sex.

I only know about this because a teen mtf told me his story and I asked around and realized it was not an isolated incident.

And besides these cases, there are plenty of old men encouraging much younger men and boys to transition into hypersexual imitations of girls and young women. That behavior is easily found in the trans social media. It is normalized pedophilia."

I think some people believe that it matters more than you or me do - maybe because (as other people have pointed out) they genuinely don't have bigger problems in life than combatting their own individualism.

The left can be just as Racist as it's White Supremacists counterparts. I can tell them and deconstruct Trans Ideology for them. And how they have tried to claim that biological sex is not binary but a social construct. Then I can emphasize that the Black LGBTQ weren't involved in any of this nonsense.

Assuming that additional categories besides men/women such as ""mixed"" or ""trans"" categories aren't acceptable:

If they are on hormones/surgery the answer is that **they shouldn't be allowed in professional sports at all**, in either men or women's division, due to the fact that they have unnaturally modified and enhanced their bodies and thus are given an unfair advantage: it's a similar argument as to why steroids and performance enhancing drugs disqualify people from professional sports. Hormones/surgery also disqualify transpeople from sports because they get advantages as a result.

However i love that article on the female olympic swimmer Ledecky who trained with the men occasionally and just completely left them in the dust. Meter by meter she started beating them and the men were exhausted and had to give up saying “your morale goes down pretty quickly when you get beaten by a female in practice. “

When an interviewer asked Ledecky about this she claimed she hadnt even noticed saying “ i was probably just concentrating on doing my own work. “

Just badass and the only way i will ever allow men to do a sport with women: to watch men’s confidence crumple as they are defeated."
1098,3lvy,Most of the feminist subs have been taken over by men.
1099,,"/r/wherearethefeminists

Edit: looks like it’s pretty dead these days, let’s revive it!"
1100,twoXfeminist,His comment history also has something about him sympathizing/holding MRA views.
1101,,If I recall correctly it’s not something he hides.
1102,,Actually the main mod of that sub is a man. I’m willing to bet other mods are too.
1103,IKnowWhatImAbout,Just a reminder for anyone reading that r/GenderCriticalGuys is a thing. It's a smaller subreddit but decently active and everything I've read over there seems reasonable.
1104,TheOGJammies,Lol Wow. Case in point y’all ☝️
1105,Taveing,What on earth are you talking about?? Good grief.
1106,,"Don't drive in a car, ride a train, or fly in a plane - people are LITERALLY DYING. . OMGZ it's not safe.  The car lobby is against us! GOVERNMENT CONSPIracy!

...if I sound crazy that's because all this nonsense is."
1107,twoXfeminist,"Not sure if you identify as a GC feminist but please leave, jfc. This is the kind of shit that ends up on GenderCynical with a caption ""Look, all GC feminists are antivaxxers!!!""

And also, please vaccinate yourself for the safety of others, especially those who are too young to receive vaccines and are vulnerable because of selfish lunatics like yourself."
1108,burntmatchesburn3x,Seek help.
1109,Lars_the_Leprechaun,There is a Trans Mafia on Reddit and it's a big problem.
1110,byefatlecia,Love you! 😘
1111,grass-fed_quinoa,That's excellent! It was one of the things making me hesitant to join the sub. I'll check it out now.
1112,Taveing,"You are absolutely correct, of course Fallon Fox is a he. Brain out for the weekend there."
1113,jupiter_sunstone,This  is insanity.
1114,Beaverdam11,Absolutely
1115,angrybroad,Why am I not surprised 🙄 men just have to conquer and control every damn thing even if it isn't for them.
1116,RogerStormzy,😍😍 Awesome I didn't know! Thanks!
1117,icequeenfrostine,the echo chamber is pure insanity. ppl who constantly use this term need to look at whats not directly being shoved down your throat and in ur face.
1118,icequeenfrostine,"yup that's the same thing as injecting literal infants with toxic inflammation-causing particles and human DNA 40x as much as two generations ago created by the same people that knowingly engineered an opioid crisis and ""regulated"" by the agency which holds the patents to these products. its called regulatory capture. its no conspiracy its plain and simple: profits over people. anyway im not debating anything. just stating simple facts. done now thx."
1119,icequeenfrostine,Grow up and do research. Logic will lead you better than emotions every single time I promise. And no I don’t “identify” as a gc feminist lmfao. These women are wondering what will happen when they die to their severely damaged children. Sub par state care....??? Think of these WOMEN and their TRUE stories. Conditional feminism is not feminism. I will always speak the truth without fear.
1120,BarbieDontWantYouHoe,"Thanks sister 😊
Enjoy the male-free space.❤️"
1121,QueenRowana,"No problem. They twist language so far even i make mistakes sometimes. I was in a discussion with a MtF recently about how Bruce Jenner is definitely a man regardless of this whole “i am cait” business. 

Basically i slipped up once and said she... you just hear the media say ‘she’ every time when talking about bruce and no matter how hard i try to remember he’s a dude sometimes i slip up and say she.  Its frustrating because the Tims immediately shout “ SEE! She is valid!!1!”  Which is BS. They just genderswitch so extremely you cant help but go along sometimes purely by accident. 

It just frustrates me..."
1122,evileine,"Gosh, did you know that vaccines prevent between 2 and 3 million deaths per year globally? What a horrible thing! Better get rid of them. Seriously, have you ever seen a baby with pertussis? Or measles? Have you ever had a chat with a polio survivor? You antivaxxers are a blight."
1123,,"Hahahaha you don't really understand ""facts"" when you make decisions that can harm your kid and other kids.  Of course you won't debate it, science doesn't support your stance."
1124,PassRestProd,"Yep - I wrote an article about how Shareholder Primacy in Corporate Law makes it impossible for Pharmaceutical Conglomerates to abide by the Hippocratic Oath, it was dismissed as a “Mommy Blog”... even though the only CEO of a major Pharmaceutical Company, Daniel Best, who began working for the Department of Health and Human Services died of an apparent suicide vis á vis multiple blunt force traumas when he decided to dedicate his life to changing the profit culture and making medicines, like insulin, more affordable. 

Not to mention when pediatrician Kenneth Stoller mentioned the 2004 Vaccine Summit on the DHHS government website and asked for a retraction of conflated numbers meant to scare people into getting more vaccinations than they needed (as was suggested at said summit, in the interest of Shareholder Primacy), the CDC didn’t contact the MSM sources that put out those scaremongering numbers and make sure people knew they were inaccurate. Now, there’s an article circulating where a Pharmaceutical CEO is quoted as saying Shareholders are their main concern, not the overall improvement of wellness of the people who inject/ take their products - their main concern is repeat business.

1125,twoXfeminist,"> Grow up and do research.

So I’m assuming by “research” that you mean to read the one 1998 paper that has been disproven and discredited for its bullshit numerous times, by dozens of medical professionals? Or do you mean the moms of children with autism, who’d rather have their children be dead than autistic?"
1126,icequeenfrostine,"say it with me: vaccine. safety. advocate. #safeandeffective
but sadly, inconvenient women are often called a blight so not unexpected.

also i said ten times i'm over responding. its just all the same over and over out of big pharma's blind supporters."
1127,icequeenfrostine,"to make it simple for you: this is basically the final frontier of ""believe women.""
what is happening to these women's children is not ""a conspiracy"" or a bunch of people ""faking it."" the reddit echo chamber exists even in subs like this one. keep going w that false narrative pushed by our privatized medical care system if u want. just pray it doesn't end up being ur kid and that's truly all i have to say on the matter."
1128,icequeenfrostine,"OMG someone with critical thinking skills !? Happy mf friday to me.
Vaccines are not tested for:
-interactions (the vaccine schedule has increased exponentially)
-carcinogenic potential
-fertility effects"
1129,icequeenfrostine,Definitely the moms and my point is the literal exact opposite of what you’re trying to pretend it is: their children are ALREADY dead or damaged . And who brought up AUTISM ???? Not me ! Kinda shows that subconsciously u can already realize that vaccines cause inflammation and inflammation can trigger autism in vulnerable individuals ! Kinda crazy how u just put the pieces tg for yourself without my help even lmfao .
1130,evileine,"You're done responding, and yet you respond. Women like you aren't merely inconvenient, you present a huge danger to people who are chronically ill or immune compromised. And as a retired medic, I've used the products made by big pharma to save hundreds of lives, so yes you could say I'm a big fan."
1131,,"Don't drag ""women"" into antivax nonsense."
1132,PassRestProd,...and all vaccines are taxed so they can pay off people who get vaccine injuries - the companies that make these products have no legal responsibility for the effects - they pass that financial burden onto the “consumer” (if you call mandatory injections consumption rather than manipulation of data for the purpose of securing government contracts - don’t get me started about the pertussis a vs pertussis b vaccine and how they lied about an outbreak caused by unvaccinated kids at Disneyland rather than a change in the vaccine itself).
1133,icequeenfrostine,one more time for people in the back.
1134,nautical_narcissist,"perfect format to use for this, thank you"
1135,HolunderHexe,"Purr purr. Thus pur(r)e purrmaid! It's really not asked to much to offer sex, when you don't want to! Women have done this for thousands of years, so just you get raped, too. At least he- ahm...the fragile little kitty is happy then."

1142,Upper_Canada_Pango,What is 'KERF'?
1143,lairacunda,"Hahaha.
In cabinetmaking *kerf* refers to the width of space left by the blade after it cuts through a piece of wood.  It's also the gap itself.

In this context however, I thought the *k* could stand for kink."
1144,Upper_Canada_Pango,Thank you.
