1,Hilarious that a TIM legit commented here trying to justify threats of rape and violence with ‚Äúsometimes us girls get angwy! UwU‚Äù

12,No better way to rationally and coherently argue your morally superior and logically sound philosophy than threatening violence upon those who disagree on the internet.

16,Doesn't saying something is a male behavior just as sexist as saying something is a female behavior? Just a thought

30,"No not really. Male socialization is completely different than how we women get socialized. 

It happens from birth when our sex is OBSERVED. 

**Female is the only class that gets killed upon being observed as female**.

""*You have done that yourself.*""

Unfortunate people in a NEET position, I definitely feel sorry for, but someone who goes to great lengths to inflict unemployment on others is another thing entirely.  The latter group don't have empathy for other people in the first place.  That's why apologizing to them only incenses their anger instead of assuaging it."

I‚Äôd also start with the written works of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and Andrea Dworkin. Please go read the sidebar at GC proper. There are evolutionary anthropologists and endocrinologists on Twitter for resources therein. Our debate sub is where you would go for greater nuance on these difficult matters (not here kiddo, I‚Äôm one of the mods here and we‚Äôre creating a space for women that doesn‚Äôt stifle them or tell them they‚Äôre too angry or not funny etc all the shite that men tell us hourly). 

Good luck!"

47,Thanks for the advice
48,"No worries. There‚Äôs also our r/detrans sub if you want lives from a completely different perspective TW there was a recent suicide alas alas. 

r/GCdebateTQ is the debate sub. r/gendercriticalcynical is another one if you want to see our lurkers in action. 

Seriously good luck, I hope you don‚Äôt do anything rashly but you‚Äôve also got to think of what‚Äôs best for you as you move forwards in this body anchored in space and time. We have some good ally transsexuals on Twitter is you want to see the the difference is attitudes between TWAW and TWAM. Fionne is one such ally. There was another one, Jenn but the got kicked off twitter cuz he accurately described himself as male. There are some trans subs that say you need dysphoria to be trans but I‚Äôm not sure which one would be best honestly. 

You gotta think for yourself after all. I hope you use some of these resources"

Meanwhile on GC posts we're all like.  Good, hopefully this will peak the normies so we can get our basic human rights back, I hope they don't murder her 'cause that would suck."
58,"I'm sure I read once that she uses initials rather than her name so as not to put boys off from reading her books. It's not uncommon among female authors either.

78,"I reported every single on that said ""TERF"" or used an image like that"
79,"> Girl, why can't you be quiet for once.

They use the term 'girl' to belittle her. A woman who is in her mid-50s and happens to be the most successful authors of our time is clearly not a 'girl' and they know it. That is why I refuse to call women anything but women."
80,"Ewww, wtf, why would they use Jotaro, he would just roll his eyes at them and say ''good grief!''. He doesn't have time or energy for anyones bullshit!"
81,Ironic considering how it's the TRAs coercing speech and denying facts

103,And their proposed surgeries\\sterilization of kids in the name of trans. Eugenics much?
104,What does this mean???
105,"True. She is filthy rich. But in this case i dont mind the fact that she gets all the attention. 
It‚Äôs sadly a basic fact of reality that the biggest moneybags get the most attention. 

In this case her wealth allows her to speak and feel relatively little of the backlash. 
While we shouldnt underestimate the voice of average people, having a wealthy ally works in our favor here. 

I‚Äôm secretly rooting to watch her battle it out with bruce jenner."
106,I would argue that because she is rich (and female) she will be more expected to bow down to trans orthodoxy.

139,"I said this before but basically:

I see the most noticeable difference between TiM and TiF being that:

Trans'men' want all transmen to be seen as men. They want to assimilate into maleness. Even though they can obviously never truly be male, they try their very best to be as true to a real man as they can manage.



Trans'women' want all women to be seen as transwomen. They are not interested in assimilating into femaleness but instead want femaleness to change to fit them. They don't even try to be as female as they could possibly be, instead they cosplay and make a mockery of femaleness. But somehow they are the true women, not us.

They want to push real women out of femaleness and take our place.


Yes, TiF's and TiM's are both wrong and mistaken, Yes, Neither of them can ever be what they want to be, Yes, both will still always be the sex they were born as. But of the two groups it is clear the TiM's are the more dangerous group."
140,"I‚Äôve been able to discuss my radfem views with nonbinary women and TIFs without problems.  The only time I‚Äôve ever had a discussion turn heated, it‚Äôs always with men/TIMs."
141,"Yep. I know a couple of trans men and they are really lovely people. The trans women I‚Äôve encountered, not so much."
142,"I noticed this back when I used Tumblr. The TiMs were quick with threats of rape and violence & profane slurs. But the TiFs would be like *""ummm, do you really feel that way about trans and non-binary people. That makes me sad. I feel uncomfortable reading your blog now :(""*

&#x200B;

Not surprisingly, the only time actual females resorted to threats & slurs is when they were playing shield-maiden for the TiMs (ie *""I'm a cis-woman!!! My best friend is a trans-woman and she's more of a REAL FEMALE than you and me put together!!! Go choke you TERF b!tch!!!!!""*). They never did it when defending ***themselves***; just in the defense TiMs and non-binary men. It's fucking sad that they don't see it"

146,It's TRUE!
147,it‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre not actual women
148,it‚Äôs actually entertaining seeing TiMs yell on twitter @ ‚Äúterfs‚Äù and then scrolling through their tweets and noticing how they always talk exactly like a stereotypical male. Obviously no one should be forced to conform to gender roles but men and women *do* tend to tweet differently and I think Ive only seen a TiM speak like actual woman do once on twitter.

I try not to be too judgey, I am not a small guy and I can look kind of sketch, especially in the dark."

but especially when I lived in Toronto this happened a fair bit and the women displayed unmistakable,  genuine fear. My running theory is that they're probably not paying enough attention initially and then realise ""oh shit there's a guy right behind me""

It still happens sometimes now that I live in redneck paradise but not as much, presumably since I don't look as *relatively* sketchy compared to the general population. Especially in this neighborhood."

Looks like we're back to only men being allowed to talk about our bodies. The pace at which we're losing things that we fought so hard to gain is increasing and the trans movement is what opened that door. Rather than deal with us as fellow human beings and members of society, they'll just replace us with ""women"" that think just like them but have wigs.

You can still be progressive and talk about how trans men‚Äôs vaginas affect them if you are so willing to cater to trans ideology out of fear, but TVM are specifically meant to talk about the physical experience of being a woman.

We shouldn't ignore facts because we learned about them first from the ""wrong people""."
336,"This feminist sub has read information from both sides of the debate, coalesced primary sources, and then debated and shared feelings about their own conclusions to these primary sources. Nothing about this approach to dialogue and information gathering is flawed. 

And as a more general note: Our political world is too binary as is imo, and unwillingness to come to educated conclusions based on all well-studied sides  only serves to radicalize those we disagree with and blocks dialogue. We cannot just rely on our own initial confirmation biases. One must engage with their perceived enemy and listen before drawing conclusions and adding our own voice if we want to get anywhere. This is a big issue I see in the trans community. They fail to respectfully listen to us when many of us used to believe in their ideology, and then came to different conclusions. Both left and right could stand to become a bit more tolerant of difference."
337,"'The \[Blank\] Monologues' according to the article.

I don't even have words for this. It's a massive slap in the face to the original Vagina Monologues, the intent of which was to destigmatize discussions about female genitalia. Now they're trying to erase the very word that the Vagina Monologues was designed to normalize, and using the name of the play to do it. It's absolutely sickening and shows they have absolutely zero understanding of feminism, or even basic decency.

Edit: Here's the school newspaper article about it. It's definitely real.

347,"I wonder if this is why western men are so desperate to get in to women's spaces, they are used to being spoilt and centred in that kind of environment. They want a harem. Even in normal classrooms teachers  use girls to keep control of the boys' behaviour and the girls' results suffer because of it. 

You don't seem to find that same invading behaviour in cultures where single sex schooling is still the norm."
348,"To be fair, everyone who auditions gets in the show every year. The audition is just a formality/a time for your to practice speaking in front of others/time for the directors to get to know your personality before you're formally assigned a role. 

My understanding was that the directors (who were students) *sought out* TIMs to include after the fact as a virtue signal."
349,"Hear, hear.

Some people have commented that female athletes should refuse to compete against trans athletes, they should walk away from the area where the competition is held.

I don't know how many athletes would agree to do that, though"
350,I wish I would have been more wise back then.
351,They feel sorry for them. Women infantalise men and patronise them. By assuming men are lesser or incapable women end up giving men even more power and resources and shore up the very system which oppresses them.
352,"I‚Äôm not saying we should trust these outlets as sources on their own, but if we hold some views in common, I don‚Äôt think that destroys any validity of the point if the root of our argument as GC feminists is sound. Of course, that does not mean we must agree with the vile beliefs of those we may agree with on other points. 

A confirmation bias is the tendency to be more lenient towards data that supports your cause or comes from a source to agree with. So no, you disagreeing with an easily disputed and illogical thought process would still be backed by sound data, I‚Äôm assuming. 

I do agree that we should share and debate primary sources from trusted and reputable sites on this subreddit (something that we‚Äôre honestly not that good at), as spreading untrustworthy rhetoric does convey acceptance of the whole. And i for one am tired of being any mamma
‚ÄúGood girl.‚Äù However, most of the debate on this thread was directly talking about the student newspapers that talked about these shows, not the right-wing response. Therefore I think this conversation is still worthwhile, even if the picture that prompted it is from a shitty source that personally I dislike too."
353,"Not exactly. Here's her statement: 

>So I was surprised to find that students at Mount Holyoke College have decided to retire The Vagina Monologues because they believe it is not inclusive to transgender students. Their statement reads, ‚ÄúAt its core, the show offers an extremely narrow perspective on what it means to be a woman ‚Ä¶ Gender is a wide and varied experience, one that cannot simply be reduced to biological or anatomical distinctions.‚Äù

>The Vagina Monologues never intended to be a play about what it means to be a woman. It is and always has been a play about what it means to have a vagina. In the play, I never defined a woman as a person with a vagina.

>Inclusion doesn‚Äôt come from refusing to acknowledge our distinctive experiences, and trying to erase them, in an attempt to pretend they do not exist. Inclusion comes from listening to our differences, and honoring the right of everyone to talk about their reality, free from oppression and bigotry and silencing. That‚Äôs real inclusion ‚Äî to listen to different stories, with curiosity, and love, and respect, in all their particular and distinctive human individuality.

I'm not sure how much of this is her trying desperately not to be thrown in the TERF bin, but even if none of it is, a lot of what she's saying goes against trans activism. And in any case it's very telling how TRAs interpreted ""Vagina"" as meaning ""women only"", almost like they know men don't have vaginas..."
354,"Did you notice any other TRA/libfem nonsense going on there that didn't make the news? People getting ""called out"" or ""cancelled"", women being censored, women's events and spaces being erased/invaded etc...?"

357,S - N - A - P!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
358,"People didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúcanceled,‚Äù no. I do think that the population was too intellectual to fall to the strict cancel culture we see online. The college itself doesn‚Äôt have a woman‚Äôs center, Which to me is ludicrous. Women‚Äôs rights were really only mentioned insofar as the higher rates of rape and sexual assault faced by women. There was, in the same year, a high influx of women sharing their sexual assault stories and trying to get the university to pay attention. But there was a real lack of good and easily disseminated information on topics like women in STEM, being a woman in the workforce, ect...  

I‚Äôm not sure if there were ever any TIMs invading woman‚Äôs spaces (somewhat due to the lack of struck woman‚Äôs spaces). The sororities usually has higher up rules (at the national or international) level barring men from participating. (The university itself had incredibly sexist policies surrounding Greek life, but I feel like this is a convo for another time haha)"

1. Being uncomfortable with my body: breasts, hips, etc

2. Being uncomfortable with the femininity that is forced upon women and not identifying with it whatsoever

3. Being uncomfortable with society's expectation of and treatment towards women. No, women everywhere are not looking to be baby makers, no women everywhere do not like getting hit on/harassed by random guys, no women everywhere do not like being submissive, in sex or life in general, women are not universally, inherently gentle, peace loving, feminine, kind, passive or any of the other traits ascribed onto women. Women are not all naturally flirty, girly and don't all love makeup - many don't care for it. No, women everywhere don't care exponentially more about their appearance than men do. Just because some women do these behaviors does not mean all women do, even if it makes us feel less individually ""empowering"".


Further, we must examine why so many women are entrapped in this stuff anyways. What are our cultural motivations for behaving the way we behave? And no, it is not condescending to question these things (in fact we should be questioning all sorts of decisions from all sorts of people, not just women)

Being uncomfortable with the subliminal messaging that relates society to women and vice versa is a phenomenon universal to women, I'd say. It doesn't mean you're broken and not a woman. And trying to go non binary isn't going to liberate you from that. I want more women to be aware of this."

411,So many kids in their young teens think 'transition' is a way to escape the 'unpleasant changes' their body undergoes when maturing.
412,When they become an adult they can decide which hormones they want
413,Great. Can't wait for the number of trans children to skyrocket once gen y and gen z start having children.
414,"I mean, gen y are now all between the ages of 20 and 40, so have been having children for some time now"
415,Well ok. Once *more* of them start having children and those kids begin to explore their identity.
416,"Got beaten by his own logic while he was trying to call other people stupid.

Also, why do TRAs always have to bring race into this shit as if what trans people face is anything remotely like what minority races have faced in the past? It feels super racist to use the past struggles of non-white people in the US for political points."

Did someone bribe her to make trans people look as bad as possible? Did she think it would be hilarious to start trolling people IRL?"
453,You guys do realize trans men exist right?

526,"We don‚Äôt hate you guys, stop being so ridiculous, unless you‚Äôre one of the many many of trans‚Äùwomen‚Äù who rape and murder us. One of your guys raped an infant but got released cuz poor widdle baby raping transie. 

Why don‚Äôt you get some empathy for what real women face. We can‚Äôt opt out of our oppression whilst you men try to opt in."

528,"So I really thought for a minute it was someone I got into a Facebook ‚Äúargument‚Äù with about this exact subject. This profile pic and his are virtually identical. 
The Facebook argument? He used the  phrases, ‚ÄúPeople who menstruate,‚Äù and ‚ÄúPeople with uteruses.‚Äù And I said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot simpler way to say that- women.‚Äù

>Stop saying what I genuinely believe in case some people don't like it? Nah. Thanks for the suggestion though. Isn't free speech amazing?

544,"while i obviously love seeing men being good allies, i wonder why there wasn‚Äôt this massive outcry about ricky gervais being a huge twansphobe in the way that there was about jk rowling. 
is it maybe because he‚Äôs a man and men aren‚Äôt expected to pander to tras in the same way that women are?"

561,"Also is it just me or is the practice of asking people's pronouns making transness the standard? A decade ago nobody would ever feel the need to ask a masculine looking woman what her pronouns are, you'd just assume she's butch  or a tomboy. Sure you had people being cheeky like ''oh do you want to be a man?'', but the first assumption was just masculine woman."

I feel like for a long period of time as people started to come out more comfortably and gay marriage becoming legal across states slowly that I was less and less migendered as male. It seemed more people got the whole, ""oh yeah!! butch women!"" thing. Then the Trans movement blew up just after gay marriage swept across the US federally and all the sudden I'm looked at like I'm about to come out as a Trans man. Like, no, bitch. I'm still just a big ol butch lesbian. And don't get me wrong for a moment I questioned things because all of this shit surrounded me and made me feel like I almost HAD TO BE Trans. But, alas, I'm a stubborn butch. üòò"
568,"Yep, having your womanhood questioned for not being stereotypical enough is apparently progress? Interesting that the female category is narrowing based on what men want it to mean. Women better just listen, accept, and support. for progress."
569,"In german there's a nice phrase for this: ""Getroffene Hunde bellen"" (""struck dogs bark"") which means that when you know someone else is right about something you don't like, you're more likely to be upset about it and to feel the need to defend yourself."
570,How can individuals know they are a woman anymore if they were raised during the gender hysteria? I think you take your security in knowing you are a woman a bit for granted. Since the whole gender ideology thing is being shoved down children's and teens throats and TIM's claim to be better women than actual females.
571,"Oh, sorry, context. Worked in retail for a long time. So when someone said, ""excuse me, sir."""
572,"Stubborn, self assured women are the best."
573,"I am convinced that if I was born a couple of years later, I would have been forced into transitioning. This whole debacle still affected me; for a while I felt like less of a woman, because I didn't perform femininity or don't have a porn star body. Also the whole 'autists have masculine brains' thing didn't help."
574,Germans truly always have the word or phrase for everything
575,"Oh shit, that's actually a scary good point. We may have generations coming up that DON'T know what their own sex is. Assuming this isn't dealt some serious damage in the 2020/2024 Olympics, which I pray to my evil feminist goddess for."

Thing is, seems like the people who are most in support of this actually don't know any trans people, have no experience with any of this, don't understand the side effects, they're just voicing their support for likes on social media. 

Just because a kid plays with a stereotypical girl or boys toy does not mean they need to undergo surgery or take hormones."
588,"One time on a forum someone asked everyone how they feel about kids playing with the ""opposite genders'"" toys. Some people replied saying that it was 'transphobic to not let them'.

There is a national period day because misogyny, female erasure and the usual disgust at female biology led to a taboo surrounding periods that cause women to suffer all around the world. A lot of women still don't have access to basic hygiene and period products, which can lead to medical, but also social issues. A lot of girls and women and missing out on education because they can't go to school while on their period, because of a lack of access to period products. A lot of women and girls are also suffering abuse while on their periods, because of misogyny and general disgust at female biology (look up menstruation huts). For all of these reasons it is important to speak up about periods, because women shouldn't have to suffer of this basic biological fact just because men would rather they shut up about it."

I personally am not likely to date a bi woman but it‚Äôs more of a personal preference because for me, my complete lack of attraction to men feels just as important to my relationship to my sexuality and how it affects my life as my attraction to women is and I really like having a partner who fully relates, so for myself I choose to only date other lesbians who feel the same way. But I also know not all lesbians have (nor should they need to have) the same priorities as me in that regard, and I would certainly never advise another lesbian against dating a bi woman she was genuinely interested in, I would only be excited and hopeful for her. Not a single one of my bi friends would ever dream of cheating on a partner, male or female, and several of them even sway heavily toward dating other women. It‚Äôs definitely very real for them and the stereotypes are so harmful to bi people who are just looking for genuine connection like anyone else"

840,"That's the Gaslighting and brainwashing from Tumblr and  ""Trans Support Groups."" They have been repeatedly told that they are men and Male. They will automatically have male privilege when they pass. They need to ""Support and signal boost Trans women who gave that up [ since when, they are just growing boob]. The most brainwashed will do as there told."
841,"Of course, because the TRA Movement doesn‚Äôt give a shit about trans men lol. The only times I‚Äôve ever seen them be mentioned was in passing accusations of misogyny (yes, I‚Äôm serious- I‚Äôve seen many transwomen accuse trans men of having male privilege and being misogynistic towards them....the fucking irony)."
842,Lmao
843,"It's even worse in private chats, I've seen transmen delete their messages seconds after they send it because they dont want to share an opinion, and transwomen tell me they'll slit my throat for telling them that shaving their legs dosnt make them women."
844,"I've seen that, too. The trans man was forced to ""self-crit"" over their ""male privilege."" The most tragic part was she didn't look remotely male. She looked like a butch lesbian (which is what she was)."
845,"Men really are just the worst huh. Doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre wearing pants or a catgirl skirt, it‚Äôs all the same."
846,"To be honest, I am a bit afraid of transwomen because they constantly threaten lesbians with rape for not wanting the ""girldick.""

Not transphobia though, since it's not an irrational fear."
847,"I wasn't expecting this level of intelligence from an anime avatar! Usually, if the have an anime avatar, they're the worst..."
848,"They should stop lurking because we will always see them as what they are : adult human males. 

They know they are lying and pretending, and others can see that too. I would suggest them to go after men's subs, who aren't afraid to be very blunt about not dating ""transwomen""."
849,"Thanks for redacting the name and reposting it!

859,"We get attacked from both the misogynistic and the homophobic parts of the trans rights movement. We're silenced, insulted, threatened, abused. Our own allies in the LGBT community have turned against us.

We're an oppressed group that is a subgroup of another oppressed group, but for some fucking reason it has become fashionable to hate us. Bigotry against lesbians to the point of calling for us to be killed is acceptable now. Just label us ""TERFs"" for not wanting to suck a dick and they can heap abuse on us all day, everyday.

It's so incredibly frustrating."
860,She is saying fuck off to the misogynistic lurkers and brigaders here. Sprain yourself reaching there huh.
861,"Same - I LOVE Pokemon so much, and they‚Äôve appropriated Sylveon as a ‚Äútrans icon‚Äù because of Sylveons colour scheme. The irony being lost on them as Eevees male/female rate is 87.5% male, 12.5% female, which stays the same when evolved into any eeveelution, so Sylveon is 87.5% male.

Like why not pick a sexless Pokemon? You could literally pick Ditto, as Ditto could transition into any Pokemon, why not pick a Pokemon who can literally transition?

So many Pokemon groups I‚Äôve been part of have had a lot of sexist, homophobic, MRA trans folk, and it‚Äôs so frustrating to see as incels and transcels really are ruining the weeb community."
862,"Yep, since the surge of anime watchers in the mid-2010s, the quality of animes turned to massive shit. Full of perverted, male protagonists with massive hero complex that kids love to watch and learn from, boobs, BOOBS EVERYWHERE, pedophilic, casual rape and sexual assault imagery, and so much more mind-numbing shit. I remember the days when weebs have actual meaning to them and otaku is the term for people who like anime. So you can't really blame people when they automatically assume they're a failure to society."
863,"Same. But tbh a lot of anime is crap. But that's true for any medium. When someone says ""I hate anime"" I'm always thinking ""that's like hating music or movies in general"". It's just a medium, not a genre."
864,"Shinoa was too good of character for that anime, honestly. That plot was so out there. I think everyone watched for her smug charming personality. Everything else was so forgettable."

867,"I'm straight and I don't want to suck a dick, I wonder what they'd think of me! (lol, they'd probably say I'm a trans man in denial!)"
868,the Pokemon community  has been shit for awhile do to  mass amount of man babies.
869,"Well the cute girls doing soft lesbian things and fan service bullshit sells.  Boy do they sell....and they're expensive too.  The cute fetish bullshit  box sets usually go for 100-200 dollars. Just check the right stuff anime. The most popular stuff is the garbage and its really expensive. 

Meanwhile I only spent twenty bucks on the new Mob 100 season 2 box set.   Go figure. Dororo is the most expansive box set I am looking forward to right now if it ever gets released in west.  The wait is real."
870,ONS just has a special place in my heart and i love the whole squad but yeah the plot is so off the rails I haven't even bothered reading the manga because it's so crazy. Demon Slayer has a better plot and Shinobu Kochou resembles Shinoa both personality and looks wise. They even have the same Japanese voice actress so! If you haven't seen it I recommend that

899,Why won't anyone tell me who to be?! I have no idea what to buy or who to be to affirm my identity if it's not marketed and catering especially to me!
900,">it's exhausting

Well I can agree with that."
901,"Nearly every aspect of her nonbinary identity is apparently a good or service she will need to purchase. And she needs to do purchase them so everyone around her will know who she is. Why is it so important that everything about her be communicated to the outside world - or possibly even, by reflection, to herself - in a single, hyperaccurate visual snapshot? A single image that contains, holographically, every aspect of her being? 

Is this even possible? Let alone desirable? Why would I even want strangers passing in other cars to know my exact internal mix of ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" traits? Why would I want my shoes or haircut or musical taste to communicate deeply personal things about me to people I don't even know? 

I dunno, this seems like a bad timeline."

Idk... I'm super feminine now but in college and childhood I was super poor and dressed ""neutral"". This person needs ""their"" privilege checked bc it's pretty easy to put together a nonbinary outfit at the thrift store."
913,"Just gonna say that men‚Äôs deodorant works so much better than women‚Äôs. Back in college I thought my roomie was weird for using it but now it‚Äôs the only thing I use.

Women‚Äôs: smell by the end of the day

914,"I buy cologne marketed to men often. I don‚Äôt smell like a man, I just smell good."
915,I just don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt make up their minds about if things can be gender specific or not. Things suddenly only have a gender when they want to complain about them smh

925,"Yeah I was thinking that while fragrances being marketed as ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" is dumb altogether, there are TONS of fragrances out there that aren't marketed as such anyway. And cars generally aren't marketed towards men or women, and most adult women who wear backpacks don't wear Barbie backpacks. This person is creating issues for themselves that don't even exist."
926,"The ""nonbinary"" perfume/cologne really made me laugh, because there are plenty marketed as just that! Am I showing my age by remembering how popular CK1 was in the 90s?"

930,"What she doesn't understand is that almost nobody on the planet cares enough about her to take even an atom of interest in any of this. We should all realize and accept that, it is very liberating"
931,"I think humans have always been obsessed with how others perceive us - we're social creatures.

But I know exactly what you mean by the 'snapshot' thing and I think it's defo an internet culture influence. Instagram outfit of the day posts, Pinterest mood boards and Tumblr inspiration blogs have really given a rise to this idea that we can curate not just the image that we portray of ourselves to others online, but that we can curate our entire existence. If you could control how others perceive you at any given moment, would you? I think some people believe that it matters more than you or me do - maybe because (as other people have pointed out) they genuinely don't have bigger problems in life than combatting their own individualism.

It's easy to forget that none of that shit is real. No one can be a walking TOMBOY SPRING FASHION moodboard."
932,"It's some demented neoliberal hyper-capitalist dystopian bullshit.  These brats need to unplug and ""drop out"" from the 24/7 media brainwashing."
933,"I would, if she wasn't so annoying"
934,"It does help them to point out that these are non-issues. No sane adult is stressing over ""does my room look like it belongs to a boy??"""
935,"Well this person is old enough to have a car. And we are showing how ""non binary"" just reinforces oppressive gender roles. OP is reinforcing gender roles by worrying about whether or not her car or backpack are ""too girly"" or ""too masculine."" And it also shows how much of trans ""problems"" come from a place of being privileged and not having other things to worry about. 

Worrying about whether or not your music taste is ""too girly"" is internalized misogyny imo. Of course we shouldn't blame girls who have internalized misogyny."
936,"Showing people how ridiculous they are and poking their egos is a great way of helping them.

942,"In the goth scene, literally all shoes are gender neutral."
943,"Alright, granddad"
944,"I'm really into perfumery. Every second of every day on fragrantica and other sites, all these made up boundaries about scent. People asking questions all day. ""Could a man pull this off???"" Sitting there typing up these questions asking strangers if they're fucking allowed to smell a certain way. And when it comes to age, they go insane. ""This is only for young girls"". ""This is only for business women over 35"". These are all real things people say. How about if someone's grandma wants to wear Pink Sugar, SHE CAN AND IT DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL."

949,Worst perfume ever. I genuinely despise it
950,"None of that person's sentence even made sense. The implication that the only gender neutral shoes are ""something a grandparent would wear"". What does that even mean? What kind of shoe is that?
Does this person see a pair of basic black doc Martens and then sit there and ponder what gender they are? Well...they probably do since even the light scent of a shampoo is such a big problem."

It‚Äôs stupid."
956,"Side note: I love Pink Sugar! I'm going to wear it when I'm old and god willing I'll still dye my hair purple.

This is 2020 and we don't age shame women. Jlo is still a Goddess at 50. And the lady with pink hair at my town's nursing home is the favorite.

It is bc she is happy. She isn't bitter that she ""has to comform"" to a beauty standard for older women. She continues to do what she wants even within a nursing home. Men want women past a certain age to become invisible. Fuck that."
957,The person in the screen cap is nonbinary.

962,"Everyone is nonbinary, it is meaningless"
963,[deleted]
964,"The scent of shampoos and conditioners can never stay in your hair for long. That just makes the ""concern"" funnier. I don't know why they're imagining that if their shampoo is strawberry scented, they're suddenly radiating the smell of strawberries like a freaking yankee candle.

Anyway, I spray perfume on a comb and comb my hair when I want my hair to smell great!"
965,Not to this person. They need nonbinary everything.
966,"Ah, that's clear now that I reread the post.

Its frustrating. TRAs say they speak for GNC people, but their gender roles are restrictive too."
967,"I do think the smell stays for a bit, depending on what kind of hair you have but someone probably would have to put their face right into your hair.  There's things to put in your hair when it's dry and those can sometimes smell good too, but again, someone would probably have to come quite close.
Maybe a Yankee candle in the pocket is the way to go!!"
968,The only thing she needs is therapy. Her whole life is actually meaningless.

Common sense wins out. Seven year olds can‚Äôt make that decision and honestly, the right wing folks made a convincing argument for how this opens the door to pedophilia (aka if ila kid is old enough to decide his gender he can decide to  have sex too.)"

975,Love it. haha
976,What‚Äôs the Texas kid situation?
977,[removed]
978,"And it's essentially forced sterilization. This entire movement is utterly disgusting.

I hate to be the one to make the prediction but desperate men do violent things. Personally if it were my kid, I would have absconded to Nigeria with both of my kids by now. Maybe he wanted to give logic and the justice system a chance first. But I hope he's working on an exit strategy now.

If there's anything worth fighting and dying for, it's the health and safety of your children."
979,Yeah the conspiracy theorist in me feels this is all apart of one big push to make pedophilia legal.
980,"This is good for pedos but not in the way you think.

Pedophile AGP TIMs are grooming young boys to become trans, to hate and resent their concerned parents and then convincing them to run away at an age where they cannot work to support themselves. 

These boys are groomed into satisfying the pedo's fetishes and to being the kind of trans girl they never could (because of puberty and age).

There are pedos out there collecting boys like this, offering a place to stay, with the expectation of sex.

I only know about this because a teen mtf told me his story and I asked around and realized it was not an isolated incident.

And besides these cases, there are plenty of old men encouraging much younger men and boys to transition into hypersexual imitations of girls and young women. That behavior is easily found in the trans social media. It is normalized pedophilia."
981,"I'm right-wing (not a Trump fan really though) and I'm a part of all these ""TERF"" subs lol. It's great finding common ground and this is such an important topic right now"
982,"The case with the 7 year old has popped up a lot in traditionalist religious circles too. I've noticed it a lot in conservative spaces also. Obviously, they're against it and sometimes for the same reasons as feminists. While it's good that there's a large opposition, It's also sad because now the TRAs are just going to lump us all in together and say that feminists support right-wing and oppressive religious ideologies."
983,"You've seen the headline probably.. ""Texas court rules against father of 7 year old son who's mother wanted son to become transgendered."" 
Something like that"
984,"Yes that's it!forced sterilization. Disgusting. They want to stop 'overpopulation.' Disgusting. The media, the movement, all of it. Taking so much away from so many people."
985,"Or just a conspiracy to push transition by the very few companies that make hormones.  
Each mtf is a client for life for them, as it's dangerous to stop taking hormones after castration.  
Not sure if ftm can stop taking hormones, but I guess them, too, are clients for life."
986,Perfect examples
987,"So...how many of them? A few, half, most, all? Not even a gynecologist can tell?"

1006,"on tumblr it's common for trans rights activists/genderists to reblog something a radfem wrote about misogyny/lesbophobia/homophobia/sexism/patriarchy/male violence and then freak out or be coerced into retracting said post, once they realize that a radfem wrote the post, and that they agree with (whatever aspect of) radical feminist analysis"
1007,"Aside from what vistarmonei mentioned, there's also a thing on tumblr where libfems will copy-paste radfem posts (instead of reblogging, which would give credit to the OP), sometimes with the caveat ""stolen because OP was a TERF"". They literally take radfem posts word-for-word for their own use while insisting we're as bad as Nazis and should be beaten to death. They like the things that radfems say so much that they feel the need to share them with others. Always makes me wonder if they're gonna peak soon."
1008,Dogs have nothing to do with nazi ideology. Radfem posts talk about radfem ideology.
1009,No. A map is a graph of a physical location. Don't let them use that word.

1048,"Thanks for the galaxy brain, beardo!

Presumably this means bleeders can become non-bleeders by simply announcing ourselves as such? Because this bitch is about to self-ID allllllll the way out of her menstrual cycle."

1054,"Being a ""bleeder"" is why I'm an actual woman, ya dolt. So if that's the new word for me, I'll happily be a ""bleeder"" - trans women can GTFO of my term.

1080,"Wokeness rules for women, free expression for TIMs

See, because it's not ""real feminism"" if you aren't spending all your time scrutinizing women for ""transphobia"" instead of doing *anything* else, like keeping abortion and birth control available in red states.  And it's doubleplus crimethink if you want lesbian bars to thrive instead of dying off just so men can have validation.

1091,"This times 1000000000.

&#x200B;

This is the classic sexual imbalance that we are all suffering through right now.  Male sexuality is the only one considered - and that's before we get into all the violent and degrading stuff.

Healthy sex is sex where male sexuality and female sexuality is balanced EQUALLY. Both give, and both receive pleasure.  There is no sense of ""taking"", ""using"", or a one-sided exchange in any way.  And this goes also for same-sex couples - the partners need to be balanced.  Imbalance = unhealthy.

&#x200B;

I can't believe how common it is now for people to equate aggression with passion.  Porn has done the terrible trick of convincing young men that all young women secretly fantasize about being slightly scared in bed, or that they secretly want this."

1093,I personally think a lot of these people just don't know how to have good sex NORMALLY therefore they venture into the weird and depraved shit. Just a hypothesis
1094,If you can't have satisfying vanilla sex it means you suck at sex
1095,"You mean you don't like being gagged to the point of vomiting and don't want a dude choking you out just so he can jizz? Um wow okay prude. Sorry bout your big oof, yikes"
1096,Libfems are attempting to naturalize these unsafe sexual practices so they don't have to think about the reality they are being manipulated by these pornsick men.
1097,"Kinky sex is formulaic and heavily depends on consumerism.

If you think a satisfying sex life depends on having a trunk of plastic/ metal shit under your bed, with 5-10 ultra stereotypical decades old scenaris to reenact ad nauseam; congrats you also have the sexual imagination of a boiled squid.

And I say this as a ""domme leaning"" heterosexual woman."

1099,"Seriously. Having sex without thinking of the male gaze, without performing, and using as your guide what makes you and your partner hot? That's the most fun type of sex there is! It's about exploring, seeing what makes that person tick, seeing what gets a positive reaction, and seeing what makes you both enjoy the moment."

1101,Some of the most disgusting stuff has a lot of views. It‚Äôs so damaging to young men‚Äôs psyche. The stuff I read on the r/GenderCritical is heartbreaking
1102,"Yes, that false equivalence of aggression and passion is exactly the problem!

Meanwhile, some of us are so starved for real passion that we settle for aggression instead. It‚Äôs not okay. It‚Äôs not enough."
1103,"> I can't believe how common it is now for people to equate aggression with passion

you're right, my SO was super(and still is) super careful whenever where in bed

1105,"I really don't know what makes someone a domme or a sub, like me and my SO mainly stick to missionary(my favorite position) and cowgirl  and oral(for me he personally doesn't like reviving oral)

1107,"I wonder if it is because with toxic masculinity, men are taught to turn every emotion that makes them feel weak into anger"
1108,Their not fooling anybody.
1109,"The concept of Dom and sub is so insanely outdated. Power should not have a place in sex. If I want to give my partner head, I shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it being a ‚Äúpower play‚Äù or having it being viewed as a ‚Äúsubmissive‚Äù act. I wish libfems would let people enjoy regularly ol‚Äô sex without assigning weird kinks to it!!!"
1110,"I feel it's ""bullshit"" like 'masculinity and feminity', but  they do all affect everyone's lives deeply.

Imo being a ""dom""  het woman can mean as little as refusing ""penis in orifices"" to be central to your sexuality. Or ""man on top active, woman passive"". Or ""dick in orifice=central act, clit=foreplay"".

There are so few men accepting to not base sex on ""ramming their dicks in our holes"", I cannot pretend that imposing sex be done in a way which is physiologically pleasurable for women \[ without any of the nefarious effects like pregnancy or stds\] has ""nothing to do with subverting sexual roles"".

TL""DR: If you impose sex shit that most men don't dig, you gon be called a ""domme"".

Whatever, I accepted terf already, I might as well own ""domme"" too. Yaaay prostate."
1111,"Holy shit, you just nailed why I fit in the ""Domme"" category when I bought into that shit!!  (Not actually heterosexual, but when I had het sex, this is how I was).
