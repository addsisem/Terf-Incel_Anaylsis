1,TheSoftParade69,Holy fuck BASED BASED BASED BASED. I need to organize a cel meetup.
2,KuroRX,doesn’t look anywhere NEAR as bad as that inceltears meetup
3,deadmanwalking124,"Lifefuel. Should organize a convention next. Hire security, blackpill presentation, debates, the works."
4,Rakkuuuu,"Look at all that evil oozing from them, my personality detector is overloading. 

In all seriousness, these guys look so fucking kind and wholesome. IT won't touch this because it defeats their bullshit narrative that people can sense their terrible personalities from a mile away. I wish I was there with my bros."
5,qanon1029,"YES!! It happened!!!

u/braziliansigma, is this what a white supremacist group looks like? Are these the demographics you guys expected?"
6,dirtwiz,me in the camo

12,Rateme4258,Was this a legit incel Meetup?
13,cmody112,How evil and vile these people are
14,ShahOfShinebox,"What the fuck?

People actually showed up for this? Every single one of those people deserve lowinhib cred"
15,FedCel,Damn the trap worked
16,realArthurFleck,"None of them are really ugly or have bad skin, they're all just ethnic or short. JUST"

19,you_are_on_steroids,Asian guy standing on the right looks good though. Kpopmaxxed
20,BlackPillSavedMe2,MY BUDDY BOYOS
21,GoffSystemQB,"Anybody saying anybody there is a fakecel is gatekeeping/coping.  Most of these guys are low-tier normies.  Some good looking Asian guys, but we know being Asian is a huge hit to their SMV.  The couple of above-average looking white guys probably have autism.

That's it they are all incels."
22,ice-slice,"They're all on the list now, great job."
23,loropianastormsystem,Based if true
24,halimawcel,"Oddly enough, I find this as lifefuel. Behind the comments and death wishes from IT, these are actual people behind the screen.

It's easy to dehumanize incels, IT. But realizing that these are also human beings changes your perspective."
25,mukerflap,dam they are all fat white neckbeard nazis IT was right
26,mylifeisropefuel,"you guys look so friendly

FUK I need an incel squad of frens to LDAR and copemaxx with."
27,trouble_with_logic,This'll go down as one of the defining moments of this sub
28,stupidredditcucks,"All you guys saying ""it's not over, they can ascend"" are just coping hard. Sub 8 law is legit, Chad or death in 2020."
29,Mao_did_nothing_wong,"Am I the only one that feels like he is witnessing something truly beautiful?

Gonna post this to IT holy fuck all of their fucking strawmans obliterated in one picture."

44,,"Not sure if this is a real incel meetup, or a /s"
45,fuckrule9,Wait it actually happened? It wasnt an FBI trick???
46,Username_1_3_4,"The reason why IT won't post this, is because it will negeat their whole narrative.

Posting that to IT would make people think and we can't have that."
47,Reynoodlepoodle,stop showering so much plz youre making inceltears look bad
48,Yonko-kaido,"Some massive copers in the comments section. Most of these guys except for the blond green shirt are a 4 or below. Def incel tier, and that’s only for their face. Also taking their height into account, it’s over for almost all of them. Unless they want a landwhale."
49,hopfield,"This is how bad women have gotten, that completely average looking men are destined to be social outcasts and virgins"
50,TheOnePucnhMan,"Damn, a lot of these guys aren't half bad, like the dude around the middle doing the ok/white power sign isn't even ugly (no clue about height tho of course)"
51,Kormaken,Wholesomepilled.

53,KEKPOP,Tis the best picture ive seen in a while
54,TouchedOnlyByMom,If this were done in OC id be all in
55,FluidRelief3,Is there any proof that this is a actual incel meetup and not some random pic?
56,braincelsrefugee,People sorting by new. Share! Share! Share! Op fucking based to do this. I nominate you to handle PR from henceforth
57,throwawayjustbewhite,hang on I thought incels were all white supremacist nazis?!
58,nothingmatters9,Everyone in this photo looks 19.

64,JihadiShandi,Need a Britcel meet up ngl
65,inceltiers2,Based and cute-pilled hope they made friends for life <3
66,nierviewii,Keep in mind that only somewhat decent looking and NT guys showed up. Trucels would never come to these meetups.
67,heswet,You absolute madmen.
68,mrmarfanman,"They all look so nice. I want to be there with them talking about the intricacies of dual-mating strategies and hypergamy, but they’d probably be like, “bro, chill, we talk about that on the Internet enough. Let’s just relax and play Smash together”."
69,eneak21,Not one nigga was there lmao
70,neighboursloli,This pic is pretty wholesome with enough ethnics I’m not gonna call out the two nonshort jbw guys.
71,you_are_on_steroids,I would hang out with you
72,bcomax1000,Now it's only a matter of time before incels community becomes mainstream and end up subverted by roasties and Chads.
73,,Wish I could have been there too
74,DarthSpectra,Wait... Is this for real?!
75,TypesWithEmojis,"Incelcon 2020?

Who's the madlad thats gonna host it"
76,Indoscel,Mogs me so hard fuckk
77,Garbo_Man,ngl i dont see the ugly faces some of you guys say about yourselves. but maybe its because i couldnt see the height.

81,HoustonOilers1998,"thats cool, I wish we had an incel meetup wihin 1000 miles of me as opposed to in Cali"
82,rechidna,All of these people have a better hairline than me. The blond guy and the guy in the bode hoodie are way too good looking.
83,ComradeCarter,"You guys got room in your ranks for a not-short, alright-looking guy that thinks there’s a lot of societal basis in incel ideas when it comes to sexual/erotic capital?

You seem like a nice bunch of boys."
84,IncelOfColor,You guys are awesome! I love you all.
85,Rkorgo,This was real?
86,,Ok but the white one with the cardigan and glasses and curly hair is so cute all these dudes mog the shiitt out of me
87,Tony_Danza_the_boss,This is a awesome. But Chadlite blonde in the middle you’re a fakecel bro
88,,Like none of those guys even look short. Several of them are over six feet tall. Most look average to tall. These fuckers are not even short.
89,preonsoup,"groups will be formed

90,operationteakwoods,You will not have a chance regardless of face below 6’

93,JedYorks,All Younger and better looking than me. Over
94,lolwut4reelz,"Congrats, your all infinity more fuckable then the mutants at IT. Now be less autistic and I'm sure some retarded girl would fuck you."
95,stupidredditcucks,This isnt even a genuine incel meetup btw. Its just some college club that decided to troll for fun.
96,Neetops,I'd say about 3 people are volcels in this group
97,retardedsubhuman,lmao literally every one of them mogs me. at least half of these are volcel. tired of posting with fucking larpers
98,Salamander7645,Wow look at all those people that don’t shower and don’t groom themselves and don’t b themselves.

Some of them look incel, but some of the white guys look fine wtf"
106,armanikek,"it's absolutely over for us if these guys are considered incels nowadays jfl, literally none of them are fat or look greasy and unwashed they're all normal looking dudes, loling @ women's standards in the current year"
107,Alexis_Lord,I find 6/16 attractive just based on looks alone.
108,Crim0951,Fake. Too many tallfags to be a real image

111,Brandon_37,Guy in the green idk if you see this but you could totally ascend with lifts and statusmaxxing unless autistic or a dicklet or something
112,taeryne,I'd totally bang at least 6 of them.
113,npc15000,Damn no shortcels they look decent they need to fashionmaxx and I would go but I'm not taking any fucking pictures
114,breakingthroughthis,Fakecel meet up
115,Pastelitomaracucho,"You guys look great. In all honesty, you just look young. 

Keep improving yourselves and don't get too bitter, you will be slaying in a few years.

Yeah, the typical reddit meetup is landwhales and weebs. If they can get laid, you can do X10"
116,ArmondDillo,How about not doxing yourselves?
117,FluidRelief3,"It was probably not a incel meetup

https://m.facebook.com/ucscrepublicans/?__tn__=C-R

Many of these guys are on photos of republican club. This club probably had meeting there and some lefties did this poster as a joke."
118,Blobs94,Why are all the asian guys here hot? Is it their outlook on life that’s shot? What a shame dawg
119,antibullydude,"For basically everyone here, it must be their confidence holding them back. They all pretty much look good and look like nice guys."
120,Personal-Judgment,You all look so heckin valid!
121,markokmarcsa,"Wait,they seem kinda normal?"
122,HeartofDestiny,"Of course, some of the white guys are fakecel. The blone and the guy with the bandana need to fuck off they are both good looking enough to get a girlfriend."
123,GhaznaviRambo,All of these guys are volcel lmao. Especially that blonde with the retarded ok sign. Tell him to wear slacks and he'll run into some girl who thinks he's rich. YOU FAGGOTS ARE ALL VOLCELS.
124,DSJ1995,Some fags in the picture could easily ascend
125,KittensAblaze,"They all have a lovely smile and look so friendly!!
I can’t believe any of them are incels. 
This is really wholesome :,)

I want to be friends with them all, you can tell they have a great sense of humour."

135,spicyspecimen,ok but the dude in the jean jacket on the far right is hella cute and he has a nice fashion sense
136,YourMomsSpaget,"Ngl, some of these guys are cute, but I’m a guy so they may call me a faggot. Depending if they call themselves “black pilled”. Hope they find love"
137,SauceBeUponHim,Groups me
138,SoBreezy74,I do hope these guys made some real friends after this meeting. Some are pretty cute like the Asian dude in the denim jacket.
139,thegodsoul,Can you imagine being the shortest guy at a short guy meet-up? Damn.
140,skaruhastryk,You should have a pack of matches for ratio. I'm not convinced your not NBA players.
141,Cigarello123,What a sausage fest
142,librepensador93,I Love you bros
143,piter57,Guys you are looking good here!! Happy for you
144,Flux_Nova07,"They're all really cute seriously, I find it hard to believe they would have trouble with women."
145,Nyeaheh123,Fucking losers
146,lahanis,"So lets see If I got this right. I see a bunch of normal looking guys, would probably bang many If personality isnt complete trash. And I know others  would too. So i dont see a problem there. But you guys, instead of couraging your fellow males to trust themselves, you like to tell them they will die a virgin and nobody loves them? Now thats some toxic shit."
147,hypepriest,"Tbh this just confirms what I've always thought incels. You're a bunch of normal looking dudes. 

You could totally get girls."

155,Administrative_Worth,Im organising one for melbourne australia. March 5th Friday. Special screening of the joker. I will be in full homemade costume and makeup. Laughing hysterically when he kills someone or gets the detectives bludgeoned etc.
156,username_suggestion4,This looks significantly better than an average reddit meetup lmao.
157,Wifeashamedofme,Ironically also the most multiracial Reddit meetup of all. JFL at being accused of being “white supremacists” by Inceltears. IT meetups look like the KKK compared to this.
158,Wifeashamedofme,"It’s well known that incels are on average better looking than IT soys. Even IT acknowledges this when they say that incels don’t look too bad. 

The problem however is that we are not good looking enough for women in 2020. Inceldom is an artificial phenomenon generated by abnormal levels of lookism and hypergamy among females. There is actually nothing inherently wrong with the majority of incels, even personality wise, its just that society is shit."
159,Reddit_es_muy_homo,Not enough blubber and pink hair
160,emsyphine,"I woke up very early from a nightmare and as usual the racing thoughts kept me from falling asleep again.

I thought of all of you, of your pain and loneliness. I lurk on this subreddit out of curiosity and maybe because I saw this photo last night and now know what you look like, I feel much more connected to you. I wanted so desperately to be able to hold you, to lie next to you with my head on your chest. To kiss you softly and for you to stroke my hair as I fall asleep. I wanted to feel your body next to mine and I wanted to make love to you; I thought about how my love might make a difference and might be able to heal some of your pain.

My pillow was wet with tears as I accepted my powerlessness and remembered the lines from one of my favourite poems:
“In everyone there sleeps   
A sense of life lived according to love.
To some it means the difference they could make   
By loving others, but across most it sweeps
As all they might have done had they been loved.   
That nothing cures.” ... the poem is called Faith Healing by Philip Larkin and you can read it for free online if you would like. I hope it helps you.

I am so sorry for all you are going through."
161,EzLunesta,what IT meetup? any links?
162,socracticoctopus,It's because it is fake. This is the Republicans club at UCSC. Check op's post history before you slurp lies up like the fucking sheep you are.
163,Neph_Dada,True. We actually have wives and children
164,Blubber_Whaling,"incelcon, there would be stalls for rope and realistic sex robots/VR"
165,ShahOfShinebox,Keynote speech by Houellebecq
166,ConnorGracie,The incel party.
167,Reddit_es_muy_homo,What about cocaine and strippers?
168,,And it defeats the narrative that incels are a bunch of white guys. In this pic there's about a 50/50 ratio of white and non-white incels...which is also the ratio on the various incel forums.
169,mrodder,Don't tell me this one is actually real?
170,noosecel,"\>  kind and wholesome.  

dont say that, this just fuels the redpill ""alpha badboy"" bullshit"
171,_Machine_Girl_,"But they are also all kids. I doubt there is a single dude over 25 there. Which explains a lot.

They are not evil, just immature and probably akward, kind of like a lot of homeschooled kids. I really feel bad for them"
172,fuckrule9,"Lmao atthis point they know that this group is more diverse than they say it is they just dont care. They want to make us look worse by telling everyone that we are all white/white supremacists. You will never see this image being posted there, because it doeasnt fuel their narrative of all incels being white.

And of that fails for them they just say that indians/asians are white supremacists too JFL"

188,you_are_on_steroids,You can tell they post misogyny online just by looking at them. It's their toxic aura. That's why they don't have a girlfriend.
189,Asleep-Beat,"After all the ""picture of the incel meetup last year"" memes where it was just like 10 chads, it's funny to see how we actually have meetups now."
190,ChaosGivesMeaning,Dude in the green shirt is a chad.

193,symplefellow,LIFEFUEL BROTHER HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
194,BettyCogburn,Because truecels wouldn’t show up to something like this unless they lowinhibmaxx which is extremely rare
195,slipintodystopia,"I don't know - some of them look pretty short. Let's say the tallest guy standing up (at left, with brown longish hair) is like 5'7"" or 8"" - that makes some those dudes like 5 foot even."

210,Asleep-Beat,can be organised
211,GoffSystemQB,Truecels aren't that common they are as common as Chads.  Most people aren't drop-dead ugly.  Around low-tier normie looking is the standard incel look.

224,Asleep-Beat,"because they are just normal people at the end of the day. not what IT says; not fucking massive overweight neckbeards, the majority are just normal guys who you see in day to day life. yet they struggle with women, and the high standards that have plagued their lives and reduced them to loneliness. they should be normal and have normal lives, but hypergamy rejects that promise"
225,xttamx,That’s because we fucking are LMAO. Women just hate us because of our looks and some people just downright refuse to believe women aren’t perfect.

253,FFS_IsThisNameTaken2,"Society can be shit, yes. 

I have to wonder, though, what types of women incels are trying to go out with. There are normal women, and then there are the ones who really are shit. As a normal, but apparently weird woman by societal measures apparently, I don't even like being around women who put all their time and effort into selfies, fake lashes, latest and greatest fads, social media drama, putting everything on credit and pretending to have more money than they do, all the while looking down on other people for not being as fake as them.

So, are the fake ass gold digger types the ones incels are trying for? They're bitches. Why waste the time? 

*Disclaimer: I'm a midle aged woman, and just recently heard about the bitches who use dating apps for free fucking food. Fuck that shit! If I were a guy on one of those apps, I'd insist on going Dutch the first date at least (maybe 1st 3) to weed out those types of freeloaders. On the same token, guys expecting sex after paying for a date is making the date a hooker, so they should skip the date and get a hooker instead. A date should not be a business transaction. It should be a time to get to know another person, and time should be the investment.

Jocko Willink is a retired Navy Seal and he hosts his own podcast nowadays.  Part of his leadership philosophy is sometimes you have to fake it to win.  That means you take those attributes above, swallow your pride, and apply them to everyone, even the ugliest, fattest girls, to the most resentful, pitiful men.  After awhile, you become that guy every likes, including the more desirable women.

It's autism, not shitty looks, that turns girls off more than anything else.

344,ChaosGivesMeaning,"Height-wise sure, that prevents him from being chad/chadlite depending on how exactly how short he is, but facially he's at least chadlite. Normie product-kept haircut/easily curtailed hairline recession, low cheekbones but strong ocee curve, ideal skin and hair colour with no skincare flaws, very strong ramus/defined jawline, no chin fat/doublechin, chin projection is visibly forward/opposite of recessed even from a frontal view, nasolabial folds look aged but that's attributable to him smiling, sellion/subnasal area are both the ideal masculine plane slope (even from the front you can tell), little to no facial dystrophy, solid FWHR and literally perfect general rule of thirds facial harmony, neutral canthal tilt....

The only downsides are height/frame/neck width (neck width is modifiable to a decent extent with muscle training, it's not immutable like other features), and assymetrical eye proportions. Brow ridge is extremely average. The dude is at least a chadlite, even if you want to reserve the term 'chad' for people who have hunter eyes etc. (every good + rare feature with virtually no flaws), which is bordering on lookism tier standards (lookism's prominent posters self-admitted at times to being slightly exaggerative in their assessments of what \*practically\* constitutes a good looking guy relative to the rest of an average crowd in day to day public life. You don't have to be a Gigachad to qualify as chad.).

Granted, he might have autism, and yeah, if you have a strong neuro-social disorder as a man, it's extremely difficult to spin that into any sort of positively charismatic connotation, whereas for women, unless they're overweight (and even then, depending on the degree of desperation coming from their male circles...), any such awkwardness is inherently biased as being perceivably 'quirky' and thus endearing--so sure, based on unknown invisible characteristics pertaining to the social element of this guy, we could presume that he might be restricted, but the problem with this type of naval-gazing is that it is remarkably similar to the 'personality' gaslighting that IT posters employ--in the sense that, without direct information from the man himself, there's no way to know, other than obviously acknowledging the possible difficulty having autism would bring to the table as well as the discrepant gender biases that are societally involved, but at that point, it's more of a systemic critique than anything particularly observational.

Also lastly, at the risk of being murdered due to the name of this subreddit, I'll take the controversial stance in the endless and classical debate: FACE > HEIGHT. (you can always run ogre game if you are exceptionally tall AND possess a wide frame, regardless of your face, but barring that, the face is more important on average... although the cutoff to this is around 5'4 or below, which the guy in the green shirt, I suppose, could very well be, although I don't specifically know if he's 5'4 or less, even if he's noticeably shorter than the other people in this picture; as none of us have a direct, exact way of measuring this dude's height.)."

More experience has taught me that girls calling guys cute is normally a more polite way of saying hot or handsome.

You literally destroyed your own argument. These guys are mostly cuties, therefore the issue is their personalities cause they are probably somewhat like you. If we are talking looks I am a former model(and not of Insta thot, camwhore variety) and I would not mind to date a number of them if looks were the only thing that mattered.

. And it's funny how you talk about women like they are a Borg collective, it's like if a 5/10 girl salivates over a gymbro Chad and wonders why she can't score. Does that mean all men are chads or there is something wrong with the girls expectations?
Half of incels want to fuck Stacies and just want big boobs and small brains and then claim how women are the problem and not their dhitty shallow taste and a simpleton worldview that lacks depth and perspective. Imagine dating a feminist who constantly self loathes and bitches that the patriarchy is keeping her down, even if she was hot most would not like her long or want to spend time around her, thats how most incels feel to women.


Edit: I would also like to mention that I genuinely don't hate incels and their problems don't amuse me,I really feel bad for the guys, I don't for a second think of them as bad people or even that stupid, just controlled by somewhat understandable frustrations, they have their assholes like any other group but in general they are not,I hope they will overcome themselves and the issues they are facing."

Just the same, if you're 5'6 with a very handsome face, you're going to have a lot more of a chance than a dude that's 5'0"" or 5'1"" with a very handsome face. A lot more.

He doesn't have that good bone structure to be honest, but he has good skin and hair.  I'm not going to respond to the lookism theory stuff, but facial harmony is what matters.  You can tell a face is attractive by looking at it aside from individual features. 

This is an example of chadlite.  

https://incels.co/threads/this-what-an-incel-looks-like-sub-8-deniers-gtfih.177600/

You have to remember that chads are T5%.  Chadlites T20% at best.  There are so many guys in my calc 3 class that mog the fuck out of that dude right now at least 3 all are chadlites.  

At best the case you can make is that he's high-tier normie. 

I'd like to see a picture of him not smiling because unironically it makes him look goofy.

397,ChaosGivesMeaning,"His facial harmony isn't bad though (if you believe it is, I'm interested in hearing your elaboration, as I would wager that his face is conventionally/traditionally attractive enough). I also don't see how his bone structure is poor, it's not astonishing (no strong zygos etc.) but it's not bad, it's akin to lookism user Orb's magnitude of 'bones'; I would also disagree with the linked person being a chadlite, especially considering filters etc. unless you consider k-pop looking people to be chadlite, as opposed to more traditional structures of masculine aesthetics. But regardless, the person you linked isn't even an example of sub 8 theory; I'd agree that he is sub 8 (probably a 7 or a 6 by brutal standards), but someone like that is easily capable of getting laid even in the era of tiktok/tinder standards. Whatever issues that guy has, they aren't predominantly going to be due to his face. Though I'd have to ask, do you subscribe to sub 8 theory (assuming we discredit or ignore low inhib)? I personally think that in reality it plays out much more closely to sub 7.

I do agree however that if green shirt guy's eye symmetry is that bad by default, then he's unattractive, but due to the smile, it makes it hard to evaluate his actual nasolabial folds and eye symmetry. Also going by %, this guy would fit the chadlite bill.  And I'm pretty sure there is a correlation with height halo'ing a person's overall appearance, but that's retroactive in relation to the way that a person sees a face, the general focal point is the face by default. Being 6'5 is always going to be a net positive, hence turnout at places like nightclubs etc., but having an attractive face will intrinsically be sufficient unless you're freakishly short, moreso than height given that the predominance of people who are 6'5+ is minor compared to those who have attractive faces. But even setting quantity aside, within reality you'll typically observe that so long as the male is the taller of the two in any given couple (which does not require overall tallness to begin with), the face is the primary factor."

403,evilcel,"It depends on the person, but generally you would be considered lean at 10%-13%. Higher than that can look lean if you have enough muscle and good body fat distribution genetics, but most people will look average (ie: not lean, but not fat) in the 14%-18% range so long as they have been lifting for at least several months. Beyond that you might start considering yourself chubby or, depending on your fat distribution genetics, may have a certain area that is fatter than you'd prefer.

To give an example I am 5'8, 150 lbs, and probably around the 18% area. I hold a lot of my body fat in my low back which gives me a muffin top, but despite that I don't look fat, just a little chubby in that particular area.

All that said if you get into the fitness world then the standards shift quite a lot with 15% being considered 'fat' to many people that lift and are part of the fitness world. So if you are getting into fitness always remember that the standard you should set for yourself should not be the one the professional models and bodybuilders set for themselves."
404,FFS_IsThisNameTaken2,"I never liked Chad. He was an asshole and so was his gf, but what I didn't do was insist on Chad wanting me. Jfc lol, no! 

Funny thing is, looking at the Chad's of my day on social media now, makes me so grateful I was not one of them.

Have a good night. I'm not going to beg you to quit looking so hard so that you can actually find what you're looking for."
405,deadmanwalking124,Which borrough you from?
406,deadmanwalking124,"Yeah, I wanna uproot"
407,Wifeashamedofme,Unironically balls as giant as Jeremy Meeks. These Incels are true inner chads.
408,ShahOfShinebox,"Respect bro 

Out of curiosity though, did you hesitate in choosing to show up? I’m honest with people about my lack of dating, and I will defend incels and lonely hearts, but there’s no way I’d tell people this is where I spend my time on the Internet let alone show up to a meeting"
409,pig_farming,Fugg man. Balls of steel.
410,GoffSystemQB,"I dont proscribe to sub 8 theory.  I'm sub7/sub6 theory.  I just gave an example of one.  

Pretty boys with somewhat decent jawline are pretty much the quintessential example of chadlites.  He might even be able to looksmaxx pass as a chad in his generation to be honest because Zoomer chad = prettyboy, but all those TikToc fags may just not be grown up.  

The guys facial harmony is bad because of his asymmetry.  I also think his face shape/frame makes him look worse.

If you dont think that tiktok guy mogs the fuck out of him send to some girls and ask them to choose.  Get a close up of that guys picture so you can see his asymmetry.

You're wrong if face was most important club would be filled with 5'8-5'10 chadlets.  Reality is people not perceive your face especially fron a straight angle all the time but your size/height is.  .Girls go up to guys in clubs just based on height."
411,Administrative_Worth,Its a 100 normies. 30 arthouse cinema fags. And me
412,Administrative_Worth,"No you misunderstand. This cinema plays very okd classics and new very good movies. 

Has a cult audience. Theres a few film schools in the area. Its an old late 1800s early 1900s cinema. Marble entrance. Double story. Old wooden floorboars and leather seats. 

Those 100-150 are not invoted by me. Theres a few incel tier guys who go of their own accord. This place actualky played joker every night for 3 weeks. Its a one movie a day place. 

But most atyendees are normies looking for a nice old fashioned cinema. 

But i go to watch the old conan the barbarian. Heaps of gymcels that night. Guys who know the words and go wild. 

This will be my first time orhanising a group outside of my normfag friends."
413,Administrative_Worth,"I had to cancel it. The publicity of shortcels and lmsc had a mole. And melbourne is full of soys. There could have been some soy rock up and statt a conflict or worse maybe an acid attacj. 

On the bright side i know another cel rocked up and was laughing out loud at every killing with me on the ither side of the cinema"
414,HeartofDestiny,"> Cute men have sex all the time

They why are these so called cute men at an incel meet up?

> where the fuck do you get these “stats”

Go to r/ladyboners and you will see women want the exact same guy, tall, white, masculine jaw and eye area.
There no cute guys to be see on that page they are all masculine."
415,MinutiaDio,"Nice info, I'm actually trying to start working out so this helps a but. I'm 6'5 and 145 dripping wet. Looming to put on fat and then tone it into muscle :)"

417,AndersonxCooper,"Nope, thought it was hilarious 
 
I knew it was just gonna be regular cool relateable bro’s, the way incels are portrayed in reddit usually doesn’t translate to real life begins."
418,ChaosGivesMeaning,"See I don't think we disagree intensely here, the problem/dispute is mostly just whether or not the guy's facial asymmetry actually is that bad or if it's just a smile distorting it. Where we do fundamentally seem to differ though is the height / face dispute, which is typical within incel communities, as it often seems to come down to anecdotal experience, because where I live the club actually \*is\* filled with 5'8-5'10 dudes who are successful, same with bars. \*granted\*, my location is somewhere within Canada wherein the height average is of a lower threshold overall, so that may skew it, but who knows."
419,wltrjr,"Right
Acid Attacks, No no"
420,lunafox999,The Guys on that photo are cute enough for me. Ur very fucking stupid if you think women don’t like cute guys.
421,sh1nycat,"Ok, that sub is not even as unrealistic as the porn guys look at. 

On to real life advice, no one is having sex with you because you have a shitty attitude. You appear to be more concerned with using a woman as a masturbation aid than actually connecting with someone, and that is creepy.  *creepy* does not get laid easily.

A hot body may be fun to look at, and for SOME women, it might matter, just like SOME guys think they should only get laid by supermodels. But you are selling yourself short with all these generalizations about ""women want only this"". You have all of these fabricated theories created to help you deal with rejection, and I'm sorry you were hurt, but that is life. Everyone needs to grow and learn from those experiences, not use them to make assumptions about how half of the human population just hate you because you dont have rippling biceps. It's that shitty ass attitude that's your cockblock."
422,lunafox999,And cute guys CAN be masculine. Stop that hyper masculinity shit that you have to be “hot” for women to like you or find you attractive. Lmaooo and that’s not a statistic.
423,squidoe,i think guys that arent masculine are super hot but okay
424,barrymore479,Not true at all....I fuck with cute men so hard ...
425,evilcel,"That's not how it works. Fat does not become muscle. They are completely separate things. Put on as little fat as you can manage.

Do you have a program that you are looking to follow? I can recommend a few. beginners programs to you. You will also need to make sure you get your diet in check. You can't outlift a bad diet. Gains happen as much in the kitchen as they do in the gym."

427,BLACKEDpill,So you live in jersey?
428,ShahOfShinebox,"That’s awesome man 

Did you guys figure out who was the organizer of the event that put up the fliers?"
429,Administrative_Worth,"I questioned whether ut was rational to be so suspect. But i had to balance melbourne is a city full of soys. I knew at least 1 IT user confirmed was in my academic class last year. 
And that they feel justified in hurting anyone who thinks differently to thenselves. Because they dont see you as a person. 

I can legit imagibe one of them prepping sone acid and todsing it mid movie at the group of guys cheering. Tossing it in someones face and saying, now youre a truecel. 

Some shit like that."
430,HeartofDestiny,"Then why are they at an incel meet up yo dumb fuck? none of them are getting sex.
Where are all the masculine looking men in this photo?"
431,HeartofDestiny,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Stop lying dumbass."
432,MinutiaDio,I mean I know how fat works and I'm not so much looking to get healthy it's an appearance thing. I just know it's easier to gain fat a opposed to muscle so I wanted to start there first.
433,,"You must know how much suifuel NYC is with so many 6'2""+ white chad financebros running around.

The hard drive contained many nuclear blackpills; even some that had only been seen by the greatest of Wizards. The ancients left many anthropological imprints within the ruins of what was once a great land of plenty, but is now just a distant reminiscent of the past. . ."

""telling him"" instead of ""they're making fun of ME"" jfl this is basic english deduction. And why would he even try to bring attention to himself there?

You wake up every morning and your ugliness is not only reaffirmed by looking in the mirror but by women irl and on social media. Being told that because of the way your face looks or how short your stature is that you aren't a real man, that you don't deserve love. Being socially isolated and lonely because women decided that you deserve to rot for being born a certain way. 


It wasn't his fault. None of it was your brocel's fault. Society isolated him and made him lonely. Society failed him. Society, women in particular, are constantly bullying men and isolating men who aren't conventionally attractive. We only have each other in this shit world. Stay strong.

Women can be short, tall, ugly or even extremely ugly, that they'll still find some average looking dude who'll worship her like a Queen.

But us short / ugly dudes are just fucked to the core.

I'm pretty good looking (girls have told me that MANY time) but they never really want to be in a relationship due to the fact i'm short. 


Shit, man, i even have a good looking body, i'm a kickboxer for over 5 years and been to the gym going hard for 2 years. Unfortunately all i get is ""haha manlet"".


Some people say being short is fine and that you'll find someone who doesn't mind, but that's a fucking lie, mainly due to the fact that being short ruins your self-esteem right off the bat.


To make things worse, i ALWAYS loved sports such as volleyball and basketball, but guess what? I could never succeed due to being short.


If i wasn't at least attractive face-wise, i'd probably just stick myself into a corner at home and just play games for the rest of my life.

If you believe that you cannot fix the reason why you don't have a girlfriend then you won't be able to fix it. Am I wrong to guess that you're awkward around girls? Maybe don't understand how to talk to them, what they mean, think they're confusing people? It's because you don't understand women, but luckily it's easy to learn

Girl at party (I think she was around 5ft3, but obviously I didn't measure her exact height): ""I feel so sorry for men my height. It would be impossible for them to find a girlfriend.""

4 women (all doctors) in work, discussing dating. One of them was showing pictures from Tinder, and they all agreed the guy was attractive. The woman showing the pictures then said, ""Oh actually, he's really short"". The other 3 all made comments along the lines of ""ugh"", ""how disappointing"" etc etc.

I used to be single for a really long time because I couldn't find anyone that was interested in me, so I downloaded Tinder so I could exclusively talk to people that are into me.

If you're single it's not because you're shorter. A lot of people have trouble with realizing that people judge you for your actions and not your intent, so maybe try to come off as a nicer and a more positive person. I'm not saying that you just shouldn't be sad, but just wearing a smile (even if it's not genuine) can go a long way.

>you all think you deserve women to like you despite being sexist pricks

Niceguys strawman, and also some just world fallacy bullshit. First, no one is entitled to anything, just as we aren’t entitled to being treated like humans. Likewise, we are also not entitled to women being attracted to us if we are genetic trash. This is irrefutable logic.

You say you're short so you don't get laid, yet people shorter than you still get laid.

Funny how you don't examine any of your own statements the way you do other things.

It's almost like, and this is a big thought so try real hard to understand, there are multiple factors to things sometimes! Like maybe it's easier for a misogynist to get women if they're also attractive, and it's easier for a short guy to get women if they aren't a misogynist, so taking the one factor that's out of your control and saying ""this is the entire problem"" while ignoring all the shit that is in fact your fault is really just an easy way to avoid blaming yourself for anything at all.

There are short men who get laid, so being short *fucking obviously* isn't your only problem and pretending that it is is not logical. There's also ugly men who do, and any other excuse you think you have that doesn't come down to your personality."
1001,,"> How come misogyny is an inhibiting factor for us but not for them?

Probably because when they get rejected for being assholes, they don't go sit in a little echo chamber and cry like little bitches to all the other sexists. They go find more women until one is unlucky enough to fall for it.

If you want to apply your own logic here, people shorter than you still get laid. If height is the only inhibiting factor, how does that work?  Oh yeah, *it's because you're also twats*. If you seriously think being short is the only reason you don't get laid, and it's nothing to do with your toxic, shitty personality you are fucking delusional.

1022,tr0llbunny,"On female hypergamy: 


In a large population survey, males with much lower income than their wives were 2.27 times as likely not to have sex.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-017-0968-7 (Kim 2017)

Women’s income was correlated with the income that they wanted in an ideal mate (r = .31), his educational (r = .29) and professional status (r = .35), i.e. women with higher income expressed an even stronger preference for high-earning men than did women who were less financially successful.

https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-103408 (Buss 2018)

Since 1980, women increasingly marry down in education, but the tendency for women to marry men with higher incomes than themselves persisted. The findings suggest that men and women continue to form marriages in which the wife’s socioeconomic status does not exceed that of the husband.

https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ETD_SUBID:113754 (Qian 2016)

Unmarried college-educated women between the ages of 40 and 64 earn an average of 17.5 percent more than their male peers.

In a large US sample, high status men (especially of lower IQ) have ~18% more children compared to low status men, whereas high status women have ~40% fewer children compared to low status women. A reason might be that high status women struggle to find men of even higher status.

Using economic modeling, the tendency that the husband has a greater human capital than the wife (hypergamy), can be formally derived from the premise that women can sell exclusive access to sex because men want to be certain about their biological fatherhood and that men can sell their amassed resources because women need them.

Research results that found a strong link between facial symmetry and health have been exposed as scientific fraud:

https://www.the-scientist.com/features/a-fluctuating-reality-46903

Highly specific markers of attractiveness, e.g. facial symmetry, a deep voice, chiseled chin, women's hourglass figure etc. are largely unrelated to health and ability.

Our strong preference for these features has likely evolved in a positive feedback loop (Fisherian runaway and sensory bias hypothesis), not because they signal health or ability.

(This does not hold for all aspects of attractiveness though, e.g. aversion toward irregular skin might have evolved to avoid infectious diseases. Such adaptations useful for survival might have initiated the runaway selection.)

https://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Beauty-Darwins-Forgotten-Theory/dp/0385537212 (Prum 2017)

The feedback loop consists in one sex evolving to be more attracted to a particular feature in the other sex for the mere reason that it is selected by others, but as the population overall evolves stronger attraction to the feature, the evolutionary pressure grows exponentially to be even more attracted to the feature. This results in exaggeration or overcomplication of said feature in the other sex in efforts to evolve to become more attractive.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherian_runaway

Human's cognitive abilities and all sorts of complex social behavior and courtship behaviors may have evolved in the same way as they are unnecessarily sophisticated for the needs of hunter-gatherers to survive.

Funny how you keep parroting “personaliteehee”, yet have 0 scientific evidence to back up women being attracted to personality. It’s almost as if you have no argument at all. The following is not even a tenth of the full blackpill: 

Within races, the inter-rater agreement on physical attractiveness is very high, typically Cronbach's α > .9. Across races it is only slightly lower.

There is lots of variance in ratings of averagely looking people (SD of ~2-3 on a 10-point scale), but very little variance in ratings of very attractive or very unattractive people, i.e. people strongly agree about the extremes.

http://doi.org/10.1177/1948550617732388 (Palomares 2017)

In a blind date setting, the correlation between evaluation of the date's physical attractiveness and liking of the date was .78 when male subjects rated their date, and .69 for when female subjects rated their date. Personality and intellect played no role.

Women judged and valued men based on physical attractiveness to the same degree as men did women.

In long-term dating settings, other factors besides looks do play a role (especially social status of males).

Chickens trained to pick either a masculine or feminine face more often picked exaggerated masculine or feminine faces to the same extent as humans of the opposite sex considered the faces more sexually desirable (r² = .98).

The preference for exaggerated masculinity or femininity is thus likely a neurological/mathematical necessity rather than a cultural option.

There you have it. According to you, the problem is not sexism, assholery, or misogyny, but perseverance. Now then, riddle me this: how is misogyny relevant in any shape or form to the subject?

Now before you say being a misogynist reduces your potential dating pool, ponder this for a moment: if not being misogynistic magically makes women attracted to you, then forgot dating us, how come we were treated like subhumans when we weren’t misogynistic?

>height is the only inhibiting factor

Said no one ever. There is extensive scientific evidence documenting the importance of height, frame size, jaw size, hairline, etc in sexual attraction. Furthermore, there is no evidence showing that a good personality matters in sexual attraction, but there is extensive evidence showing that women tend to be more attracted to “dark triad” traits aka being an asshole. Should you wish for the evidence I can procure it anytime.

One by one, we came together to try to make sense of our experiences, but, wait, they’re saying mean things about women! How dare they! We express our discontent and NOW you care about us? Brand us the asshole to absolve yourselves of responsibility? FUCK OFF"

1061,AnonymousDoctor99,"Thank-you for the kind words, I appreciate them.

People's responses can be a bit inconsistent though, can't they? For example, in this post, you've told me to be less negative about myself. And yet in my post, I also claimed to be smart, and someone else criticised me for ""arrogance"".

Seems like I can't win, haha!"
1062,AnonymousDoctor99,"I'm a realist. I'm honest. I'm ugly, so I admit it. I'm above average intelligence, so I admit it. (I don't claim to be any sort of ""special genius"", I'm just saying I'm above average. I have a medical degree from Oxford University, I think it's a legitimate claim to make.)

If I was saying only negative things about myself, you'd probably tell me I was ""unconfident"", and that ""women can detect your low self esteem"". And yet when I claim to be intelligent, I'm suddenly ""arrogant""? 

I literally can't win here. 

And obviously I don't walk around in real life talking about being ""ugly"" or ""above average intelligence"". I never mention any of that stuff in real life, I'm a sensible guy and know those aren't socially acceptable things to discuss! Besides, given that I'm happy to admit my negatives (such as my physical appearance), do you not think if I was considered a dickhead that I'd just be honest and admit that too?

Anyway, I'm not basing my views on anecdote. Here's a study where 96% of female participants would refuse to date a shorter man: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.532.1096&rep=rep1&type=pdf

There are also many other research papers discussing the negatives of short height in dating.

Obviously references to my own life (such as me claiming that I'm ugly, and claiming that I have friends) are going to be ""anecdotal"", because they can't possibly be anything else.

I have no interest in making up lies on the internet. I'm posting on an incel forum here, that's about as pathetic as it gets. So I'm not posting here to try to ""big myself up"" or make myself look good. I can assure you that I am not considered a dickhead. I have no issue making friends with women. I'm just never considered sexually attractive. Clearly that is nobody's ""fault"", and I'm not trying to blame anyone or claim that it's ""unfair"", I'm just stating a fact.

(And no, most of my staff reviews are from equals/seniors. Very few are from people junior to me. If people don't like you, it's very easy to just say nothing if they don't want to ""rock the boat"". In my case, my colleagues specifically write loads of positive comments that they are under no obligation to make. I can assure you that people in real life know me better than you do, who has apparently judged my character from a few online comments.)"
1063,arinskyy,haha retard says anecdote fallacy and refuses the statistics
1064,AnonymousDoctor99,"I'm not sure if ""superior"" is a word I would use to describe myself!

Some people are better looking than others, some people are smarter than others etc. I'm just trying to honestly describe myself. I think it's fair to say that I'm below average physically, and above average intellectually. As I say, there are HUGE numbers of people out there who are smarter than I am, I certainly would never claim to be especially gifted, because I know I am not. I find it kind of weird that people seem so outraged by that comment. 

As I say, I obviously do not walk around in real life discussing my appearance/intelligence. I'm a sensible person. I understand that would be incredibly weird.

If you want to think this makes me an asshole, then that's fine. But I don't think continuing this conversation would be productive in that case."
1065,locomojoyolo,"I'm not sure why stating to be above average in regard of intellect is less noble than admitting to be above average fitness, could you elaborateß"
1066,arshdeep1251,"1. Most people who have healthy social lives and relationships aren’t kind accepting souls. Most of them have slightly racist / homophobic/ transphobic views

2. Me personally I really don’t care about trannies or gays anymore . I don’t hate them I just don’t want it forced down peoples throat. However most normal people don’t like  the lgbt community either or at least aren’t avid supporters. Most normal people are against transgenders and still have relationships. I do feel sad for the bullying transgenders go through so I can relate but like I said I don’t want it forced down my throat

3. My descent into inceldom has changed the way I view woman to an extent . I can now understand that majority of woman don’t find me attractive and hypergamy has resulted in women around my level who match me in looks dating people much better looking than them. Despite the sexual revolution and women having more sexual freedom as the years progress the number of males being virgins in their adulthood is increasing."

Crazy how people react once you start calling them out on their bullshit. I remember the first time I said fuck it was after some ugly stumpy-ass white bitch started rubbing up on me at a club.

1595,galanticity,"Being fat is indicative of a lack of discipline and regard for personal health and by extension for overall society wellbeing since being overweight places a greater burden on the country's healthcare system which is often socially supported by wagies.

1599,incelthrowaway945,"Hi

The logic is consistent in that there are many proven ways to decrease your weight whereas the only option available to short men to increase their height is limb lengthening surgery which is incredibly expensive, painful and time consuming. The concept of height = attractiveness although not intentionally, diminishes the perceived attractiveness of ethnic peoples who on average are shorter. Short people are not physiologically impaired in anyway . Fat people however are fat due to lack of exercise/ control in eating their food. IT will screenshot this and find some article about obesity being linked to some gene or whatever but there are still ways for those people to lose weight. 

Rejecting someone due to their weight shouldn't be looked down on as obesity more often than not displays lack of self control/self discipline, plus if you're fat it means your health outcomes are shit (and Idc about your friend, cousin, grandma etc thats fat and lived to xx years). Rejecting someone because  of their height is the female prehistoric brain being retarded as usual and just reinforces the idea that western characteristics are attractive in a society where white people have evergthing going for them already.

Thanks for playing and I invite you or anyone over there on IT to reply/message me.

1603,madmasih,Ok but fat people are just as unattractive as short guys. And there's probably as many people who like short people as those who like fat people so you shouldn't be shitting on them for not being attractive when your whole community is based on ranting about not being attractive

1608,galanticity,"Again you are missing the crux of the issue which is about lack of personal agency in a world of genetic and environmental determinism. A person born with severe mental retardation can be just as poor as a person who got himself addicted to gambling and squandered all his money away, but the two aren't equivalent because they became poor through different means (unemployment vs screwing up your own life)

Now add on the fact that society has gambler acceptance movements to justify the lifestyles of the decadent and undisciplined gambler while at the same time making it socially acceptable and comedic to make fun of mentally challenged people in popular culture and social media, essentially giving those who gamble a get out of jail free card to ascend poverty while leaving the latter group as poor and discriminated against as ever.

1687,Saflik,"You're kind of describing the pre-2011 as well as the roughly pre-2004 internet. 

Really brings a lot of memories, doesn't it? The medium was a lot less accessible, not very streamlined, and a bit more of a dangerous place. Still, the communities were much more intimate and almost entirely male. If someone was claiming to be female, it was a safe assumption that they were lying. 

The internet was more feral, but it was more sober, intelligent, and ultimately the communities were more constructive. 

That started to change around 2004 when technology started to make the internet much less of a niche thing. Web 2.0, high-speed internet, going from megabyte-level storage to gigabyte. It was still predominantly male, but the unfairer sex was seeping in, albeit mostly within their own separate spaces that they found the most appealing.

When 2011 came, that's when things really got bad. The mobile revolution. The masses including the feminine masses poured in. Websites gradually became more sterile, prioritizing security and emotions over autonomy and common sense. Beyond that, I don't even need to say much, many of you probably have seen it for yourselves. 

Contrary to popular belief though, the internet is far from being tamed. Most internet users congregate on a relatively small cluster of websites, but the cyber-frontier is still there. There are plenty of spaces which are still intimate and male-dominated beyond Google's index. Not to mention still plenty of ways to get some privacy."

And they all want it. Theres a group of gym maxxed nornies i run into occasionally, and the ""alpha"" of the group is always trying to ""hold frame"" tries to be the big man. Doesnt move over to appropriate levels when walking past him. Bullshit like that. 

Happens to most gym maxxed normies. They begin to larp as chads. But everyone seea througg it. 
And they want to be chads so badly. They get desperate. They simp, they fashionmaxx and a whole range of other bullshit. In the hopes this works. This gets them over the line. 

Men would rather fuck each other over on the hope they can ascend and live a chad life, vs actively bamd together and cancel slut culture.

Nothing would change for most low value men no incentive to do so, atleast now they get something in exchange for their thirst/attention. That was basically useless before.

trust me i was around for the era of pre social media, yes if you had balls/social skills a semi low value man could get a decent looking woman easier, but the key word here is if they had balls , most of these dudes didnt have that courage/skills pre-social media or pose so nothing would change for them."

1845,TheRabbitTunnel,"I admire your attempt at a reasonable and logical discussion, so ill engage. 

Originally, you had good points that other people werent really addressing your argument. However, the person you just responded to did address your argument, and you failed to address his point. 

Sex work is an exploitative market where women profit off of a radically unequal society. The top men are drowning in pussy and the bottom men get nothing. 

Sex workers step in and offer a solution to this, at an insane price. ""Hey, if you pay me half of your paycheck for the week, ill sexually satisfy you for a few hours.""

They will *happily* pay to bang chad (indirectly, like paying to take him out to dinner), but wont touch you with a 10ft pole unless you spend a lot of money on her. 

And this is why they are immoral. They see an unfair market and capitalize on it. 

It would be one thing if they charged like $30 an hour or something(which is what they do in countries where prostitutiin is normalized). But, from what i know (i could be wrong), they charge something crazy like hundreds of dollars an hour, because there are so many men desperate enough to pay it, because of the radical sexual inequality between men. Which is a result of womens standards. 

Plenty of useful things, like anti depressants, anti anxiety meds, birth control, etc are important but not necessary for survival. So is sex. If its exploitative to charge hundreds of dollars for a monthly perscription like anti depressants or birth control, why is it not exploitative to charge hundreds of dollars for an hour or two or sex? 

Look at any given sex worker. Lets forget that shes a sex worker and just look at her personality. She is sexually disgusted by you, and wouldnt even consider anything sexual with you unless you were willing to pay her insane amounts of money. Meanwhile, she bends over backwards for chad (literally and figuratively). Not only does she constantly pursue him and fuck him for free (and probably lets him do whatever he wants in bed, no matter how degrading it is), but she would indirectly pay for it. Women will happily pay for a date with chad, drive him to drug deals, etc. 

Yet, that same women thinks so low of you that she wants hundreds of dollars just to allow you to get some starfish sex. If Chad slaps her ass, its ""harmless flirting."" If you ask for her number, its harassment. 

So, while people generally deserve basic human decency and respect, why is it that you think a sex worker deserves the same respect as others? 

With non sex workers, at least they arent being exploitative. At least theyre saying ""this is my sexual preference and Im sticking to it."" With sex workers, they say ""nah im ok with letting you rail me, but dont even think about it until i see $300 bucks! Otherwise, get lost loser."" Thats pretty shitty."

1850,OneResitBoi,"If and when they are disrespecting you, then it's that action of disrespect that you should want to hate and argue with. The stripping and prostitution doesn't and shouldn't matter as it's irrelevant to their disrespect for you. 

Why do you target strippers and prostitutes (who may or may not disrespect you; it's an ""anti-cope"" to think that every prostitute/foid in the world disrespects you) when you could instead target those who directly disrespect you?"

1854,Gumblar_net,I’m too tired to come up with one.
1855,TheRabbitTunnel,"I dont think theres much wrong with being a prostitute if youre in a shitty situation where you desperately need the money, like these 3rd world wonen that youre talking about. Nor do I see a problem with reasonably priced prostititues. From what I know, countries where prostitution is normalized has women working for like $25 an hour or something like that. Clearly, its not an issue of ""Im not willing to do this for $25 an hour"", its ""i know very lonely men will give me tons of money, so Ill charge that, even though i could charge way less and still make a good amount of money"" 

Your fisherman and hair salon analogies arent really an accurate representation. Heres a better analogy - a fisherman usually charges $10 per fish to his customers. But some people have an unfortunate condition where they can only eat fish, and are willing to pay much more out of desperation. When the fisherman knows that one of these people is buying, he adds a zero to the price tag so its $100. 

Similarly, the hair stylist decides she will charge 200 for a haircut instead of 20 if she knows that the person desperately needs it (important job interview coming up, or whatever). 

Regarding the role reverse, if I could get almost any woman I wanted, id just sleep with the ones I want. I wouldnt say to the bottom girls ""hey if you give me half of this weeks paycheck, ill plow you for a few hours.""

I agree with you that sex workers are people who deserve basic decency, but its just plain false to say theres nothing immoral or exploitative about what they do."

1859,TheRabbitTunnel,"1. Yeah

2. Exploitation is not limited to life and death. Hence my perscription example. Anti depressants arent necessary for survival or a human right, but they improve quality of life. So is it exploitative to charge hundreds of dollars for 1 small bottle? Yes. Sex isnt necessary or a human right, but it improves quality of life. Its exploitative to overcharge. 

3. What?"
1860,,[deleted]
1861,TheRabbitTunnel,"You do bring up good points. ""As a prostitute who doesnt wanna be a prostitute, is it immoral to charge a lot so that you can leave ASAP?"" I think it would be, but much less so than if she was financially well off. 

I think msny of the other commenters are taking it way too far, and are probably just letting out anger. Anger that a gynocentric society coddles women and treats men as disposible, yet has the nerve to bitch about ""sex workers not getting enough respect."" 

They do deserve basic humsn decency, its not like theyre below human. But what they do is also questionable. Its extremely frustrating for men (who have been treated like trash by society) to have to listen to people say stupid shit like ""respect sex workers"", the very same workers exploiting these lonely men that society treats like trash. 

So yeah, Id say the radical comments in this thread are a result of that anger just being let out. 

Again, you made some good points. Based on your last comment, I think we are in agreement."

My aunt and uncle who I visit here and there have this dog that just doesn't stop licking and when you first get there: this dog is going to lick you: your shoes, your arms, your pants - so you might end up getting a lick on a cheek before you push her away, but actively letting it lick in your mouth? Fucking gnarly.

Despite people saying dog's mouths are much cleaner than humans - [that's a total myth](https://www.petmd.com/dog/pet-lover/are-dogs-mouths-cleaner-humans-mouths). There are hundreds of unique bacteria in dog saliva like with human saliva, but far worse, there are actually parasites than can be passed to humans through their saliva that can impact your health, which is why you definitely shouldn't let a dog make out with you."

2193,hades_the_wise,"I know all about it.  The world is an inherently unfair place, and some of us aren't privileged with being tall or naturally good-looking.  Some of us have severe anxiety that makes it hard to figure out how to talk to women, some of us are just genuinely dealt a short straw.  I was dealt a few short straws - being short, balding in my 20s, and having crippling anxiety - and used to hang out in these communities and have a self-defeating mindset of ""I'm never gonna get laid, women are cruel, woe is me"", etc.  I decided one day that that mindset was holding me back and discarded it.  I'm still single, but I've had a couple of fulfilling relationships since then and things are generally on an upward trend for me.  I've figured out how to package what I've got in the most appealing way, and a wonderful therapist has helped me *tons* with the anxiety.  At some point, you just play the cards you're dealt, and the fact is, the majority of us aren't dealt *that* bad of a hand - if you put in effort, you can have a worthwhile and enjoyable life with what you've got.

And yeah, about the whole unfair towards men thing - there's an economics angle where you could say that supply and demand favors women.  I get that.  But it also hurts them - they're viewed as property in most of the world, and even here in the states, they're much more disposed to harassment and rape.  The price of being on the ""supply"" side of the supply-and-demand relationship.  That's why I choose to view sex and relationships as mutual trade - both partners supply.  Neither is a product or property or should ever be treated as such."

2200,veganrobhood,"I have discarded the ""mindset"" before. Tried to work on myself, hit on hundreds of women. I got nothing, nothing. So, it is not me who needs to drop the mindset. It is women who need to drop the hypergamy. When women have a boat load of men who want to date them, they aren't going to go for the unattractive ones. They're going to pick the ones most attractive physically and leave the ones who aren't attractive in the dirt to rot. 

Here's a study showing women prefer men who are bigger, taller, and have broad shoulders than men who do not. Study also shows women prefer someone with a large penis.

https://www.pnas.org/content/110/17/6925.full

Hypergamy is also made much worse thanks to online dating. Women only consider 20% of men attractive on these sites and that's who they go for. Men have a much higher rating of women, then women do men. 


Here's a study showing that men rate women higher than women rate men.

You brought up harassment and rape and you and I both can agree that those are problems with being given endless amounts of validation and options. Though I have to ask, would you rather be a part of a group that is almost never lonely and has endless options, or would you rather be part of lonely group that gets almost no validation and no options. I agree with you when you say that being of the supply side grants you some negatives. But being a women in the western world, the positives of social validation outweigh the very low potential negatives of rape. Women would much rather have validation than not."

Ill put it out there. Not all women are like that. 
Its just about 97% of them. The other 3% are usually victims of some heaby trauma or child abuse that has forced them to grow up.

Women in the west never have to develop beyond age 16 until they hit about age 45. 
From 16-45 men simp and simp and simp for them. Kind interactions. Favours. Money. Whatever. Without stimulus there is no growth. Its also why most chads who have always been chads are narcisstic shits. They are effectively children who live on the top of a pyramid away from thw worlds woes and evils. 

Low value men. People with severe disabilities. Immigrants fresh off the boat, child abuse victims. They see the world for what it is and are forced to grow to deal with it. Or they suffer even more. 

At age 45+ women usually grow bitter. They thinl men are pigs. That they get mistreated. Its only that men stop simping. Gravy train slows down. And they have to grow up again. 

Most women are children. Their desires and wants are mostly that of a 16 year old girls fantasies. Chad. Rich house or apartment. Alcohol and mdma and cocaine. Glamorous clothes or art or some other ""identity"" 

The female brain by and large is average. Ita survivally built like that. Because they have never had to stand out to survive. They just have to be of acceptable level and theyll pass on their genes. 

Its why most of then are alike or just subsets of each other. The meme gender. Meme being its proper use, a trope and colloquial idea. Art hoe. Hippie bush doof hoe. Rich kid hoe. Nightclub hoe. Bar slut. University tinder slut. 

80% of girls fit one of those. 

And in our cushioned western world most normie men and above are stereotypes too. 

True art is dying. Art is a beautiful perversion of the mind. Something that can only be born of true deep pain. But most artists these days are foids usually producing a derivative piece of aesthetics vs art, and normie or chad males doing the same."

2403,Wifeashamedofme,"there was a small beta uprising in my high school a decade ago when the school forced incels to go to prom. A group of boys, about 10, were unable to get dates, so they refused to go to prom because it was embarassing to go without a date. They decided to organise their own night out at a burger and shakes joint. word reached the school master and since 10 guys not attending prom was a huge drop in attendance, he ordered a circular to ""combat anti-social behaviour"" and ordered that anyone who refused to attend prom without a valid excuse would have to go to detention since the prom was ""part of school hours"". The group of boys organised a sit in strike in protest, led by a polynesian shortcel, but they eventually lost and were forced to go to prom AND attend detention for organising the strike."

it is actually obligatory in some schools and not attending can give you several periods of detention. It all depends on how many guys refuse to go. In my school, a lot of guys couldn't get a date because of the 80/20 rule so they refused to go. Since it was a lot of guys refusing to go, the prom would have an embrassing low attendance so the school made it compulsory."

Bathrooms with tilted mirrors? Can't see myself.

Small car? Have to tilt my head because it pushes against the ceiling.

Lecture hall? Have to sit diagonally because I literally don't fucking fit.

Stairs? Awkward steps where going one at a time is uncomfortable but also going 2 at a time feels like I'm lunging.

Clothes that are the right length but aren't made for a 600lb person's width? Go fuck yourself those don't exist, wear this tarp instead.

Low hanging objects? Fuck you now you gotta duck all the damn time.

Trying to sneak around? Fuck you, you can't hide behind anything.

Something heavy needs to be carried? You get asked to move it 99% of the time.

Someone needs to be walked home? Well since you're a tallfuck that automatically makes you everyone's bodyguard apparently.

Hightop shoes that sit on your ankle nicely? Go  fuck yourself.

Water fountains? Prepare to crouch in the most awkward way possible.

Giving a short person a hug? Now you gotta somehow hug them properly but also kinda crouch not really.

Fuck low ceilings.

Wanna be a fighter pilot? No tallfucks allowed.

Wanna get drunk? Hope you can afford being broke.

Wanna walk around at night? Everyone is suspicious of you because you look scary.

Wanna ride the kid's rides at a themepark? Fuck you, too tall, go ride the adult rides like a pedestrian.

Fuck headrests

Fuck office chairs with a 150lb weight limit

Trying to fall asleep? Your foot always hangs off the enr of the bed so now the monsters are gonna get you

Want a neat colored putter when you play mini golf? Fuck you, you gotta have the adult size ones that are always matte black and still too short.

Everyone wants to steal your goddamn hoodies because they're literally just tarps with sleeves.

You always gotta stand in the back of group pictures/crowds.

Next time he’s bullying you just walk up to him and throw your first into his nose as hard as you can, and before he has time to know what’s happened, kick him in the balls.   Just land that first punch, practice first, then stand up for yourself.  That’s what my dad taught me, and it worked.  My father made me fight my bully, and as scared as I was, I still landed some punches, and he stopped fucking with me just because I stood up for myself.  There was no need to beat him to a pulp, just sticking up for myself was enough.  Why not try that before doing something extreme?"

2685,bernie-cancer,"Hey, everyone! Did you know I’m tall?! Like, I’m taller than this other guy! Isn’t that crazy? I’m, like, tall! In fact, there are people who I don’t like that are shorter than me, a tall man. I am tall, you see. I’m just taller than other people. Did I mention I’m tall? You care, right? Isn’t it just so fucking amazing how I, a tall person, is also taller than other people, who are shorter than me? Like, bro, I’m tall. This also means that I could beat people up, as a tall person. You see, I’m tall (just saying; not bragging) so I could probably (definitely) physically dominate people I do not like who are shorter than me. I’ve actually been considering posting the exact measurements of my body, because this is just insane. Don’t you guys think it’s just absolutely fucking surreal that some people (like me) are taller than others (like people I do not like, or want to condescend to)? I’m just tall. I’m actually thinking of writing a book to just articulate the jaw-dropping, invigorating extent to which I am, in actuality, taller than many other people. I know no one really asked, and none of you know me, but I just wanted to let you all know. You don’t even need to see my face or verify the claim that I’m tall. You don’t even need to believe me. But I’m just typing this to let you know that I am tall. Will you gain anything from this knowledge? Probably not, but, the thing is, I think it’s just necessary to tell people, even complete strangers who are, quite frankly, already aware that tall people (like me) exist, and honestly aren’t stimulated or empowered upon learning of my tallness, which I am espousing the specifics of, as a tall person who is taller than people who are not tall. I forgot to mention that, when I was 14, I was also tall, and I was also tall when I was every age after that, such as the ages 15, 16, 17, 18 etc. Isn’t that bizarre? I, a tall person, was even tall in other moments which precede the current moment. When I was 16, people said to me “you’re tall”, and I was aware of such a fact (that I am tall). One thing that utterly astonished me is the fact that I was taller than people who were 17 when I was 16! Like, WHAT? I was taller than people who were older than me. Doesn’t that violate the laws of biology and physics? Incredible. I just wanted to let you know. Just kind of casually, you know? Like, there are even tall people who are shorter than me — this is because I am so far over the line of division between tallness and shortness that there is no universe possible in which I could be conceivably seen as short (a prospect which I truly fear, as I am tall). So, basically, I was just dropping by to let you guys know that I’m tall, which is the opposite of short, and short isn’t tall, which is something I am, as a person who is tall and not short. So, yeah."

It DOES NOT matter what your conditions are, your weight is controllable. It's how much energy you burn versus how much you take in. It's the first law of thermodynamics playing out in a biological system. If you put more energy in than you're putting out, your body stores the excess as fat. If you aren't, your body burns fat to make up the difference. If it's equal, your body reaches homeostasis.

Weight gain is ALWAYS Energy In vs. Energy Out.

3004,topkekcel,"Low IQ. 

People aren't shitting on her because she shits on short guys (although she might, we don't know). People shit on her for complaining so much about a **self-inflicted, solvable** problem so much that she literally got an article written about it.

If every guy (particularly short ones) had an article whining about all the times they were insulted throughout life, the internet would have fucking crashed by now. It would literally drown out everything else. It'd overtake porn as the largest content on the web.

She (and her article) also serve as a proxy for the ongoing tenet of this sub that one of the major failings of society is how it's ""wrong"" to shame/joke about fat people  (mostly just the women though) even though it's a controllable characteristic, and how shaming/joking about short guys is often just a punchline. There will be HOARDS of people defending her online and in the comments of her article going on and on about blahblahblah ""beauty comes in all sizes"", ""pAtRiArChY"", ""they're just insecure about themselves"" etc. etc.

You know the response a short guy would get if he wrote an article about ""People at my school think it's okay to call me short to my face""?

""Who hurt you"" ""Awww poor lil guy haha"" ""Napoleon complex LMFAO"" ""Bet he has a small dick too hehe XD""

It IS our fucking business because articles like this, and the response they get, provide insight into the values and priorities of a society that marginalizes and abuses us, that shits on us for things completely out of our control, while at the same time having the audacity to try and claim that society really isn't doing anything and it's all in our heads."

Deployment military is a totally different beast, garrison is literally a business 😒. 

If push came to shove though I think the Boomers would be surprised to know Generation Zoomer is actually pretty bloodthirsty for deployments, war and glory.

If you think Saudi Arabia is our ally, you're delusional. If anyone is our biggest enemy, it's them. Who do you think funds all the terrorist activities, not Iran. These fuckers would love nothing more than to kill us all, if they weren't making so much money by doing business with us. Money is our only alliance with them, nothing else.

Not to mention the rest of Europe’s thousands of years of history of constant warfare. Yet Europe was able to be fixed (mostly).

WW1 and WW2 happened within the last 100 years. Remind me when the Crusades against the middle east were again? And unlike Europe, they didn't fight to be part of the 20th and 21st centuries, and understood when they were beaten, and when they need to start acting accordingly with the rest of the world."

> Publicly displayed, sexualized depictions of women have proliferated, enabled by new communication technologies, including the internet and mobile devices. These depictions are often claimed to be outcomes of a culture of gender inequality and female oppression, but, paradoxically, recent rises in sexualization are most notable in societies that have made strong progress toward gender parity. Few empirical tests of the relation between gender inequality and sexualization exist, and there are even fewer tests of alternative hypotheses. We examined aggregate patterns in 68,562 sexualized self-portrait photographs (“sexy selfies”) shared publicly on Twitter and Instagram and their association with city-, county-, and cross-national indicators of gender inequality. We then investigated the association between sexy-selfie prevalence and income inequality, positing that sexualization—a marker of high female competition—is greater in environments in which incomes are unequal and people are preoccupied with relative social standing. Among 5,567 US cities and 1,622 US counties, areas with relatively more sexy selfies were more economically unequal but not more gender oppressive. A complementary pattern emerged cross-nationally (113 nations): Income inequality positively covaried with sexy-selfie prevalence, particularly within more developed nations. To externally validate our findings, we investigated and confirmed that economically unequal (but not gender-oppressive) areas in the United States also had greater aggregate sales in goods and services related to female physical appearance enhancement (beauty salons and women’s clothing). Here, we provide an empirical understanding of what female sexualization reflects in societies and why it proliferates."
3280,Subhrangshu26,"These soy cucks will say that women are not a commodity,well guess what billionaire/millionaire's hard earned money or inherited wealth isn't a commodity either for these cucks and fags to loot for free. What 
gives these cucks the right to determine what is a commodity or not"
3281,ALIENS_SHOT_JFK,">Every aspect of dating inequality has a parallel in financial/economic inequality.

>However, in March 2015, the website *Medium* published a statistical analysis quantifying the degrees of inequality on Tinder as a dating market. The analysis concluded that 'the bottom 80% of men (in terms of attractiveness) are competing for the bottom 22% of women and the top 78% of women are competing for the top 20% of men. ***The Gini coefficient for the Tinder dating market based on 'like' percentages was calculated to be 0.58. This means that the Tinder economy has more inequality than 95.1% of all the world's national economies.*** In addition, it was determined that a man of average attractiveness would be 'liked' by approximately .87% (1 in 115) of women on Tinder.

This was 5 years ago. Imagine how bad it is now."

I would also like to add that this frustration with people is entirely normal. We like to favorably compare ourselves to others.  It's our default state. I think [This Is Water](https://youtu.be/8CrOL-ydFMI) captures the nature of our frustration and superiority nicely.

I don't think your comment accurately describes me or that the inverse accurately describes men.  However, prejudice and generalizations are based in our primitive reptile brain. They are the most basic ways to relate to others ever.  

We also know convincing rhetoric takes practice. It's easy just to call others stupid.  We even have evidence to suggest that people with below average intelligence are the most likely to think everyone else is stupid. Anyone familiar is supicious of people's self-declarations of intellectual superiority.

No one talks about her due to the eons of suppression females have faced through time. There are many more like her, females are really the same as men when it comes to brain chemistry, there isn't much of a difference. We are all subject to the same vices and troubles. We are all human, the sooner you come to realize that the sooner you can get on with your life."

I just want a good well paying job, a wife that loves me everyday after work, a nice house that I own for myself, a few kids that love their father and perhaps even a pet like a dog or a cat.

But too bad my job pays like shit, I am in no romantic relationship, I live in a shitty apartment with expensive rent, no children of my own and I am allergic to pets at an age where I expected to have all of the above.

To be honest, I blame this gynocentric society and neoliberals for this shit. They corrupted women by taking advantage of their nature and by putting them on the pedestal. While we men are expected to work a 50 hour work week in exchange for the minimum wage that barely pays rent. They want to turn a mammalian tribal society into an bug colony so that rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer, a strong family will easily counter this change of society.

Big corporations, the destruction of the nuclear family, Tinder, minimum wage jobs, greedy landlords, pornography, simps, cucks, neoliberals and feminists all ruined this for us."

Like boomers he would probably take her dependence as proof that she truly desires him sexually but the proof is in the pudding: we live in the most sexually liberated culture that has ever existed and in this free market nobody is coming to buy what he's selling. The absolute worst you can say about modern dating culture is that it allows people to pursue their actual desires. It's pure cope to believe that big corporations are the reason women don't want to fuck you.
