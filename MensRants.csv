1,arkindal,"Beside, I might be wrong because English isn't my first language but doesn't the word men works for a group composed by both, all males and a mix of males and females?"
2,BalllsackTBaghard,I think there was one woman or maybe not.
3,ARedditorCalledQuest,DAE think womn are grate? (I'll take my karma now...)
4,newmobsforall,"Only in one very particular sense, and that is if you are talking about all of humankind as in ""All men are created equal"". If it's any more specific than that, then it just applies to males. ""All men are created equal"" means everybody; ""All men in New Jersey are created equal"" means just the dudes."
5,,"It can, yes."
6,arkindal,"Oh ok, got it, thanks man."
7,arkindal,So even if the group actually had a woman there was no reason for that comment in the first place. There you go.
8,Trolly-McTroll,How is this hypocrisy??? She said *my* body my choice. This only applies to the poor helpless benevolent womenfolk. 
9,DJWhamo,"To be fair: My parents had me circumcised back during a time when it was widely believed there were health benefits to the practice. Now, since then I believe this has been proven to not be the case, but considering that mentality, you may as well be making an argument against childhood vaccinations."
10,Le-Squirtle,"There are a few medical benefits to male circumcision. Whether it weighs against the decision being made for someone who can say. Studies have also suggested that women by large prefer the look a circumcised penis, again I am not citing validity.

* So in a sense a mother may think they are making the right choice.
* Unfortunately this procedure is much easier/safer when younger.
* This decision is often split between BOTH parents not just the mother.

Just a few points I thought relevant. "
11,mycophycophyta,How have vaccinations been scientifically proven to not be necessary?
12,DJWhamo,"I'm not suggesting that was ever the case. I'm simply saying that, back in the day at least, the motivation behind getting a child circumcised was similar to the motivation behind getting them vaccinations. Therefore, to call someone out for simply being concerned for their child's health.."
13,mycophycophyta,"I'd agree. I was circumcised for the very reason. I misread your comment. I'm assuming that this meme was made depicting a person from recently (a time when circumcision is unnecessary, at least in the first world)."
14,ARedditorCalledQuest,That's always been my take on that particular meme. I've only really seen it applied to 21st century issues.
15,ExpendableOne,that plus the trying to get women into computer science fields that no women really want to get into in the first place because they don't like nerdy men or nerdy fields.

28,mensrightsthrowaway1,"Was she being dismissive? It looks like she might have been being genuine. Usually people who bother to be political on Facebook confuses me, but I thing you gave a really, really good reply to that question. You came across as reasonable and educated on the topic while still getting across the point that your penis isn't oppressing anyone. The men's rights movement really benefits from people like you.

P.S. the reason feminists usually adopt poor old Cecilia as a symbol of ""male oppression"" is that she was told by a couple of scientists that her conclusions were wrong. But that probably was more because she was challanging a widely held belief, rather than because of her vagina. She was a brilliant scientist, probably at the same level as some of the ones in your post. Emmy Noether trumps everyone, I wish more people knew about her."

53,Capitalsman,"It was the longbowmen in the battle ganging up on knights in hand to hand combat going against the ""a knight for a knight"" part of the code. Muskets removed the need to be trained in melee fighting like knights so they just weilded muskets and 9 foot pikes basically, so no knights on the field of battle washes away the code of chivalry."

62,Deansdale,"Well, assuming the business world is rational about/towards its own profit, and assuming this 77% stat is anywhere near accurate (this being a very brave assumption I admit) then it follows that women on average do 77% of the work men on average do. It is only rational to think so, because if women would do the same work for less money, companies would hire more women to take advantage of this fact. If women would do even less work, they would get even less in wages.

But of course this whole idea is utter nonsense because feminists arrived at this 77% ""stat"" comparing the sum of all wages earned by all men and all women nationwide. Which is meaningless, considering it compares the wages of CEOs to that of cleaning ladies, loggers in alaska to teacher's aides in San Diego, etc. Considering that men suffer 20 times more workplace accidents and deaths, work more overtime, accept longer commutes, etc. etc. it is a small wonder that they **only** get about 25% more in wages."

what i actually mean, women do less work hours on average than men. So less working hours = less profit compared to other business.
We already see special condition for women business and in my country politicians want to add some kind of quota system to business so higher % is run by women and obviously favors women.

The more mras and feminists fight, the less anything gets accomplished. If all we do is shit on feminism as a whole based on, in this case what sounds like domestic abuse, we push reasonable feminists further into the extremist camp which is counterproductive. Your garden variety feminist/mra just believes they have issues affecting their gender that need to be addressed, which is true in either case.

Well said. Dissenting opinions are best presented with hyperbole and vitriol. But seriously, can you prove that our leaders *aren't* secretly reptiles? I've actually met a member of the reptilian elite (her words, not mine, I think they're kind of racist) and she was pretty evasive when I asked her about her people's involvement in national and global politics. She did mention something about trying to foster global warming because the temperatures would better suit a cold blooded lifestyle if they could heat the planet up. Us endothermic types would probably be screwed though. Oh! Hey! Maybe if they pull it off, there's a way to convert our bodies over to an exothermic system so we could enjoy the weather too! I don't know if the tech is there yet though. Maybe we'll just have to stay inside and pay extortionate rates for air conditioning while those- goddamnit that's the real scheme, isn't it? They're coming for our planet! They're going to raise the rates for electricity after they make it so hot that only they can stand it outside and suck us dry! #killalllizards

135,,"Pick your source, women have been over represented in higher-education for 25+ years. Nobody cares. Why? It doesn't benefit women, it doesn't address a concern of women, it can't be used to further empower feminism.

Enrollment first reaches parity in 1988 with 30.2% of all men and 30.4% of all women 18-24 years old pursuing higher education. It had varied within 4 points of parity since 1975[29%(M) and 23.7%(F)]. Between 1988 and 2012 the difference has only grown in favor of women. In 2012 it was 37.6%(M) and 44.5%(F). This disparity has been over 5 points in difference every year since 2000. 

We've had 15 years of a gender disparity that in 1976, when it disadvantaged women, was a major rallying point for feminism, gender rights and equality. Some how it doesn't spark the same reaction today when it disadvantages men.
http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_302.60.asp

Enrollment for everyone from 1980-2009. Students by gender ranges from 42% in 1980 to 45% in 2008 for men and 57% to 55% for women.
http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0278.pdf

This one starts with a slight female majority(52%) in 1980 and goes up to 56% in 2009.
http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0281.pdf

This is just enrollment, not who finishes with a degree or who goes on to get a higher degree which are:

Associate Degree:2000-60.3%(F)/39.7%(M), 2010-62.0%(F)/38%(M)

Bachelors Degree:2000-57.5%(F)/42.5%(M), 2010-57.4%(F)/42.6%(M)

Masters Degree:2000-60.0%(F)/40%(M), 2010-62.6%(F)/37.4%(M)

Nor does this reveal academic performance in primary and secondary schools which shows a clear bias toward girls who consistently outperform boys in all subjects save math and physics and have done so since the 1970's. While the math and physics results are only slightly higher for boys, reading skills are especially marked with an enormous bias in favor of girls.

Since there is little effort to address these issues, they clearly mean less to feminism and other groups than whatever they're currently putting their effort into. Like rape culture, not enough female CEOs, a fake Pay gap, and not enough women in STEM. All of those are more important issues than boys attending and performing in school at rates like those of women in the fucking 70s when education reform was a main focus of those same organizations that now ignore it.

Men who fail to register could face up to five years in jail, a fine up to $250,000, denial of participation in various federal programs and benefits, including student loans (such as FAFSA), job training and federal employment. **You must register to vote.**

Selective Service law as it is written now refers specifically to ""male persons"" in stating who must register and who would be drafted. For women to be required to register with the Selective Service, Congress would have to amend the law, which currently **exempts women** from registration.

Let me explain, getting people to die for a cause is something the elite does to the poor.  The educated are the generals while the poor are the foot soldiers.


I am sure if they could have got women to go into battle over land or some other crap they would have done so but tradition outweighed the appetite of women on the battlefield."

Voting rights? Historically you were a felon and thus lost voting rights as all felons do.  They don't currently prosecute, but you do lose access to federal loans and grants, as well as the ability to eventually work for the gov't.
"
170,Bartab,"> For women to be required to register with the Selective Service, Congress would have to amend the law, which currently exempts women from registration.


Yes and no.  The current law has been tested in court and found to pass constitutional muster *only because* women were not allowed in combat positions.  They de facto are allowed now, and by 2016 it will be official.  Such a change is significant enough for another court case."
171,,"After a quick glance at wikipedia, the selective service act was created in 1917.   Thats almost 100 years ago.  Women didn't have a constitutional right to vote and WW1 was still raging on.  So why were women not included?  Because the men didn't want them to go.  Hell, I wouldn't want my wife to go, or my son to go to war.


I think the only thing that would make selective service conscionable is if it took a popular vote for the draft.  The draft was perverted when it came to the vietnam war because that fight was purely political.   There was no clear and present danger to the United States.

>While I agree with /u/TiberiusDanger[1]  about war being something the elite does to the poor, who exactly are elite and poor here?

The elite, in this case, are the politicians and those who influence them.  The poor are those who lack influence.  With the draft, there were ways to get around it.  

1.  You have to be enrolled in college.
2.  Get a medical exemption
3.  Have a connection to get into the air national guard.

But, this is rants so: 4. Be born female.

Men certainly had a hand in crafting this ultimate degree of benevolent sexism and the elite do pull the strings. This has more to do with society and cultural practices than feminism.

But when 51% of the population, enough for a simple majority, can vote without promising *anything* for the ""right"", and the 49% must promise *everything*, it hardly seems just."

234,,"I am unsure about the *logic* of this woman. Surely, had he not gone to prison and had she divorced him anyway he would never have been *given* the four million dollars? She divorced a poor *convict* not a free man. By any sane logic she would only be entitled to half of whatever money the prison gave him during the time he was married to her while incarcerated. That and half of whatever else he owned at the time.  
I know The Law is insane at times, with people being jailed for accepting bribes the briber is acquitted of tendering and other oddities but I'm not sure I can see any basis for her claim.  
The convict did not earn the money *while in the marriage*. It is proceeds of a gift given to him *after the marriage was dissolved* when she had no legal connection to him.  
So far as I understand it, **I** would have as much claim to his compensation as she did. I am equally a stranger to him. 
But, I am not a USAlien lawyer and I would very much like to know exactly how wrong I am.

237,,"Do you mean to ask ""Why does 'John' not offer to go to prison to act as a sacrifice in lieu of the many millions of mass, serial rapists who are 'getting away with it'?""? If so, the answer is simple: elderly priests.  
If they truly, truly believed that their after-life would be such a great and wonderful place, every single entry class in every seminary worldwide throughout all of History would have been a blood-bath as every priest cajoled every one of their fellows to murder him that each and all would reach their reward that little bit faster.  
There would be no *followers* wearing bomb-vests only the very highest of the hierarchy of the priesthoods. There would be no Crusaders dying in hordes before the priests rushed to do so.  
""John"", in truth, does not believe his own words. He is a hypocrite and a liar. Like the priests he is unwilling to sacrifice his own liberty, life, treasure and comforts to the cause he espouses while being very willing to throw others into the fires.  
He is the one who votes for he death penalty, for harsh treatment of prisoners, for jail without trials of anyone accused of a heinous crime - after all the police would never arrest without good cause,would they? He supports all of these until it is his very own precious self being taken away to face the noose. Then, suddenly, clemency seems like a fucking brilliant idea.   
But, naturally, only for the *innocent*. Or those who *didn't mean it*.  
In short, 'John' is a wanker.

Feminism is a highly abstract theoretical discipline with an ocean of literature, plenty of reference to social science, history, and biology. Am I supposed to believe that a 9 year old girl indulged in all that, did good research, and came to a good conclusion?

No, of course not. She's indoctrinated from  a young age to be a radical. 

And of course it's not nearly enough for her to simply say she's a feminist, be happy with her dogma, and be done. She has to try to target 9 year old boys into buying her dogma because it's the one holy truth. The one holy truth of how to properly describe society, shape your morals, and analyze data.

Yes, ""The Suffrage Movement"". That thing where there was one movement, it was nice and cohesive where everyone wanted the same thing, and they unified for that purpose into a movement to accomplish their goals. 

> That captivated Shaye's interest and she poured her energy into writing what she thought would be the best oral she'd ever written, maybe an oral that would take her to the gym – possibly even the city finals.

What? A nine year old who was undoubtedly getting told she was the strongest little princess in reality by her dogmatic parents (who's appraisal of her work was certainly not influenced by the fact that they gave her those beliefs) had unrealistically high expectations? Well shit, that never happens. Such oppression.

> But, when her teacher, Mike Chudoba, gave it back to her with his notes, Shaye was disappointed to learn she would have to remove a paragraph that talked about rape statistics and Ontario's proposed sex education curriculum from it before she could present it to her class.

Ahh, I can just tell that this was a level headed presentation and not a radical rant presented to 9 year olds.

> One out of five women and girls will be raped or assaulted by a man, and less than 1% of rapists are held accountable by a court of law. It was not until this year, 2015, that Ontario's curriculum began teaching kids like me the concept of consent, which is the right to say no.

Yep, level headed, researched, and well presented. 

No wait, they didn't even get the definition of consent right...

> But she and her mom believe it's important that kids her age understand they have a right to say 'no' to adults and other kids, and that their bodies are their own.  

Most people already know this... although I still have no idea what 9 year olds are going to consent to. 

> “She asked me if anyone had ever changed the world with a speech,” said Ambeault.

Holy unrealistic expectations batman!

> “He told me it's the first time he's ever had to deal with a student writing an oral on a subject too advanced for them,” said Shaye.

Oh for fuck's sake, the principal was being nice. She's not ""too advanced."" She's completely inappropriate. God dammit. I hate this shit so much.

> “More people are going to hear about this through here than would even if I went to zone finals with it,” she said.

Gosh you're nobel. Seriously though, we've all heard these tired statistics being thrown around. Citing them for the hundredth time won't do anything.

> “It could be like that pond thing, you know, with the ripples going out,” she said.

Yes, you and you're daughter a the cause of rape awareness. You are the center of the ripple, that's exactly what this is. For fuck's sake, these people are idiots."

292,amishbreakfast,"Originally, MADD (mothers against drunk driving) made their cause about lobbying to make the penalties for drunk driving harsher and to increase the awareness of the dangers of drunk driving.  A pretty worthwhile cause, I'd say.  And they won.

But when they got their way, when their goals were achieved, they didn't pat themselves on the back for a job well done and go home.  They had a large donation receiving network, they had political connections, and they were a publicly visible and respected group.  So they just re-purposed themselves and used those tools to take on new causes unrelated to driving intoxicated.  Like motorcycle helmet and seat-belt laws or redefining ""intoxicated"" to mean drinking one can of beer within an hour of getting in a car.  Now MADD aren't brave heroes; they're intrusive busy-bodies.

Basically, I think the same thing has happened to feminism.

295,masonmason22,[Here's the thread that made me bring this up](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/19wu10/today_is_international_womens_day_the_oppression/). 
296,IceRollMenu2,"I haven't read the book, but some interview with the author, and it seems her idea is that you can't be wholly against unnecessary oppression if you are a feminist but also eat meat. Basically she's calling out what she considers hypocrisy.

I mean, there are definitely some relations between gender stereotypes and meat eating. Consider [the german meat cooking magazine called [beef](http://www.beef.de), which has as it's catch phrase: ""für männer mit geschmack""-> ""for men with good taste"". Or take Adam Richman's [""man vs food""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_v._Food), in which ""man"" is pretty obviously not meant to mean ""human"", but male. This relation of manliness to meat eating is just a part of our culture, and if you think there's something wrong with traditional gender stereotypes, this might be something you can critisize.

Personally, I would not think it to be reasonable as a first priority from a feminist standpoint. After all, there are many other things men are expected to do more than women, e.g. drive cars, drink, enjoy sports, etc. I think this is where you need the premiss that meat eating is particularly harmful, more so than e.g. sports. But all in all, I can see what the connection is between feminism and veganism."
297,masonmason22,"And through that they try to swell their numbers. I always come across feminists saying ""If you want racial equality, then you need to be a feminist."" Now they're saying ""If you want to end animal exploitation, you need to be a feminist."" It is just frustrating. "
298,Deansdale,These are seriously idiots. No doubt about it.
299,masonmason22,"You make some very good points.

I just don't like the way they blame it on patriarchy theory, which then blames it on men. Women just as much as men reinforce gender stereotypes and feminism and all of it's patriarchy theory isn't needed in the fight against those. "
300,,"> relation of manliness to meat eating is just part of our culture

Well, McGill researchers have found that [seeing meat calms men down](http://www.mcgill.ca/aoc/news/channels/2010/november/1/caveman-behavioural-traits-might-kick-dinner-table-eating), and it's not a localized cultural phenomenon.

inb4 biotruth"
301,IceRollMenu2,"As far as I understand, the argument goes the other way around: The author is saying that if you want to be a true feminist, you need to be against animal exploitation. In a way it's the opposite of what you accuse her of."
302,IceRollMenu2,"I think patriarchy is an important concept in feminism. As far as I have heard the concept used, it's not meant to mean ""men"" in general. You can be opposed to patriarchy as a man, and there are women who support patriarchy. I think this is why a feminist can agree with you that some women reinforce gender stereotypes just as badly as some men do. Patriarchy is just supposed to be a system of power relations in which men are generally favored, no matter who supports or fights that.

EDIT: Why downvote this? I was not trying to piss anyone off...?"
303,masonmason22,"Is patriarchy a system that still exists? I was under the impression that as an institutionalised system, it had disappeared (eg: women don't need father's permission to marry, etc). "
304,amishbreakfast,">women don't need father's permission to marry

This one always confused me.  Boys were placed into arranged marriages too.  Somehow when it happens to a girl then she is victimized, but when it happens to a boy then he is a co-victimizer."
305,IceRollMenu2,"I think these are actually two questions: (1) Are there places where patriarchy is still institutionalised and (2) Should only the institutionalised versions of patriarchy be politically relevant. I think (1) is easily answerable, as there are still many parts where patriarchy is directly institutionalised (e.g. women not being allowed to drive cars). But how much of patriarchy is institutionalised in the west depends a bit on what ""institutionalised"" is taken to mean: Some states' unwillingness to provide for day-care centers and other failings to make child-rearing and work compatible mostly favor women to stay at home and be dependent on their partner. Another thing would be the ban on abortions in some regions, as it restricts women's authority over their own bodies. I think things like these could be seen as ""institutionalised patriarchy"". But (2) is crucial as well, because political agendas can include things that do not aim at legal change, but at social change. Patriarchy would probably also include women being harrassed at work, or being misrepresented in the media (ever heard of the [Bechdel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test)?) So from a feminist standpoint, not just changing a state's institutions matters, but also making relations between genders more equal in general."
306,TheMortalOne,"I thought that was just another case of 
""patriarchy hurt men too"".

Despite the fact that often it it was the mothers (or female matchmakers, like in fiddler on the roof) that arranged the marriage. "

Apparently a lot of women just turn into total nightmares around Valentine's day for reasons they can't even adequately explain to themselves. Something about being told their entire lives that the validity of their relationships, which in turn represents their validity as women, is reflected in how ""perfect"" Valentine's Day is. Which means everyone she dates has to do it better than the last person. Add a bunch of letdowns over the course of ten or fifteen years and that's a lot of making up to do. "

I remember being a kid, and my friend telling me that I should just save up money for Christmas, so I can give gifts to everyone. They all got upset when I had nothing for them. It was bullshit, because all through the year I was always buying them little things I thought they would like.

Not to mention how it must be for those who are unattached and not happy about that fact. They are force-fed a blitzkrieg of ads showing them how happy everyone else seems to be, since this is a holiday for lovers, something they are not a part of.

Oh, and don't get me started on how the entire ""holiday"" screams money=love. Love someone? Prove it by spending money on them.
