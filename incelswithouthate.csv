Incel wasn't a popular (compared to now) term for my teen/college years, but my boyfriend says he definitely would have identified with the community if it existed before he met me. I was attracted initially to his sense of humor and obvious intelligence, and we've been together happily for 11 years as of August.

142,Saddam420,"Not a bad effort. Most of this reduces to things that have been posted by normies on incel communities many times before, but I do like that you were so honest here:

>Meeting people is just a matter of odds.

The IT will hate this truth the most, because it destroys their ability to weaponize accusations of ""bad personality."" In fact, if they were able to grasp this and follow it to its conclusion, they would apologize to us and shut down their sub immediately. (If you start getting racist private messages from sock puppet accounts, it's from IT users.)

Also some advice for your advice: Don't make the 'ball rolling' part so dependent on alcohol because many here are on psychiatric medications that interact severely with alcohol, and inviting someone to go drink alcohol and then proceeding to not drink alcohol yourself is potentially problematic in many ways."
143,,">**You don't go fishing to catch fish**,

I can get behind this however,

&#x200B;

> **don't talk to people only because you want something from them**. 

People have agendas, wants and needs. It's just part of human behaviour (selfishness, cynicism). And some people just are not that sociable to get pleasure out of talking to people and being friendly for it's own sake. So you're saying don't talk to people because you have some kind of intention (like to build up your social network, meet more women and that kind of thing) but realistically you can't quash the desire. It's going to be there.

&#x200B;

>**Don't try to impress people**. 

Again, this isn't something that necessarily works in a superficial society. People form first impressions about people all the time based on how you walk and talk, how you present yourself, what kind of job you have. People who are purely superficial are just as rare as people who purely judge others based only on what's inside. Most people are somewhere inbetween those two extremes, so realistically you need to have a blendure of traits that will appeal to both personality types. You talk about ""things that worked for me"" but realistically, you are probably neglecting to talk about ***other*** things that might have worked for you like going to the gym, focussing on your career, focussing on the way you walk, talk and present yourself, improving your looks and style, those kinds of more materialistic qualities.

&#x200B;

>**Meeting people is just a matter of odds** 

Luck plays a role but it is by no means the only important factor. People tend to form cliques and put up social barriers against lone wolves, introverts, shy types and folks with mental health issues or physical defects. That is a barrier that has to be overcome and it is not purely accomplished by going out more which can help but is also a double edged sword (more on this).

&#x200B;

>**""Hey, wanna grab a beer this week?""** 

I understand this has to be contextualised, e.g. in a conversation where you have already built rapport with someone. But if we take this at face value alone, it's not really a suggestion that brings much value. My one is ""would you like to get a coffee some time"" but I use it mostly because I can't think of anything better. I mean there is a world of interesting and fun activities like tennis, salsa, restaurants, theatres and so on. Is getting a drink really the only suggestion you can make to someone? How are you going to make your invitation sound appealing? This person is going to spend time with you so they want to know they will get value rather than just having value leeched off them. How are you going to build up to this kind of invitation? What ways can you be innovative and sound interesting? Just asking people out to drinks is something that more often than not will get a ""sorry but I'm busy this week, maybe some other time though"" type of response. Like I said, I use it but I don't think it should be presented as the optimal strategy at all.

&#x200B;

>*Take yourself on dates*

This is something that is a double edged sword.  Doing this you can build up a foundation for engaging in interesting activities and being an interesting person but you can also be seen as ""that guy"" who's always by himself when you go to these places where hopefully you will also be interested in building up a basis for networking.

&#x200B;

>Being a well-rounded human being is crucial to a good conversation. TV and video games give you very little to talk about. 

Ok, yes I can't disagree with this one. But being good at conversation requires more than just having a wide array of interests. You will need to be good at wit which requires abstract logic. You will need other psychological skills that involve shifting conversations towards subjects you are good at discussing, introducing fascinating anecdotes and in general just being good at improvisation. So having interests is definitely one component of being a good conversationalist but it undermines what actually goes into the art as a whole.

&#x200B;

>It's fine to ask for a glass of water, to say ""dude, that was mean"" or ""please stop interrupting me"". 

Sure but people who do this can also have difficulties socialising. In fact it can come across as an anal, highly  strung-out personality type if you do it all the time. Which is often what happens when guys listen to too much PUA and self-improvement related stuff.

&#x200B;

>*No More Mr Nice Guy*. Every incel should read this book. It really helped me spin things around and realize *I* was being manipulative. 

This is something that makes me sad to hear. Guys can have be non-manipulative and have genuinely good traits but suffer socially and with women regardless. Talking about and complaining of issues you have ***in spite of*** genuinely good traits is something that is often mischaracterised as something that must be non-assertive as well as manipulative which is totally not necessarily the case at all. The *No More Mr Nice Guy* book began a very bad stereotype about ""nice guys"" as manipulative, validation seeking and non-assertive which wasn't fair at all. And it is often recommended as a ""go to resource"" now for men who struggle with women, socialising or other areas in life, where the assumption tends to be that if you struggle in these areas you must be manipulative, validation seeking and non-assertive. Very unhelpful.

&#x200B;

> *How to win friends and influence people*. It's just a great manual on how to deal with other human beings 

I'm sorry but it is not. It is a great manual on how to be a socially subservient ""Yes Man"". In the book Carnegie literally recommends never criticising people or only indirectly so, which does not account for situations where a person may be engaging in destructive behaviour that is potentially dangerous. This is just an example. He also says ""never argue"" or try to prove your right which again doesn't account for many nuanced situations where you may well need to demonstrate correctness if another person is going to engage in potentially foolish behaviour that may harm himself, others or you. There are more instances of passive behaviour and cheesy/forced positivity stuff that really is not particularly helpful at all in that book.

&#x200B;

>*The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F\*\*k*. Optional read. The first chapter (which is free) should be enough. It gets repetitive after that.

I haven't read it. But life requires that people ""give a fuck"".

&#x200B;

My friend's gf once told me she gravitates toward me in social situations bc I make her feel safe (weird thing to say but still cool). I have a really wide set of interests which allow me to go talk Russian history with the nerds in my office, interpersonal drama with the old ladies, share stories with the sales people, and business with the managers.

This is the best list of advice for incels I've ever seen, and I agree with every point on here. Not sure if you've already come across this, but I would focus on trying to emmulate this as much as possible. Basically, stop living in your own head thinking it's impossible to make connections, and focus on being happy with yourself first and foremost. Once you accomplish that, the rest will literally fall into place without much effort. Making lasting connections, platonicaly and romantically, starts with you building love for yourself. Without that, you will continue to fail. "

171,Hugh_Surname,"Trying to keep all this stuff in your head all the time is a surefire way to overthink everything and engage in excessive self-blame. What I found is that I naturally started acting the way this post recommends after getting my first girlfriend. Simply the experience of regularly having sex with someone and spending time with them caused me to be more internally validated, less outcome dependent, more engaged with life, etc.

&#x200B;

So just try to fake all of this stuff the best you can until you can get a gf (who doesn't have to be attractive, or have much in common with you, but should be kind). This is one of those things where sex/a girlfriend really is the solution, at least IME."
172,MaXxUser," **You don't go fishing to catch fish** 

 **Be interesting** 

As a gay dude, who had far to many girls interested in him before he came out of the closet, 3 factors that were huge

I was busy - I had a fucking life, I didn't have time for girls, and that makes you, and your time more valuable. And this isnt a ""fake being busy thing"", this was a I was living my life, doing my best to do things that made me happy.

I wasn't interested - I wanted to do things with people because I wanted to do those things, play Catan, go swimming, go for a road trip, go to an amusement park, and I would always go as a group, and there would always be some girl trying to get my attention

I was happy - One of the most attractive quality's in someone, is that they are happy without you, they dont need you, they are living their best life

&#x200B;

Stop thinking about women, stop trying to chase them, do shit that makes you happy, and I mean genuinely happy, not I played 13 hours of video games happy. Find a ""stretch"" activity aka something outside of your comfort zone and do it. You all know something you want to do, (gym? A party or event? A road trip? A vacation? School? A course? A therapist?) just get started, even if that means its just finding the details out of how to begin."

I'm 'guilty as charged' when it comes to trying to impress other people and I know that's wrong.

It something I'm going to actively try to manage this year. Naturally, as someone at the bottom of the social ladder, this is easier said than done.

Disagree strongly. People on here post about being dishearted because people wrongly assume their intentions. Obviously they could need some advice on this.

>Then the problem is not with intention but communication.

Yes, exactly! That is the point



>You haven't really shown what the positive aspects are.

OP did. I won't take the time to explain to you in detail since OP did that excellently, but i can tell you the key aspects i get from this exact advice.

Self-dating: i feel appreciated and valued, i sometimes meet new people this way and experience new things.

Being selfless when meeting people: people feel comfortable with me and i never get sour when new people/strangers don't return my gestures.

Not giving a fuck: this is about picking battles, though. People instantly get the feeling that i don't judge and i speak my mind so they easily feel safe with me. People used to use me for this, but now i catch on to this and i just tell them how i feel about thst because i don't give a fuck if people will dislike me for who i am. If i lose someone i appreciate, heartbreak is a close friend and i know how to deal with pain. It's better than to give too many fucks.

285,rx470spaceheater,"What you describe is one specific problem you have (to which I can certainly relate), while someone else might have problems with a different point in the post, but the thing is, if he went into great detail for every single point, it would be 20x longer and nobody would bother reading all of it. People fill entire books trying to answer the question you're asking (how to have a good conversation). I don't know the answer myself, so I can't give any good advice, sorry. I guess it could help a bit to listen to other people have those kinds of conversations, e.g. at work (although they rarely get very personal...), and to try and notice how the conversation is propagated at each turn."

I would however never share any precious free time or food with them unless they showed some of the general niceness and interest.

This can happen for various reasons. In particular if you are a woman, people are 10 times more likely to speak to you and want to keep you company. The effect absolutely will not be the same for everyone.

331,quercusp,"Oh this is great, I seem to have the honor of being in conversation with a mod. So let me please take the opportunity to demonstrate to you a more elaborate view on IT.

>We also try our best to censor personal information including usernames and are against doxxing.

I think this goal is achieved. The dark side of this moon, is that in many cases I doubt, that the quoted examples are real at all, because there is no source given with them. Sometimes I assume that the quoted shit is indeed invented by IT users themselves. And to be strict, even if these examples are copied from braincels, it is still possible that they have been placed there by an IT user in order to further ridicule incels. But ruling out such skulduggery is out of scope of the mods.

Therefore let's consider the more obvious misbehavior as mentioned before, this time partly with source:

1. A bulk of 1100 IT users advocate blaming incels for desecration of dead bodies [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/98z2m8/what\_kind\_of\_expetiment\_is\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/98z2m8/what_kind_of_expetiment_is_it/)
2. A braincel post was quoted and actively ""enriched"" with the idea of  rape, just in order to once again accuse and ridicule incels. [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/99dx3c/incel\_cant\_understand\_why\_rape\_is\_bad\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/99dx3c/incel_cant_understand_why_rape_is_bad_and/)
3. Urging to suicide and bullying glorifying IT posts, collected by another user: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/95t5qq/it\_doesnt\_want\_to\_help\_incels\_they\_want\_us/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/95t5qq/it_doesnt_want_to_help_incels_they_want_us/)
4. Several times I tried to reasonably and modestly discuss with IT users. Never possible.
5. As sure as there is the amen in the church, any user in IT who tries to defend one aspect of incels, is downvoted. This happened not to just me.
6. Once there was the claim, that incels generally do not pay their taxes. I objected, that this judgement is not fair, and that I always paid my taxes. Immediate 40 downvotes.
7. A man left IncelTears because ""I can‚Äôt take it anymore"". The posts in this subreddit made him fear for the fate of his daughter. ""The mentality of an incel is sickening and frightening and to know that she could be one bad conversation away from being raped or murdered by one of them gives me panic attacks."" This is the result of this perpetual toxic rain falling from the IncelTears cloud. [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/995b3u/why\_i\_am\_leaving\_inceltears/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/995b3u/why_i_am_leaving_inceltears/)
8. One gets the impression that not only that all incels are rapist, but even worse, that all rapists are incels.
9. While there is hatred in Braincels against women, it is based of real personal bitter experience of their members. On the other hand the hatred in IncelTears against incels is mostly taken out of fresh air, based only on some idiotic utterances on the Internet. Most of these hateful IT user do not even know one incel in person.
10. The hatred of Braincel users is diffusely spread over half of humanity, while the hatred of IncelTears users is focused on a minority, the incel, which are suffering anyway from life. That makes quite a difference in severeness and pain it induces."
332,Board_Gaming,"If you find content that is against Reddit's content policy, then report it.

That sub is out to bully and harass people."
334,,"Main points is that human attraction is based mostly if not entirely on your appearance/sex appeal. If you lack that you cannot get a partner no matter what you do. IE if you're ugly you'll die alone with no hope to experiencing intimacy/sex without either paying for it (which wouldn't solve the incel issue since there is no love and the person you pay obviously does not like you or want to do it willingly, just for money) or having to get extreme reconstructive surgery to drastically altar your appearance to potentially attracting someone. 

Many examples of women taking interest in criminals because they are physically attractive whilst ugly men are shown to be either ignored or simply used as a means of monetary gain.   
When all this info comes to people who all their lives were led to believe women were all collectively these kind/gentle beings and that all you gotta do to get one's affection is to simply be a stand-up/well hearted person  only to learn that was all a lie, it can be VERY detrimental to a person's mind, emotions and overall outlook.  
It's a mixture of disbelief, confusion, anger/frustration that makes you question everything you thought was true, ON TOP OF knowing you aren't and will never be good enough. That dating is nothing more than a superficial rat race with little to no fulfillment and that society continues to place your worth as a man on whether you've had sex or not.

3. Some people believe that all bad things are caused by the incels. That is not true, but some people still believe that. They shouldn‚Äôt and is a poor judgement on their part.
4. If the subreddit scared him, he should honestly leave and will make no attempt to bring him back. But the world is, unfortunately, a very scary place where a lot of bad things happen.

Mainly the whole focus on ‚Äúwomen seek power and good looks and nothing else‚Äù bit. Remember, women are people too. The whole ‚Äúhypergamy‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt seem so strange if you reverse the role; if the princess of some country was in love with you, you would want to marry up if you could. And a lot of the time the whole ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù thing isn‚Äôt as clear-cut as it seems. Some of these people are actually good to them, even if they are standoffish jerks to everyone else. And sometimes it‚Äôs just honestly poor decision-making that comes with regrets. Lastly, appearance is NOT static no matter what you look like. Anyone can always shave, comb, exercise, wear nicer clothes, and change some little things. But it seems like for some of these people, they would rather blame something out of their control than put in hard work to keep themselves in a good position. It is a grim reality, but only if you think it is reality. Make sure to talk to a therapist if you need to."
344,browsingpornignoreme,In my book you're doing a pretty good job already!
345,Stormypwns,"You're right there. I'm not exactly in the same boat as most incels, as I do have some friends with whom I socialize regularly (I do have a job after all) but know that a lot of incels don't, and a good amount of them are agoraphobes, or would find a space like that threatening. My point isn't so much pertaining to myself so much as trying to help you understand the position that some of us are in. 

The fact is that despite your own good will, the majority (and I must stress that we're not just talking about the vocal few) on IT condone shaming and bullying incels. Sure, they're fucked in the head. You're right, but what IT does and perpetuates isn't helping anyone and is entirely detrimental. 

The purpose of the sub to begin with is to spread hate by shaming mentally ill people who obviously need some kind of help, if only an end to their misery. To IT's credit, there is quite a bit of encouraging us to commit suicide, which is fair enough. 

My point is that you take issue with the misogyny, hate, and perpetuation of violence that incels spread, while actively defending a group that majorly and by design perpetuates violence against incels under the pretense that ""Oh we're not all like that."" when infact that is what the sub was intended to be.

If you want to say we deserve more suffering, to kill ourselves, to be round up and shot, then fair enough. That's your opinion and you're welcome to it, I'm not even too inclined to say that it's the wrong one. At that point, however, you have to relinquish your moral high ground and realize that while operating on what is certain to be a drastically higher plane of intelligence quotient than us incels, IT still has the animalistic human desire to hurt and put others below themselves, wherever their conscience will allow."

348,quercusp,">1. Some people fake crap for karma. It happens.

Maybe, but this excuse is clearly not applicable here: 1100 upvotes for a hateful claim, means 1100 hateful people on IncelTears. Period.

>2. Some people don‚Äôt understand nuance and just bandwagon. That also happens.

This excuse only applies to IncelTears?

>3. Some people believe that all bad things are caused by the incels. That  is not true, but some people still believe that. They shouldn‚Äôt and is a  poor judgement on their part.

Some people believe that all bad things are caused by the *women*. That  is not true, but some people still believe that. They shouldn‚Äôt and is a  poor judgement on their part.

>4. If the subreddit scared him, he should honestly leave and will make no  attempt to bring him back. But the world is, unfortunately, a very scary  place where a lot of bad things happen.

If a subreddit scared *her*, *she* should honestly leave and will make no  attempt to bring *her* back. But the world is, unfortunately, a very scary  place where a lot of bad things happen.

See what I mean, why not applying this same reasoning to for example Braincels and leave these people there in peace?

>5. Hating more people doesn‚Äôt make it any better. Hatred of any group is a problem.

So why tolerate the hatred in IncelTears and not that in other subreddits?

>6. If somebody seriously says some of the things said on braincels, it  makes sense that people would be concerned. I don‚Äôt know David Duke in  real life but I know from his uttering on the internet that he is a bad  person.

Idk what you are referring to. What kind of things said on braincels? What's the context to a ""David Duke""?"

350,,"""The whole ‚Äúhypergamy‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt seem so strange if you reverse the role; if the princess of some country was in love with you, you would want to marry up if you could.""

No I wouldn't and most incels wouldn't either. It goes against their own beliefs of things like social status being an irrelevant trait. Even if I did, this argument is terrible since it's just some way to make it seem like it's ok for them be lonely and miserable because ""well u kno ppl wanna all d8 kings/queens bro"".

""But it seems like for some of these people, they would rather blame something out of their control than put in hard work to keep themselves in a good position. It is a grim reality, but only if you think it is reality. Make sure to talk to a therapist if you need to.""

Any person with an IQ above a single digit would rather not. Why would you put a bunch of effort for nothing? That thing out of your control determines the quality of your life as well? Also what ""good"" position? There were never in one lol."
351,gmmp1,"And what next? Every new social opportunity I get myself into I expect to be different but it's literally the same story since puberty.

My friends don't put themelves ""out there"" as much a I do because they aren't bottom whatever percent of male attractiveness. They've met their gfs through class or through mutual friends or a random hookup at a wedding. Nothing I do will ever yield those results - I've been doing those things for years and they've never gotten me anywhere close. What am I supposed to do? Same thing for the next 7 years until I'm 30 and some woman is sad enough to deal with me?  If no woman likes me now at 23 when every woman is looking for some guy, any woman who might like me later on must be out of desperation."
352,BlackMoonstorm,"As I‚Äôve stated before, suicide is not the answer. Originally, from what I can tell, the point of the sub was to make sure the ideology didn‚Äôt run rampant and uncontested in the market of ideas. Even though many people just bandwagon onto any group that‚Äôs against another group just to hate, from what I can tell that wasn‚Äôt the point of this subreddit.

And yes, I‚Äôm all in favor of people getting mental help. I‚Äôm sure most of us wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with the people themselves outside of their ideas. Why do you think incels complain so much that everyone says that they have a ‚Äúbad personality‚Äù? These people ostracized themselves, and the best answer is to get mental help. 

Nobody deserves to suffer, and being hateful because of self-loathing doesn‚Äôt fix anything. I haven‚Äôt heard anyone say they actively or passively wanted to commit an act of violence against anyone with the ideology because of the ideology. We aren‚Äôt against people getting mental help. We don‚Äôt hate the people. We are opposed to the ideas that stem from the damaged worldview that a large collective of people who need mental help have thought up. The original use of ‚ÄúIncel‚Äù was on a board to help the community before it spiraled out of control. If and when we hear that somebody is dropping the incel mindset through therapy, we don‚Äôt scream at them to get back to their hole. We support them and try to help them to rehumanize the people around them. 

TL;DR: Hateful people exist everywhere. People misuse power too. However, a group can still be good even if a majority of its members are not. "

355,BlackMoonstorm,"From what I can tell, 1100 is much less than the total number of subscribers to the subreddit. And this was about people faking posts.

The difference in the lack of nuance between IT and braincels is rather large. 

You made my point for me on number 3.

But IT say things that are actually true, not just peoples‚Äô world views.

I dislike the hatred on both sides. But disagreeing with an ideology does not mean hating everyone with that ideology.

A popular incel claim of self-defense is ‚Äúhow do they know we have bad personalities and aren‚Äôt just horribly ugly?‚Äù People on braincels have advocated for rape, incest, and pedophilia. David Duke is the current leader of the KKK. I‚Äôm not saying that incels are racist, but saying things equivalently hateful doesn‚Äôt look too good.

EDIT: Btw hatred does not justify more hatred. Saying that IT is hateful doesn‚Äôt mean that braincels gets the ‚Äúmean pass‚Äù too."

And this may come as a shock, but most of these ‚Äúhideous monsters‚Äù look perfectly fine, though they may not stand out. Your looks have far less of an impact on most things in life than other factors. E.G.

389,chalkandapples,"\> Isn‚Äôt it obvious enough that if you‚Äôre at least 18 years old and still a virgin that it‚Äôs because most women find you repulsive and that you‚Äôre a confirmed incel?

My brother and most his friends didn't even start dating until 20-21. Later parts of college when they're stable with their career (got good internships or an offer out of college). He did nothing except play video games with his friends throughout high school and was too busy trying to secure employment out of school early parts of college, and then suddenly got interested in girls after all that. I would say looks wise he's above average but still within normie range. He's VERY sweet and gentlemanly though. Like we used to role play pokemon and he would always let me be the stronger / type advantage pokemon so I can win and be happy, and he's my LITTLE brother so if anything I would be letting him win. 

I had problems dating because I'm very asocial and avoidant, but normal people like my brother and friends find relationships very naturally. Similarly it's much easier for him to walk into a social event or party and come out of it with new friends, while it's very hard for me to just make friends from one interaction."

393,ufixusif,Your IQ must be too low then.
394,chalkandapples,"I honestly think it has to do with the fact that we have a ton of more entertainment. We're not bored enough to desperately want to pair up and make kids. Relationships and kids are hard, there are a ton of entertainment that's easier to get and less stressful. It's much easier and simpler to spend a night playing my favorite video game than a first date. At the same time, stuff that's harder to get is more fulfilling and eventually might lead to more. But often we don't realize that, or the pain doesn't get as bad until we're older and got tired of cheap entertainment. 

I say this because I get into a lot of discussions with my parents/grandparents since I was single for so long, and they said when they were my age they really had nothing else to do other than start a family. Even job wise things were simple, they got a job and just kept working at it and they're promoted mostly based on seniority."

426,unknownhorrorwriter,"I have. I do it all the time and constantly post on various subs.

Regardless of how people wanna spin it, men have low self-esteem and body issues too. And I say this as a nice-looking guy with a big dick. I struggle with low self-esteem everyday. I don‚Äôt talk to women well, was bullied growing up, called ugly and creepy by women the majority of the time I tried to ask them out. I mean I‚Äôm not sure what the fuck people expect? The reality is as a woman, no matter how unattractive or ugly you are, you can make a Bumble or Tinder and collect hundreds of matches from hotter guys in minutes. Instant ego boost.

As a man on the same level, or even an unconventionally-handsome one like me, we don‚Äôt have that luxury. Instead, we stare at empty inboxes while women naturally gravitate to the smoking hot dudes. So yeah, I show off my big dick. Oftentimes, the woman will at least talk to me afterward and compliment me. Either way, it‚Äôs a fuck ton better than not getting any matches or endless read-not-replied messages. At the end of the day, most people use these shithole apps to feel hot. So women can post ass and boob shots for their profiles and I‚Äôm evil for showing off my long bulge? Fuck that.

Newsflash: it‚Äôs not a man problem but a desperation problem. I‚Äôve been sent unsolicited nudes and cyber-stalked by various women, and the common denominator was they were ugly as shit. Not just ugly, I mean UG-LEE. Like so ugly, they don‚Äôt even get attention on Tinder. They were dying for dick. The reality is desperate people do desperate things for attention. Women are no different than men. Studies have shown they are just as horny as men. They wanna feel hot too. There are just more desperate men as a result of guys being forced to go on the prowl while women can sit back and collect compliments/matches like Goddamn royalty. All women can do this too as long as they aren‚Äôt super ugly. Unlike men, where only the conventionally hot guys have this luxury. Plus, gender roles play a part as well (guys who have sex with a bunch of women are studs, women who have sex with a bunch of dudes are stigmatized as ‚Äúsluts‚Äù). Not to mention the VAST FUCKING MAJORITY of the time, men are the aggressor. They are expected to make the first move. Something women won‚Äôt comprehend as they essentially play the fucking waiting game. They will never experience the awkwardness of asking a woman out and not being sure if she‚Äôs attracted to you or not. Nor will she usually experience the soul-crushing fun of being rejected.

If gender roles were reversed, and women were forced to go on the prowl while even ugly men could sit back and collect matches all night, you‚Äôd have tons of non-hot women cyber-stalk and send unsolicited nudes for the dude‚Äôs attention. Especially since the guys would be focused on the superhot women. 

You‚Äôre telling me the okay/cute young woman with big boobs isn‚Äôt going to send unsolicited nudes to the hot guys ignoring her for the Instagram models? üòÇ No one is on those fucking apps to stare at an empty inbox.

This is just reality. People want attention and to feel hot. Deal with it."

In all honesty, I have found it quite easy to not send one of these unsolicited pictures.   Perhaps it is a generational thing.   At 43 years of age, I just don't remember ever thinking at any point in my life that this was a good idea.   It's always sounded more like a joking meme, and less like something people actually do.

557,SkyOminous,"**Well, kids spend most of their day in school, and that was a nightmare for me:**

Started out year one as some kind of prodigy. I was known as the smart one.

Constant physical and psychological bullying from both teachers and students at school.

Constant bullying from both educators and other kids at the after-school place I went to because my parents worked till late.

Can't relate to other kids. Pretty much friendless.

The only ""panic attack"" I've had in my entire life was caused by a teacher verbally attacking me for something I didn't even do. After that day I remember feeling dumber and slower each morning (dunno exactly what happened).

I talked back to my teachers when they were being idiots. Sometimes got written up for bad behaviour.

""Obviously"" kids are always wrong and adults are always right...

Constantly grounded at home.

My parents don't believe that my teachers are the problem. Instead, I'm the one to blame.

Had no motivation to study.

My grades kept plummeting.

I fail and have to repeat a school year.

Even more grounded. Can't even cope with video games any more.

9th grade arrives.

Finally have good teachers, my grades go from failing at almost everything to having max grades in most subjects.

Enter 10th grade in a new school. I realize that I'm so socially impaired that I can't even make friends.

I was once again known as the smart kid. Until that point I had actually forgotten that I was considered ""smart"" in the past.

Got called an autist. Even though I was offended, it made me research a bit about autism and I find out it would explain my hardships when growing up.

To this day my parents dismiss my suspicions. *""You don't look like an autist""*. Who even knows at this point...

Got my first crush. A girl from another class.

Took almost a full year to gain courage to talk to her.

Obviously, she already has a boyfriend. At least I managed to get a temporary friend.

12th grade arrives. I was once again bullied by a teacher.

Gym teacher, lies to other teachers about me and purposefully fails my grade. Once again, the adult is always in the right.

The sweetheart of my English teacher was the only one who believed me. She's probably the most empathetic human I've ever met.

School's over anyway. I'm now ~~19~~ 18. Begin university.

As a repeat of 10th grade, I'm unable to make any significant friends. I'm no longer the smart and talented kid (though I disagree I ever was), and I'm actually one of the worst in class. No friends, no girlfriend. Every girl has a boyfriend anyway, it never even began.

And here I am today. I wouldn't go back for anything."
558,soilednapkin,You know
559,randall-politics,"Nope, I just believe in miracles."
560,randall-politics,"Galatians 5:22-23

""But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.""

You say you are seeing a lot of sin in your life.  Well it is good, you are recognizing sin as sin, that is the first step.  Do you believe God can change your heart and change lives?  And are you willing to let him?  We all have things to work through, but if we are willing to change and willing to have faith it may be granted by God's grace.

Many have been through it, it has been recorded over the last 2,000 years. All manner of vices has been cleansed from people's lives, including my own.  You are no less worthy than the rest of us."
561,TheSoftParade69,"I had them from 2005 to 2009, I remember those models fondly. Each year their would be a new gimmick, like a new gun or spinner thingy. I didin't have a ton of money but whenever I did me and my brother would go out and buy our own canister. Then we'd play with them in our room, making up storylines and arcs."
562,Budget_Shift,For me I never really got better. I sort of drifted from one drug to the next trying to feel happy and content but never being able to. Like I remember wanting to die when I was like 8-9 years old but my attention span was so short I never stayed on it for too long. Its been a constant problem throughout my life.

Thats probably why they were bamboozled by your question.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right, I think everyone can have preferences, but I actually... I mean, it's semantics, but I don't think having reasonable preferences is ""shallow"". 

A girl saying she wants a guy who can actually take care of himself and make a half-decent living.. I think that's reasonable. Demanding a guy who makes over $100,000 a year and saying they'd never settle for less (when that's like... What, 10% of the male population)? That's shallow.

A guy saying he wants a girl in half-decent shape who isn't morbidly obese is fine IMO. Saying that a girl who has the slightest amount of extra fat on their belly is ""a fat whale who I'd never even look at"", would of course, be extremely shallow.

I'm throwing out crazy and more limiting examples when it comes to percentages of population. But look at average height in the United States. Saying you demand a guy be over 6 feet tall, when that excludes 2/3 of the male population, based on a SINGLE TRAIT... That's shallow. Look, I get it, some guys get the short end of the stick. Being 5'3"" as a guy is sure as hell to be a tough life. But DEMANDING the top 33% over a single trait (and not a collection maybe of ideal traits) means you're probably putting WAAAAY too much weight on that single trait, which again, I think is shallow. 

Going back to the income vs weight thing.. Actually, just look at how the two are treated. ""Young successful women are having a tough time finding dateable men! They're all poor!!"" You know, instead of saying ""Wow, this is a societal problem and men are suddenly not doing very well, and how can we fix that"", the responde is ""Men are doing badly... It sucks that women need to put up with that."" And then on the fat acceptance thing, ""No, you go girl! Society should conform to you!""

So I think these examples really come full circle. And the fact is... I agree with you on why the Tess Holiday situation is the way it is. It's about nothing but trying to appeal to a specific demographic that's extremely loud, and a movement that's very ""trendy"" right now. But I think my biggest point is that if it were talking about men, it wouldn't be ALLOWED to be trendy. ""Suck it up"" kind of thing. ""You're fat, and that's just against women's preferences sweetheart. Maybe if you would not be fat, you'd do fine!""

The attitudes on the same issues are so radically different that it's actually kind of insulting to basic intelligence. But then we can go into deeper philosophical discussions on how women are ""more valuable"" than men since they have a relatively long gestation period, and a finite number of eggs to reproduce, which could be why society (and men) naturally coddle women more. And I'm not even saying ""OMG, THAT'S WRONG, WOMEN ARE TERRIBLE!!"" Mostly, I'm just pointing out the double standards, and not saying any of this out of any real hatred. More like ""hatred of the game, but not the players""."
840,BlackHeart357,"Yes. Including me, and just about everyone else. The difference is that I'll admit it. Look, I'm on the chunky side, and I'm a 4 overall. But I'll 1000% admit I'm not eager to date a girl who's morbidly obese. I'm being real. And no, I don't expect a supermodel, either. I doubt I could relate to most anyway, so even on that level, it generally wouldn't work. Anyway..

Somehow, preferences for men have become prohibited. If you're a man, ""improve yourself"". If you're a woman, ""men should love you just the way you are!"" I'm exaggerating a bit, but you know what I mean.

Tell you what: Find me the male equivalent of Tess Holiday being on the covers of world-famous magazines whose covers are often centered around physical attractiveness. I'm SURE there's an exception somewhere, but like I said, you probably get what I mean to an extent.."

That's the reason you see women from 4'11 to 5'11 with the same requirement for a man to be at least 6 feet tall. It's not that the short women are ""more shallow"" or ""overcompensating"" and the taller women are ""more fair"", their own height just isn't important - what's important is that the male is **taller than other males** - because men are status objects to women and if a status object isn't fancier than the status objects of others, it's worthless.

Saying ""taller is more attractive"" is different than saying ""height is a REQUIREMENT"".  I've had this discussion with incels who explicitly exclude black women on the basis of their race. In my mind if I was in a situation where I became less attractive than before, the first thing I would compromise would be unalterable physical traits that have no bearing on character.

I have noticed that at least men will acknowledge this, whereas women seem to be deathly allergic to being labeled as shallow. I respect people who at least own their true beliefs even if I dislike them for it."
873,Squez360,">like someone not thinking you're attractive isn't shallow to me. you can't force someone to think you're attractive 

Do you know about the fat acceptance movement? It was not to make you find bigger women attractive. This is a social movement seeking to change anti-fat bias in social attitudes by raising awareness about obstacles faced by fat persons for the general public. Right now, men are being judged for their height (and other bone structures), but unlike weight, height is genetic and not hazardous to our health like obesity. There is ***nothing*** a man can do if he is being discriminated against by women for his height. Some women have said men who are shorter than 6ft are a [waste](https://twitter.com/sonessasary/status/561251830634524672), [useless](https://twitter.com/NonnyUzo/status/447928329157357568), and should [kill themselves](https://twitter.com/shawna_philly/status/490617982834728961). The point to show women's shallowness isn't to force a chick to like you for being short. It's to raise awareness of society's ugly attitude towards men's looks."

Status objects. And not necessarily solely, however it becomes more apparent in respect to romantic association and attraction, for those women who place a great value on male height - whether that's every woman in the world or only a part of them is up for interpretation. Outside of sexuality women can certainly see short men as platonic friends for example. 

>why do you think your life is the way It is?

Absurd question. Like everything in existence, ""my life is the way it is"" as a result of cause and effect."
896,weebmuttgymcel,"Facial attractiveness is not subjective. All attractive faces share certain features - defined jawline, forward growth, prominent zygos. 

You may think that there are lots of different kinds of attractive people, but that‚Äôs likely because you don‚Äôt even notice the unattractive males in your life. There are maybe ten ways to be attractive and there are a million ways to be ugly. 

It is the absolute definition of shallow to judge people based on their face. I see that this idea bothers you, because you are guilty of it. You are dismissing all of a persons accomplishments and their personality for a genetic marker that was determined at birth. How is that not shallow? Women literally don‚Äôt care what you‚Äôve done or how you behave. If you have an ugly face, you will never be dating material. If you have an attractive face, you will always be dating material. It doesn‚Äôt get any more superficial than that."

Relationships are often started for pragmatic, unromantic and unsexual reasons, more often in the past than in the modern age, and more often when women are past a certain era in their lives and opt for stability rather than excitement. The term ""beta bux"" is well understood in incel spheres. 

If you want to see evidence of height having decisive value for women, simply look at the tallest people on the earth, the [Dutch](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2015.0211). Or go to any dating site and look at the requirements women tend to list.

I would often go out there to try to think about where I went wrong with my life, contemplate suicide, or just to spend some time isolated from the rest of the world. Sometimes I would go out there and sing about how much I hated my life. I would stay on that swing until the wee hours of the night almost every day. It was fun, but at the same time, a way to cope with my painful life.

You know how easy it to be friendzoned by a girl? There is a cute girl where I work with who will hug and talk to ANYONE. She just won't fuck anyone who comes her way.

Now if that's what you TRULY want then the old just lift and shower bro thing will work. I however, suspect this is not the case. Interacting with women =/= attracting women. That's just the truth. If no one will even acknowledge you or listen to your problems, then it is something you are doing wrong.

This is coming from a socially awkward 24 year old college drop out KHV, so don't even start by Chading me. Yes, I lift. Yes women have made passes at me, but believe me that's not enough to get a relationship. The only time I've ever seen women literally throw themselves at men is if they are basically gigachad, which let's face it, he doesn't even care for the emotional support at that point. He just see women as another hole to stick his 10 inch penis in.

Edit: Minus the kissing and putting your face in her breasts thing. That's something only women who are into you will do, but that is kind of vaguely sexual anyway.

All Reddit links are NP links, in which you can find: Women talking about touching guys, including 'constantly', as a 'completely mild' flirting technique, including with guys they barely know and guys whose mind they clearly didn't 'read perfectly' because they ended up rebuffing them. Men talking about the physical shit that women are always pulling off with dudes they find attractive, including the posters, even though they find it 'creepy' - yet the women can always keep doing it scots-free. Women describing guys touching their lower waist or backs briefly as an acceptable 'signal' ( I.E, no explicitly consent or previous sexual relationship necessary ), and an article about flirting from researchers which states the following:

>""But what works better than anything else? Touching. And research has isolated which types of touching are regarded as ""merely friendly,"" in the zone of ""plausible deniability,"" or ""going nuclear"" - Friendly: Shoulder push, shoulder tap, handshake Plausible Deniability: Touch around the shoulder or waist, touch on the forearm.

>""What about for men? Touching **is almost always acceptable for women, but can get men in hot water real fast.**

No way researcher-kun! Really? Maybe your next study should be about who's responsible for pushing blatant double standards ( Hint: It's not the homosexual demographic ) , but then you won't be able to publish it, will you? So to summarize, don't forget to keep all of this in mind whenever some woman attempts to justifies *any* kind of criticism or punishment simply because someone dared to touch her arm. It's the same deal with 'creepiness', 'objectification' and bluntness, which is what I started my collection about - Wanna know which 'creepy' acts exist that women *haven't* seen fit to pull on Chads and then brag all over SexPositive, TrollX, AskWomen, GoneWildStories, and StupidSlutsClub about? Literally none. 80% of women are doing whatever they deem 'inappropriate' or 'dehumanizing' or 'too desperate' to hot guys they don't know, have no rapport with, and never established consent with a thousand times over, and evidence is plentiful."

Nursery is Kindergarten and is a preschool environment.

Kids start primary school at around 4 years old, and this goes from Reception to Year 6, though sometimes schools are split between infants (R - Y3) and junior school (Y4 - Y6)

Years 7 to 11 are secondary school and go up to when someone is 16 years old. 

A Levels (AS and A2) are generally done in sixth form and go between 16 and 18 years old. When I was studying, this stage was not mandatory. Sixth form is often referred to as college in the UK while university is either called that or 'uni' for short.

A decade ago, the minimum age to legally leave school was raised to 17, meaning AS Levels are effectively mandatory."

In Latin America and East Asia. You need to travel abroad.

> When they talk about white men they talk about tall good looking Chads.

Remember that the average height is shorter over here, so a man who's average in Europe and North America could be considered tall by Latin American and East Asian standards.

> But I'm sure they will even bang Arabs as long as they are hot and tall.

That's true. The heightpill beats the racepill. You're right in that being white is not enough. The advantage that white men have in the international dating market derives mainly from the fact that white men tend to be taller on average than other ethnic groups."
1157,,No we don't believe in that. Did you wonder why it made the news? Because it's wrong and shocking! Now explain to me how this equals those damned invaders screwing your precious children or that it's somehow in our religion to screw children. We actually do have laws on marriage and l am a Sunni Muslim not Shia.
1158,,You are going to ignore the part where it's banned meaning illegal huh? Well you spin it however you want. I heard you Jews fuck kids too. Look there's Epstein and everyone knows that doctrine means nothing. He was a Jew and fucked kids therefore you are a pedophile too.

It all depends on what they can get where they are. Travelling abroad isn't my cup of tea and never will be. We get the same thing here in Australia .

1161,,"Not so much the point about child marriage. My point is with the Brits-
who are throwing the book at this guy for touching an adult woman, let things like that slide because they don't want to look racist to that sect who does that. There were cases in the news of grown men taking advantage of very young girls in England, and the law turned a blind eye. They weren't Jewish or Christian either. 

It may be wrong and shocking to the western world but they seem to be fine with it. I'm sure it is not everyone, but they seem pretty proud of what they do."
1162,,"The man making this statement seems (maybe not) to be a religious representative of the community. It seems the government is the one prohibiting this terrible thing, but the core religion (or some crazy sickos) seems to be ok with it. 

As for Jews, yes, there is scripture condoning ""marriage"" with girls at very young ages (even younger than stated). I don't believe they consummate though until they are older, but the idea being the woman has no say in the marriage.
Obviously today no one does that.

Epstein is far from an example of the Jewish community, where merely touching a woman that isn't your wife comes with very major ramifications, if you believe."
1163,KahnSuperphone,"Non-white girls from 1st world countries such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong also have a strong preference for white men."

Of course you were there and heard all of the evidence from this ""grown woman"". You were also there for the cases of these very young girls? You saw the court permissible evidence and determined that the court did not want to look racist? You now know these child molesting pedophiles to know they seem proud? How exactly did they show you they were proud? I will assume for the sake of argument that you can link me these stories of these men looking smugly at the camera holding up signs of guilt and looking proud.  Otherwise you're another racist. Isn't that cute that it shouldn't be assault for a white kid, but damn those invaders you never met either. Totally not racist. Believe all women, but only if he isn't white! How does that work in your head?"
1165,,Our governments are based on Sharia law aka the Qur'an. Rape is not okay. It's punished by death. In Islam you can not force a woman to marry you or purchase a wife from her father or anyone else. That is rape and always had been. It was never allowed in Islam. You're spouting racist bullshit again.
1166,Budget_Shift,"They have a preference for white CHADS. Not white men. If I went to any of those countries I guarantee I wouldn't get a single girl. But, then again, why would i? A part of the reason we are in this mess is because people wont stay in their lane."

17 is actually totally legal in NYS. I don't make the laws, and I'm not saying what he did is 100%, but the punishment should fit the crime. 10years and a sex offender registry is probably a minimum punishment for rape, and people get much less even doing that.

 There was a case here where a teacher slept with a student (actually a lady teacher) and the whole case was if it happened a few days before he was 17 or after :lol:. If it was after the cops said it is waste of our time. I think it got thrown out because they could never determine the date."

He only touched a strange girl and your defense is that she's old enough to fuck? He assaulted her the second time knowing she wanted nothing to do with him. She said he was smirking. It was also in a secluded area that he waited for her. That is not the same as oh they arrested him for touching her arm.

Its so fucking tiresome seeing these comics presenting incels as ugly when the same geniuses tend to keep telling incels looks dont matter. why isnt the ridiculous strawman caricature tall, wide framed and square jawed and fit instead of fat and ugly? it almost seems like looks do actually matter and its so very hard to effectively mock people without attacking their looks.

2. has the ""artist"" spent more than 5 minutes in any incel space? its a generally accepted axiom among incels that fatcel=volcel. this ""incels don't shower lmao"" idea also seems to be a pure projection coming from people with questionable hygienic habits themselves (=IncelTears) , and based on absolutely nothing. it's just another strawman attack to make the incel detractors feel good about themselves and like the world is a just place because incels are obviously so ridiculous they wear dirtied pedo anime tshirts outside."

1179,I-N-S-T-A-L-L,"The first panel are the black-pilled men and the second panel are the ""tfw no gf"" men. Both are incels.

The principal fault of the first half isn't that the arguer is a strawman. There are plenty of people, like me, who think this way because we are incapable of looking away from reality and lying to ourselves. No, the principal fault is that the argument is a strawman by omission. The problem isn't that women date up, but that what they define as ""up"" is based primarily on things men can't control (e.g., height, face, and dick size). Meanwhile, men tend to have less stringent standards on what they define as ""up"", so the average woman has a more vibrant sex life than the average man.

On the second panel of the first half, when I, and others like me, say it's ""disgusting"", I'm being sarcastic. That shit is actually life fuel for me. But I know that, subconsciously, the vast majority of humanity will think this way, so I'm just echoing their sentiments as part of the joke.

Especially as a lonely guy there are times where you are sad and angry that this other dude that is similar or even worse looking/fat has a gf and you dont.

About the 3rd pic in my opinion it is a bit laughable how some girls get away with just being ""normal"" while guys / their boyfriends are clearly putting much more work into it but its not something I often think or care about.

Ive made some comics before and in a few of them I pointed out mental health problems. When they got posted on IncelTears, the reaction was always that the ITers said that the character in the comic who was depressed was also a misogynist fascist child rapist.

This kinda gives off the message that even if youre just identifying As an incel and you arent hateful at all, people will just accuse you of misogyny, rape, pedophilia, fascism, etc. So at this point whats the point in not being hateful, when you get the same treatment either way?

Also even if you exit the incel community, your life can still be ruined if someone finds your old account, even if you havent posted any hateful stuff. (A story like this was posted to IT once, OP was a woman proud of basically destroying his ex boyfriends life based on his old incel account, on wich he havent posted anything hateful)
So Whats the point in leaving than?


The whole attitude IncelTears has towards incels is exactly what traps incels in these spaces where only a very few not pick up the misogynistsic attitude.
And this is a huge problem, because you might say IncelTears isnt that big of a community, but millions of people get the definition of incel from inceltears, automatically making them think ""all incels""

This could be fixed by a stickied post on there addressing that not every incel is misogynistsic.

I know this uses a somewhat looser standard, but given that its been long established men tend to lie and say they have more sex than they do (while women lie the opposite way), I think a quarter is a pretty good estimate."

The average age of virginity loss in the US is 17. Given this statistic inherently leads to extremes in the old side (i.e. it is possible for that to happen at 22, or even 32, but nearly impossible at 12), the ""typical"" age would be slightly lower than 17.

I live in the UK, where despite the ""stiff"" stereotypes, university accommodation is a complete sexfest for non-incels, and most people enter at around 18.

1266,weirdshit777,"I don't think that's a good statistic. A person who hasn't had sex in the past year is not an incel.

You may have a good idea, but there's still a lot of hope being so young. (See below)

Here's a statistic I found- (This is in the US, btw)
https://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/how-many-people-die-virgins-never-have-sex.htm

""Between 12-14% of adults have never had sex between the ages of 20-24""

""Only 5% of people have never had sex between the ages of 25-29""

Notice the huge drop? 

""And around the age 44, only 0.3% report never having sex.""

Personally, I think 25% of all young men being incels is just you huge of a stretch, and just not realistic. BUT in some countries such as Japan, that may be the case. 

""By contrast, in 2010, 25 percent of unmarried Japanese men over the age of 30¬†reported being virgins.""

I'm sure teenage boys might be somewhere around the 25% mark, but I wouldn't call them incels."

You‚Äôre at school to enrich your mind and improve your lot in life, and it‚Äôs completely unacceptable to be subjected to this sort of abuse.  That‚Äôs what it is.  You need to have some courage and assert your right to be present.  I think this is probably what a lot of women refer to when they mention ‚Äútoxic masculinity.‚Äù  For most men, if they don‚Äôt assert themselves, they open themselves up to this sort of behavior.  If you cultivate an air of completely not caring what anyone thinks of you, it helps a lot in dealing with these situations."

Meanwhile, I‚Äôm sitting here still a lonely depressed virgin. There are legit girls throwing around pussy and sleeping with anyone at university, but they still won‚Äôt sleep with me or give me a chance. 

People won‚Äôt even ask me for help in my classes. I‚Äôm literally ranked #1 right now in my class. I have a perfect 4.0 GPA as of the end of last semester. I have 3 more semesters to go before I‚Äôm done, but just need to get 3 more perfect GPA semesters and I will have officially graduated at #1 in my class, at the #1 University for my major in the country.

PLEASE DO NOT COME FOR YOUR OWN WELLBEING. You will really want to rope after you get mogged by your typical 180cm asian high school kid.

But any time me and a woman are about to get intimate, I wake up or the dream changes. 

Sex is like the most sacred thing, my brain can‚Äôt even let me dream about what it might feel like.

I‚Äôm almost 24, and what you guys call me is a TRUECEL (never had sex, never kissed, never even held hands, nothing).

It‚Äôs really not just about sex. It‚Äôs about sex, but also BEING DESIRED, being cared about in that special way, being chosen over all other guys, being accepted despite my flaws, having real conversations, being listened to, having someone to just hold and cuddle sometimes, not even always just after sex (but certainly after sex), someone to play video games with, or at the very least, watch me play, watch movies and shows together, if I‚Äôm really lucky, even engage in my taboo fetishes/kinks, and maybe she has some for me to get into as well.

I will listen to her, respect her, and constantly remind her how much I love and care for her. I won‚Äôt be afraid to show my emotions like so many guys are.

I still think there was more of an element to that in Braincels and it made me even more depressed, even if this place feeds the fire for me as well..

1504,Saddam420,Very nice. Next month I am coming up on six years since my last hug so I'm not gonna lie this is pretty painful to read now. I had a horrific caffeine-induced panic attack in public last semester and nearby was a big group of business school undergrad kids. They came over to help when my legs wouldn't hold me up and I wound up coiled to the fire hydrant like a boa constrictor trying to soothe myself (and maybe open the thing to attempt a self-baptism?) and two of them were girls that both rubbed my back and it was helpful.
1505,Mr-PoopyBhole,Hey I‚Äôm happy for you man any progress is good 
1506,BraisedBuster,"Happy for you, my man. Sounds awesome "
1507,Muffcakelord,"Getting compliments on your smell is basically as intimate as a hug too, congrats!"
1508,MotherOfLogic,"It was the fragrance and your approach. Just right. Keep at it, and act suave/reserved, she'll grow fonder. "
1509,BlackHeart357,"Hey man, small steps! One thing is for sure. If she thought you were gross, she def would never hug you. It's a start, right? :)

&#x200B;

Progress, not perfection."
1510,Unknown_Predator88,Save some pussy for the rest of us chad
1511,H20cel,Congrats man! That‚Äôs awesome
1512,NeckMasseuse,"That's nice, but if youre very unattractive AND socially awkward, she was probably being nice.

It is nice, and comfort is good, but dont go dreaming up romantic fantasies.

In my experience, a lot of people (men or women) get a kick out of being generous, it doesnt mean they like you romantically or in a platonic since, even that they'd stand by you when things get tough.

Just wanted to taper your expectations, take care!"
1513,thenameofshame,"I don't want to artificially get your hopes up, because it IS possible that she is just one of those people who is unusually friendly and a rampant hugger, but to me as a woman, those are some pretty strong indicators of interest.  The only other reason I could think of is if you actually sit at her tables frequently and give her huge tips, although even in that case she could very well still be interested in you.

The fact that she essentially said that she missed you and that you smell good are the reasons why I think this, even more than the fact that she hugged you.  I don't know any woman who would act in that specific manner and NOT be somewhat interested.  Those were actions she did spontaneously without you asking for them and without you being sad and her pitying you or anything like that.

It might sound a little weird, but I also congratulate you for paying such close attention to her behavior and picking up on these signals.  My boyfriend had Asperger's, and he literally had his female roommate undressing in front of him trying to get his romantic interest because nothing else she was doing was working.  He was completely blind to these obvious cues, and it happened with a couple of other women too.  

I am quite familiar with the restaurant business in general, and it is pretty frequent for staff members to socialize after work by having a few drinks together at their bar.  One relatively low risk way to spend more time with her and gauge her interest would be to ask her if she'd like to have a drink when her shift is over (or coffee if it's a day shift).  If she agrees to get a drink together, that's a decent clue that she is interested.  If she says something like ""maybe"" or ""I'm really busy right now so..."" or something hesitant like that, then she is likely NOT interested."
1514,glassangelrose,That's awesome! Maybe try to hang out with her more? Do you guys have any common interests? 
1515,SaturdayMorningSwarm,Yo what soap/bodywash and deodorant do you use man? I wanna smell good too.

1518,ExistentialAmbiguity,Now you get to unsub!
1519,pauly1993,"Good for you man, next time you do get the chance to hug her include a small compliment, her hair, make-up, maybe a watch or peice of jewelry she has on and guarantee it'll make her smile which will make you smile and may give you a chance for more small talk which could even evolve to a full conversation."
1520,alajameen,Here‚Äôs to more hugs my man 
1521,anxietycel_hopecel,"She told you that you smelled good. That's all the IOI you need, you're already in. In her mind she has accepted you as a potential mate but it won't last long. If you don't act soon it will be too late, she will lose interest in you if you don't have the confidence to go after what you want. Decide what you want to do with her then try and make it happen, smoothly.

It doesn't matter if you fuck it up and humiliate yourself, you need the experience of trying so that the next one will be easier. And if a girl is telling you that you smell good then there WILL be another girl that feels the same eventually (as long as you don't let yourself go)."

1561,SpiritDCRed,"I don‚Äôt really know if getting into the habit of giving people hugs is the best idea. The goal isn‚Äôt to collect hugs, it‚Äôs for people to be comfortable enough around you to build a friendship and possibly a relationship. Hugging people on a regular basis doesn‚Äôt seem like the most normal thing to do, and the only people I know who did that ended up being recognized as quite odd."
1562,nmaddine,sexual harassment accusations incoming...
1563,Rammspieler,"I don't know. I've never encountered a non-wealthy, non-famous ugly dude with a girlfriend in real life before."
1564,,"Maybe they were naturally odd or felt weird doing it...If so. ...then a hug is going to come across as odd

If it's natural for you...its natural for them....if its awkward for you...its awkward for them 

The goal is not to collect hugs...its to become comfortable and feel natural giving them out...which isn't possible if you are ashamed of hugging people....only way to get over a fear is to face it

I'm not gonna pretend that this would be an easy thing to get the hang of if some one is awkward. Like developing any new skill there is an initial cringe barrier to get over. Like it took me a while to get used to kiss on cheek as a greeting in south America...it wasn't normal by my culture....but when i returned home i would still sometimes cheek kiss greet strangers despite it not being a cultural norm 

And of course....use due diligence as to who to hug and when to hug and when not to...dont have to hug absolutely everyone . i didn't kiss absolutely everyone. Deoends on circumstance and social setting.

And last but not least....there are 2 ways to get to the truth... Experience or Theory. You can theorize what will or will not work or you can theorize based on other people's experience (which may or may not be fully competently executed ), but most reliable is testing stuff based on your own experience....and that requires a bit of trial and error and an initial sucky period....until you develop a natural ability.....and that assumes that experimenting is conducted competently and thoroughly and not just give up after a few failed attempts. "
1565,___XANDER___,Have you met many working class married men? Some of em look like alcoholic prunes and yet they have happy marriages and kids
1566,SpiritDCRed,"I‚Äôm not an incel, I‚Äôm just lurking out of curiosity and thought I‚Äôd put in my .02. I hug people on a daily basis, but they‚Äôre my family and my girlfriend, and sometimes close friends if I haven‚Äôt seen them in a while. I just thought that might be a risky move for some, especially because the incels I know irl are not very socially comfortable. 

Perhaps this is a result of the culture in my area. Who knows."
1567,Rammspieler,Then they must be running dark triad gene game.
1568,,"It's most likely a cultural thing...dont know where you are from but when i visited Canada...even hugs were received awkwardly by a lot of girls....i didn't care, i did it anyway because its part of who i am...its not my issue if someone finds it awkward...its their issue to deal with. 

It's definitely risky....and you never know who is or isn't going to feel awkward....and its definitely more difficult for socially uncomfortable people....i don't anticipate that many people will try this....but its a fact that emotional freedom cannot be found inside your comfort zone. ..infact everything your heart desires is outside of your comfort zone.  And we only achieve the life we want by pushing boundaries and risking embarrassment....and experiencing awkwardness "

I LMAO at the gatekeepers who claim you ""gotta have dating experience to be a MGTOW"".  Such bullshit.  The problems in the dating game are so bleeding obvious today that even a kissless virgin can see it.  You can learn a lot just from outside observation, and the guy who learns from OTHERS' mistakes is a lot smarter than the guy who has to actually go through it before waking up.

You don't see why it is wrong to use and abuse humans? Seriously, the more I read the more it is not surprising me that dating is as fucked as it is nowadays.

I don't think you understand what ""following the other sheep"" means. If everyone is breathing, you have to breathe. If every employer needs a college degree, you have to get a college degree to get employed. ""following the sheep"" would mean trying to betabux an old, overweight female with absurdly high bodycount, which no incel is currently doing. Given that you're on an incel subreddit, I think it is safe to assume you don't have money, connections or power to implement the large scale societal changes that you wish to implement. Your entire proposal is : ""lets just believe enough in our own values so hard that society starts adopting our values"".

You lack the self awareness to understand the blackpill and you fail to consider that the rest of society does not give a shit.

Downvoting everything that faintly resembles ""the enemy"" or his arguments while completely ignoring what he actually says it utterly stupid, by who ever does it. I experienced this behavior mainly in IncelTears.

* I was downvoted to -40 for just stating that I always paid my taxes (countering the claim that incels do not pay their taxes)
* I was downvoted by an IT lady on every single answer of mine to her in a some 14 step dialogue. I could finally tell from the vote counter, if she had already read my most recent comment.

I concluded that this must be the way IT mercenaries are programmed.

I think it's fair to say that IT shines more light on Incel subs etc and shows people where to go (before braincels got banned, lots of members said they found their way there purely because of IT). 

So being that IT is causing more people to ""join inceldom"" (as you may put it) and shines a light on those places etc, will IncelTears ever shut down? If you truly cared about keeping potential ""would be incels"" away from there, surely you'd want to remove their #1 advertising source?"

People who don't have any friends or many friends and have trouble making friends or even talking to people.

This lady who used to visit a bar I frequent almost separated with her husband because he gained too much weight. This thot I am friends with on Facebook only wants guys with big cocks regardless of how nasty they are to her.

Why do they call us misogynists when they are the ones who proclaim women are a magical species that have transcended the bounds of human nature and all of a sudden no longer care about looks? They're the ones putting pussy on a pedestal, not us. Women are still human beings and humans are a very superficial species.

I believe this is the well intended point gentlemen. That just because one is not a male nor ugly does not mean they cannot relate to mistreatment nor dating incompetency. 

I think the value in this is not to discredit the pain or agony of others nor to hold to it that whoever has suffered more egregiously is better than those who have suffered less. The lesson here is that we all suffer and only through shared understanding, empathy and compassion can we go on to recognize unhealthy symptoms occurring in our society and work united to solve them.

Wait, so you say you would never date a trans woman, no matter what she looked like, no matter how much your personalities fit? Thats is incredibly idiotic. Your dick doesn't have a built-in chromosome detector, you know?

When you meet a girl through a friend, that will give you more credit and it's more likely that she will judge you by your personality first, which will raise your chances a little bit. Let's say that 1/4 girls will be into you and you are acquainted with 5-20 girls.

An incel might be a guy who was always bullied or an outcast, for various reasons, which lead up to him having a small circle of friends, if he has one at all, most of which probably are male(cause same sex friendships usually have lower standards). That means he will be acquainted to no girls or, in very rare cases, a couple. If he's average looking, he has a  1/5 chance of a girl liking him for his looks, but we can assume he's not used to flirting, so he'll probably blow up the few chances he gets without realizing it.

That means that the only thing he can resort to is casual and online dating, which is already hard for an average guy, but for an ugly guy with not much flirting skills it's near impossible.

An average looking woman, on the other hand, will be considered reasonably attractive by, let's say, 4/5 guys. Even if a guy doesn't find a girl attractive, he might want to settle for it because most guys don't get many chances and being kind to a normal guy is usually enough for an average girl to bump her chances up. Moreover, girls have stronger friend circles and there's more collaboration among them, which means most average girls will have connections with 10-100 guys.

The closest a girl can get to being an incel is to have no friends and be unattractive. That still means 1/5 guys will probably be into her, which are the chances of an average guy. That means that, with casual and online dating, she has a pretty good chance of finding a match.

Now the real reasons girls say they're incels is A they are ""shy"" (they are cold and show disinterest whenever a guy talks to them) or B they can't get the guy they want (they won't even look for other options so if he rejects them, they're done) or C they want an attractive guy (usually in a high enough league that girls are already flocking to him). These reasons aren't mutually exclusive.

So you can see how women usually create the trouble for themselves.

TL;DR: ""incel"" women are usually doing better than average guys. That's why we consider them volcels"

You also don't really feel attraction the way men do. For us, we will probably be into most girls physically and, if they're nice to us, that's all we need. Women are more picky and very rarely can only use physical attraction as a standard (which in my opinion is often the case for girls being single).

These are all things incels have been talking about for a long time but people won't give us credit just because, well, just as we get bullied in our private lives, we get bullied online.

What most women fail to understand is that it's a hundred times more likely for Chad to be the violent guy and the abusive one, but I think they ignore it because they get so rarely aroused just by the looks of a guy that they can't handle it and it's like their brain becomes instinctive and the danger becomes fun (until they've been with him for long enough to realize how bad the situation is).

You don't just talk to guys who are attracted to you. First of all, at least give them a shot instead of trying to predict if they will like you or not. If they don't but you get along, actually make friends with them and get them to introduce you to their male friends. If your standards aren't Chad level you'll find someone after getting close to at least 10 guys 100%. Also give it time if you're actually unattractive.

>I talk to guys at Meetups. I talk to guys at conventions

Your hypotheticals are fun, but not founded in any actual evidence. If everybody had their own very specific preferences, something like attractiveness would not exist as a concept and the beauty industry wouldn't exist. Just look at how homogenic the ratings on subs like /r/Rateme are.

I recently lost my access to my old uni account, so finding studies to prove my point has become a little harder. The good, old, horribly overused [Tinder article](https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a) is pretty enlightening though.

Because the data is based on Tinder, it is mostly limited to visual attraction. The base result is that men swiped  right on far more women of all attractiveness levels. That clearly proves that men considered way more womens looks to be acceptable.

Because I have had this discussion a few times, I'll just disarm the usual counter arguments in advance to save everyone the time.

* ""Many men swipe right on everybody and then filter out afterwards."" While this is true, this doesn't disprove my point. This strategy only works for men if they would have liked the vast amount of women anyway, otherwise they wouldn't save much time at all.
* ""Maybe women just like every attractiveness level equally, leading to this distortion."" Interesting thought, but this would lead to a noticeable advantage for very unattractive men over very unattractive women, visible as an effect in the lower left corner. And there is no such thing on display.
* ""Tinder means nothing."" Yes, it does - especially when you want to talk about physical attractiveness. I would argue it gives even better data than actual studies, because the participants did not feel observed and under societal pressure.
* ""Tinder is just about hookups."" For pretty much everybody, the first step into a relationship is a hookup, so this is a very relevant metric. Funny enough, I recently saw a study that pointed out that something like 20% of asked couples met on Tinder or a similar app.
* ""Who cares about statistics, you only need to find one person that fits!"" Even conventionally attractive people have huge issues finding permanent partners. And the smaller the dating pool, the smaller the chance of meeting someone like this.

&#x200B;

So instead of telling everyone that they will definitely find someone if they just hang in for long enough (just world fallacy), you should accept that millions of people just won't. Thats not great, but you can't fix that. If you want to help, help them finding ways to live with it instead."
2151,le_ebin_trolecel,">what would you refer to as a hot chick

A 3rd degree burn victim that is obese, toothless, bald and never showers of course. Objective attractiveness has been done several times, and another poster even said you're aware of this which just proves you're arguing in bad faith here.

>maybe shes only hot in your eyes

Thats not objective though, thats subjective. You can delusionally believe the burn victim i described above is a beautiful person but you're deluded if you believe everyone else will agree.

>maybe she writes X in her diary

No the plan is to cope together until accession or death

The difference is normies still have hope and look like humans

I have a hard time believing that there is a physical look that is indicative that someone is violent.  Good looking men with crappy characteristics are certainly traps for women (Ugh . . Ted Bundy . . Ugh).  The same could be said of good looking women.

2171,giantillusion,">Good looking men with crappy characteristics are certainly traps for women 

This is what I was talking about.

You can get a lot of evidence for that. The most basic for is when on r/tinder (I don't know what they're up to now and don't wanna check) there was the meme among Chads of starting the conversation with ""do you like being chocked?"". If an incel did that they would be reported or if a IT member found out they'd swat his house.

It's kinda sad but some I saw some people trying to start conversations with texts from r/creepypms or saying they're rapists and nazis while using a really handsome profile picture and tons of girls responded saying ""that's ok as long as the sex is good"".

You can also see that with fandoms of shitty celebrities or asshole tv characters or straight up murderers in jail, some girls get even more turned on at the idea that they are the special one who gets the best part of a dangerous man.

It's like women are using a different part of their brain when dealing with hot guys. Again NOT ALL WOMEN but generally speaking, hot guys always get away with more than ugly guys and that means they will have less inhibitions in good and bad ways.

I'm sure there's some study about it on r/blackpillscience, but I haven't visited that sub in a long time and it's late, so maybe I'll pull it up tomorrow.

Either way, I'm not just trying to claim that all Chads are evil, they just get away with more and many girls don't really care, specially in the beginning, so they might get stuck in an abusive relationship.

Incels on the other hand don't really want anything more from a girl than being hugged and being told ""I love you"""

I know what fucking ER is and even if I didn‚Äôt I understood how to red around words you mook"
2181,Bekiala,"I think you are making an accurate assessment.  I tend to think that it is  young women who are more vulnerable to the good looking assholes.  Not always but most people tend to get wiser with age. (Note I think this is true for the guys too)

> Incels on the other hand don't really want anything more from a girl than being hugged and being told ""I love you""

I would argue that incels are as diverse as most groups of people.  There are some spectacularly horrible ones and probably some spectacularly great ones (of course the later don't make the news . . .sigh)"
2182,Board_Gaming,">Incels on the other hand don't really want anything more from a girl than being hugged and being told ""I love you"" 

Being hugged and told ""I love you"" sounds awesome."

2184,Board_Gaming,">she is so beautiful many men will not even approach her

Isn't the solution in her case to approach men and ask them out instead?

2189,DubsPackage,"> What it would do make us feel more human and less outcast. For myself  it‚Äôs more about self hate than women. More about just being happy or even just okay with how i look

There you go, you nailed it.
It's about needing someone to validate you, that you're ok and worthy, so you can feel comfortable in your own skin.

But doesn't it pop out at you that that's a mental trap that goes on forever? Like...""I fucked a 6, why can't I fuck a 9, am I not worthy? Am I not good enough?""

Because you can scrape together 50 bucks and go get a blowjob, in other words, sex is on tap anytime you want it. But that's not good enough, it doesn't provide enough validation.

See in reality there's really no such thing as an incel, you can go beta bux and get a wife. But that doesn't provide the validation you want either.

So it's an ego problem, an endless desire to be validated.

See next paragraph.

> They aren‚Äôt balding alien looking framelets. I‚Äôm seriously not even >exaggerating.

Lookism itself is kind of like a mental disease.

I'm not saying you're not ugly, I'm saying I'm ugly too, the difference being I don't give a shit and you're obessessed with it.

Also I have a broader perspective on looks vs attractiveness. Looks is the raw material, an uncut diamond. Attractiveness is the setting, the cut, etc. So at least %60-%70 of that, we have control over it.

I can't do much about having the physique of an ogre. But I can put on a dark suit, slick back my hair and clean up well.

That's Looks vs Attractiveness.

> Not the ‚ÄúNormal situation‚Äù to be 23 HHKV (I know HHKV is a cringey >term, just making it clear my experience is literally zero) who has never >been in a date or successfully gotten a number. 

I think most 23 year olds are KHHV.

But again. $50 blowjob. You can go lose that v-card anytime you want.

> ‚ÄúBig three story house‚Äù nice humble brag

Well I put that there for a reason.

a. It's nice to have things to brag about
b. Life isn't just about getting pussy, it's also about living well in general, living the life
c. If you offer me a choice between fucking a 9.5 and getting $1000, I'll take the $1000, because $1000 buys alot of 9.5's, and 9.5's are mostly just fakeup anyway, beneath the thin venier of hollywood glamour, they're the same fugly alien as you or me, 2 pounds of baloney in a 1 pound dress.

Hollywood is fake, it's bullshit, this whole world is fake. Fake politics, fake beauty, fake money, fake security, fake countries, fake issues, fake religions, fake jobs producing fake value, fake freedom, fake democracy, you're living in the matrix buddy boy.

Men like you built civilization. From dirt. From nothing.

The hollywood 9.5 isn't the real value. You are. But you're too busy crying and moaning into your beer about being a framelet or whatever. You bought into this stupidity hook, line and sinker.

> Hilarious that this is the guy shitting on inkwels and telling them to kill > themselves 

Yep.

So next time you think normies must be having wild monkey sex on the roof, think back to the normie in the big house watching ER.

This is what normies do. This is normie life. Every day isn't a party.

%99 of the time, I'd rather be sitting alone watching old reruns. If some chick rang my doorbell, I would tell her to get off my lawn.

My father was like this too. He was king chad. But he was like ""fuck these bitches, they give me a headache,"" and he would go off into the woods with his best friend, they would catch fish and cook it over a fire. No women, no nothing, ahhhh peaceful life.

What I'm describing of course is a kind of mgtow thing. The mgtow ideal. Women are a nuisance. Self-important pests.

You wanna become a real man someday? Have 2-3 male buddies.

That's all you need in life for ""validation"" or anything else."
2190,giantillusion,"That's true, not all incels are good and not all Chads are bad. That never was what I was trying to argue. I personally had to deal with some disgusting incels and Chads in my life.

What people seem to ignore is that lonely men are a large part of the population and assuming that a big chunk of them is murderers and rapists makes statistically no sense, as the part of the population who has severe enough mental issues is really small and it includes both good and bad looking guys (the famous Elliot Rodgers was a handsome guy and didn't classify as an incel. He was just a maniac who hated women).

You asked for studies and here I deliver: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440510000154

http://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167214543879

Basically psychology points to the fact that aggressive men are considered more attractive and that attractive men get a pass for being aggressive. That includes things like bullying, pushing themselves onto a girl and being manipulative.

It's true, most women grow out of liking them as they get older, but you also have to realize that the good Chads are usually the ones with the highest standards and the first to be taken. So you're left with the bad Chads and the incels. Most women will go after bad Chads for most of their life, until they really need to settle and compromise by finding an ugly and uncharismatic man in a stable enough situation"
2191,giantillusion,Then there's nothing incorrect in what I said
2192,ForeverInvisible,"Congratulations cherry picking a few cases. Let me tell you something. For one woman out there having a ""shit life"" (whatever that means for them), there are hundreds of average to ugly guys out there with shittier lives."

""I have no argument: the post."" Also, jfl at pretending only women can be morbidly obese. What a dumb response, a 400lb guy is just as much a landwhale. 

>maybe i should refer to you as a dog

The phrase ""men are dogs"" is literally decades old and internationally known. I guess that means most people on the planet are, according to you,  fucking disgusting and lacking manners.

>makes you feel good?

I dont really care."
2194,HowardAdderly,"There you go, you nailed it. It's about needing someone to validate you, that you're ok and worthy, so you can feel comfortable in your own skin.

I meant it‚Äôs mostly about hating myself and how I look more than it is about women. Like being alone isn‚Äôt that big of a deal, it does kinda suck sometimes, but the bigger issue is I‚Äôm ashamed of how I look


But doesn't it pop out at you that that's a mental trap that goes on forever? Like...""I fucked a 6, why can't I fuck a 9, am I not worthy? Am I not good enough?""

Because you can scrape together 50 bucks and go get a blowjob, in other words, sex is on tap anytime you want it. But that's not good enough, it doesn't provide enough validation.


I don‚Äôt want sex. I want to like myself

Even if I did it would be the last straw before suicide because the admission of being such a loser.

See in reality there's really no such thing as an incel, you can go beta bux and get a wife. But that doesn't provide the validation you want either.

You‚Äôre also 50 and I‚Äôm 23. We are from different times

Also I have a broader perspective on looks vs attractiveness. Looks is the raw material, an uncut diamond. Attractiveness is the setting, the cut, etc. So at least %60-%70 of that, we have control over it.

You can‚Äôt be fucking serious 

I can't do much about having the physique of an ogre. But I can put on a dark suit, slick back my hair and clean up well.

Ogre physique is substantially more attractive to women than tiny men who look like kids

That's Looks vs Attractiveness.

That‚Äôs you talking out of your ass and making whit up

I think most 23 year olds are KHHV.

No. I go to university and it certainly is not the norm. Heck it‚Äôs not the norm in high school either. 

But again. $50 blowjob. You can go lose that v-card anytime you want.

But I don‚Äôt want to have sex and I certainly don‚Äôt want to have it with someone who doesn‚Äôt like me. You‚Äôre paying someone to do something against their will

I don‚Äôt want a 9.5 from Hollywood. I want to look human and maybe one day have a girlfriend who is nice to me

Hollywood is fake, it's bullshit, this whole world is fake. Fake politics, fake beauty, fake money, fake security, fake countries, fake issues, fake religions, fake jobs producing fake value, fake freedom, fake democracy, you're living in the matrix buddy boy.

Yeah I know that it‚Äôs all fake. I don‚Äôt watch tv or any of that other crap

I don‚Äôt drink.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs crazy. Even IT told me being physically attractive is essential for dating 

My father was like this too. He was king chad. But he was like ""fuck these bitches, they give me a headache,"" and he would go off into the woods with his best friend, they would catch fish and cook it over a fire. No women, no nothing, ahhhh peaceful life.

I love fishing but it doesn‚Äôt fix my issues so I don‚Äôt really get your point. Before my brother left for the army we hiked into the woods and camped for a week. It was nice but it doesn‚Äôt cure anything 

You wanna become a real man someday? Have 2-3 male buddies.

I never got the girls I wanted in high school and there were always these pangs of resentment or feelings of being cheated by some universal laws of attraction I didn‚Äôt meet. I felt girls were attracted to dumb things, and I felt that it was their responsibility to change, not mine. I even spent sometime believing that, forwhatever reason, women just didn‚Äôt want me, and that I needed to learn that was ok. 

I see the pain in some incels, and I see the things they say and where their logic takes them, and I remember being at those crossroads before. Thankfully I kept choosing to be positive, and I kept working on myself, because if I went the other direction at those cross roads I could be some lonely, angry redpiller making the cringy posts that get screenshotted on IT.

""Why did you hire me to fix your sink?""  
""Because you were there and I couldn't find anyone better.""

But if you're smart you take example from other aspects of life, ie your employer hires you because he couldn't find anyone better, but if you prove yourself you can become indispensible, same thing with relationships, she doesn't know your soul from the first moment she sees you, it can take years to really KNOW a person, so you're both kind of bullshitting each other with lovey dovey words that start off rather superficial and fake, but develop into something deeper and real over a long period of time.

That's why ""fake it til you make it"" applies to nearly every situation in life, nobody is born perfectly knowledgable, sometimes you have to shitshow your way thru while reassuring the client that you know what you're doing. Same with romance, same with anything.

The reason why women seem cold-hearted sometimes is that by nature they have an abundance of romantic opportunities, this makes them seem callous, heartless, eschewing the value of individual would-be partners because in their world, would-be partners are a dime-a-dozen. In a man's world, if you find a lover, you might not find another one for months, so each relationship seems alot more vital, more important. To us it seems unthinkable to say to a woman, ""fuck off, I don't love you anymore"" but for women it's pretty standard fare because they have another potential lover around every corner."

2346,Dudley718,"Might I add my 2cents-albeit extremely late? It‚Äôs a cultural thing plain and simple. If the rappers were referring to white women(the ones listening to their music along with other demographics)as bitches, or white women believed they were the targets, it would be TOTALLY different & you‚Äôd see more scorn thrown at the industry than the minuscule amount seen today-throughout the 90‚Äôs too. An appropriate analogy would be white peoples understanding of the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word we hear so often in hip hop. We would never use it or direct it towards them(no one that I know that is)cuz it‚Äôs always offensive & meant to be derogatory; but we also recognize that they do and that it‚Äôs a TOTALLY different thing when it‚Äôs aimed at each other. Its a similar concept behind their words towards THEIR women-calling them bitches sometimes & often objectifying them-but if the women they‚Äôre talkin to/about don‚Äôt find it offensive(& perhaps even encourage or embrace it)it‚Äôs totally different as well. Not sure if that makes sense but my whole life I‚Äôve had close friends who are black and we‚Äôve discussed these things many times‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2347,uniqueeleni,"You do have a point and I am sure that the fact that they are rich, famous and attractive (for the most part) does help quite a bit. On the other hand, it‚Äôs different when they say it in a song because it is for the shock effect and the trend, they are not supposed to mean that, I imagine if they said something like that in an interview there would be an uproar.

Just like when dj Khaled when he said he doesn‚Äôt perform oral because he is a king; people really hated him for that one. Same with when metalheads sing about death, satan and murder are not actually supposed to be serial killers who worship satan, otherwise they would be in jail."
2348,HundoGuy,I don‚Äôt know. Rappers seem to like women A LOT

2353,Daniel0739,"Same here, if my mom had had me in her prime I‚Äôd probably be a Chad :/"
2354,FenrirHere,My father was 38 when he had me.
2355,Dudley718,"That‚Äôs literally NOT how genetics works at all! For starters, your mothers pregnancy was a year shy of being considered‚Äùhigh risk‚Äùmedically speaking, but even if she had you at 45 the only true risk would‚Äôve been to HER health as well as increased odds that her baby might have certain neurological defects or ‚ÄúDown‚Äôs syndrome‚Äù-all of which she would‚Äôve been tested for if pregnant after 1960‚Äôs.
So unless you do in fact have downs and that‚Äôs what u meant by blaming your looks on your mothers age rather than your unique, totally random & non age related genes/DNA passed down to you from BOTH your mother AND your fathers side of THEIR respective gene pools, you‚Äôre simply barking up the wrong genetic blame tree....and countless times looks(from attractive to average to unfortunate)are overlooked by women when the guy is genuinely confident in himself both with & without a woman-a man who doesn‚Äôt project desperation or insincerity"

**Lyrics**

***[Intro]***
Mhm, they're rotting my brain, love

These hoes are the same

*[Verse 1]*

I admit it, another ho got me finished

Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't

Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle

Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow

Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow

Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo

With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado

And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow

Who am I kiddin'?

All this jealousy and agony that I sit in

I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon

I just want real love, guess it's been a minute

Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in

Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it

Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'

Ran into the devil today, and she grinnin'


*[Pre-Chorus]*

Hey, these girls are insane, yeah (Uh)

*[Chorus]*

All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love

Think I need a change, before I go insane, love

All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love

Think I need a change, before I go insane, love


*[Verse 2]*

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes

To break my heart, oh no she didn't

Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow

Fuck givin', I'ma take not borrow

And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind

I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time

All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?

It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'


[Chorus]

Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love

Peace I can't attain, 'cause all these girls the same, love

Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love

Peace I can't attain, 'cause all these girls the same, love"

No kid's gonna murder people because he heard someone singing about it. He's more likely to treat bitches like shit though because his favorite rapper do that too.

And there's already an equivalent in rap music of the stuff you're talking about. It's the gangbanging, killing niggas shit. Everybody knows most of that is fake ass shit. But the misogyny displayed is quite real."

I can't believe people were actually sad over XXXTENTACION being shot when he was a total complete son of a bitch. He beat his pregnant GF within an inch of her life, was staunchly homophobic and had a history of assaulting his fans. The fact that there's trashy THOTs sad when he died shows that many of them don't care about misogyny, so long as it's not those ugly small dick inkwells doing it (it's wrong either way but you get the point)."

If I walked into my place of work and said ""I'm an incel!"" I highly doubt this would be the case.   


Most people are afraid of or hate incels. Most people are neutral or fine with gay people."
2401,Throwmeawayoffcliff,"Well idk what to say. I don't really do much of reading mainstream publications, media houses, and magazines. I'd think academic sources would be more reliable than other stuff anyway

As for Hollywood? I mean, looking to a capitalist thing, that exists first and foremost to gain profit, for politics isn't that great of an idea. This is in fact one of the big criticisms radical feminism has of more mainstream stuff, how capitalists will often stick a thin veneer of progressive rhetoric on stuff that ultimately isn't really that progressive at all, just to try and package something and increase its appeal and profitability. That doesn't mean that genuinely trying to be woke is bad, it just means Hollywood and capitalists in general aren't genuine about shit"
2402,Reformedgufestus,Rap is the single most misogynistic media I've ever consumed. Literally nothing is more misogynistic than rappers. Yet there's not a peep from mainstream media about it. When's BBC gonna make a documentary on it? When is CNN gonna have a prime time show about it? When will Vice and Buzzfeed and Vox have articles about it? They won't. Because they can only shit on non-mainstream people.

2404,inceltruther,"I'm not an incel I'm just here man. I'm a truther about incels, not an incel myself. Learn about the community and report back to npcs how their hatred of incels is ableist, racist, classist, and sexist. They either learn or their brains explode and both cases are fine"

2406,AmfStarBoy,And we were a legally and socially oppressed people for centuries and were often murdered. The last few years of legal progress doesn't really change that. LGBT oppression often was and still is extremely violent and trans people still have a life span in their mid-30's as a result.

Why do you think that?"
2515,Budget_Shift,"Yeah I mean I feel like I've talked about it a lot on here, the feeling of regret knowing you missed out on a lot of experiences when you were young. Knowing that guys actually want a specific girl to be with and will take the ones who are actually marriageable while abandoning the ones who aren't. Leaving the ones for us later in life as angry, emotionless and manipulative. I feel like once they go through college its too late. Ive seen too many girls get destroyed by it for several reasons. I partially blame the men for using them so much for sex and other selfish shit when in reality they don't want just that."
2516,Budget_Shift,"For two reasons, because people are, naturally, self self-serving. Obviously to different degrees, the ones who are less self serving aren't going to be around later in our life, they are going to be taken, probably since high school, and the ones that are left are the burned ones who either have a mental illness and cant feel empathy, or are so callous they don't have empathy. One of the two. The second reason is because psychopaths can read people like us, they can see that they can get a lot out of us since we have been alone for a really long time, our experiences are child like, and because of that they can take whatever they want and leave quickly. You got to keep in mind we are subhumans and for that reason won't be given mercy by the female, especially the manipulative psychopathic female population. 

Also I want to use this comment to respond to the raining fire of downvotes I received in the last comment. I thought this sub would be knowledgeable enough to understand that women follow strong men and traditionalism would fix a lot of our issues. The sexual revolution was a mistake. Most of what they do is created by strong men influential men. Why do you think they adapt and follow the rules of society so quickly? Why do you think they commonly do so well in school while boys try to go against shit all the time? Because biologically thats how they are. When you have a bunch of influential chad men whoring women out, when they have no interest in doing anything besides sex, it creates a domino effect. It starts to be seen as normal, while destroying women in the process. I could go on about this for a while but I am too tired to do so. Some day I'll write it all down but I know it will be wildly unpopular with anyone who isn't either christian or a fascist or religious in some degree."

You dont get what I mean. You are using strong as a synonym for attractive. What I mean by it is men who are the top dog in their social group, the alphas, the natural leaders, the smart physically fit guys who people listen to. The ones who create trends and push ideas that people follow. The ones women want and men want to be. Only like 10% of guys are like this, but they influence a lot of society through media and entertainment.

&#x200B;

\>How so? You mean, women having less rights than men, women being taught to follow and obey men?

More like no sex before marriage, no polygamy, no hypergamy, none of that modern bullshit that completely ruins women and lies to them telling them to become sex toys to men while also making men empty and depressed because they know their lives have no meaning banging random broads.

&#x200B;

My goal isn't to get laid, its to get with a girl who isn't going to cheat on me, or seriously fuck me over because society has ground her down so much she no longer has emotion. I would love to have a family with acres of land out in the country somewhere but I know I won't get that because women today aren't made for that, they are built up to be worker/slaves for the government and the newest product and be sex toys to the top percent of men so they can feel loved for a short minute. They have been brainwashed to want that. Living just to buy shit and screw dudes who won't call you back isn't right either, but no one cares because apparently that is their ""right"" now. They made a choice to do it, even though in a different society they could be living better lives but hey, at least its their ""choice"". Its ruining our society at large, because we no longer have things like the nuclear family or communities that come with it, we have damaged people, regions where no one knows each other, and massive gender distrust(look how popular mgtow is getting, i know several people in my life who follow it. A lot of men are scared of women and a lot of women hate men because of what they have experienced and been told). This comes from this apparently modern and accepting society. Shits breaking down, people are checking out. 

\>Or am I misunderstanding what you meant?

Those kind of girls. They‚Äôre really the vast majority.

You think 10% of men are leaders, smart, fit. All right, agreed. What percentage of the population are incels, do you think? What percentage is left, and what do those guys do? Do they have girlfriends? What kind of girls are that?"
2522,Budget_Shift,">What percentage of the population are incels, do you think?

I would reason to say about the same amount, 10% in the other direction. I feel around 70% of men have trouble dating, as in they are sleeping around with random women because they are scared to settle down or have unchecked emotional issues that just blows relationships apart, or their relationship is on a thread and they know if it fails it will be years before they can find another partner because it was sheer luck they found their current one. Theres a spectrum of normal men though, the ones who are borderline incel are probably more likely to be in relationships because they have a ""debt"" in a way that has to be paid off with a lot of work, while the borderline high value males are sleeping around. 


I would consider myself to be in the borderline incel failed normie category, which sucks because I can't really get advice or help on it. I am rejected by normal people and incels alike while at the same time realizing although my chances are slightly higher than say a full blown incel, it doesn't matter in the age of the internet. If there wasn't so much competition I, along with many others here, could probably get into healthy relationships. It just seems for us to do that we have to find a girl who is apparently just bored and wants to quickly use us because she can stomach us enough to just do that. She knows she can get better because she can and because of that feels she deserves better. I would argue 40% of this sub falls into the same category as me. Their looks are somewhat normal but they have so many character flaws they get put in the same category as incels."

My partner sucks at singing (he‚Äôs tone deaf), he‚Äôs hella short (5‚Äù3 while im 5‚Äù5), he cant play ANY instrument, he may be able to carry me for a short period of time but hes still not that physically fit, he runs slow prolly coz of his short legs lol, he is a few kg away from reaching overweight, hes SUPER blind (freaking barely see shit without his glasses. His eye grade is around 700 meaning he can only see things 2-3 feet in front of him any further is all fuzz), he isnt the smartest in his class, his course in college is probably one of the riskiest (game dev) and takes a lot of time and effort to reach a place where he‚Äôd earn a decent living for both of us,  his family isnt rich, he has a huge scar on his left arm due to a stupid accident that was entirely his fault, he has huge buck teeth that i believe a good amount of people might find a turn off, and before me he used to be a kissless no gf since birth virgin..(note: i definitely have just as long as a list of negatives but im mostly trying to point out that a nobody like him, a male nobody with low ‚ÄúSexual market value‚Äù can still find success in love)

Life didnt deal him a good hand but he still tried his best to be a good friend even to the women who friendzoned him. He‚Äôs a really reliable friend in his social circle and he has a good heart. At second year college life decided to treat him well by making me and him meet at my freshman orientation event where he is part of the higher level officers tasked to facilitate us freshmen. Despite all the rejection he had he tried his best to approach me. Before i got to know him well he looked really average..nothing eye catching about his appearance but when we met and got to know each other over two weeks of facebook chatting and discord calls...i fell in love with who he is as a person. And im glad he isnt a bitter believer of the black pill otherwise he would have probably not pursued me and i wouldnt be with him for 29 months to this day if that happened.

Yes you may seem like a loser to yourself and to most people but someone out there can see the value in you and I dont want you guys to miss such an opportunity just because youre too busy being bitter and blinded by the blackpill. Yes it has its truths that does apply to reality but not everyone can easily fall into the classifications of the blackpill because humans arent as black and white as chads, stacies and subhuman incels. Just please dont entirely lose hope just because all you experience now is failure..what if your special someone who can accept you for who you are is just around the corner and life just needs you to look up and be positive for a short time just enough to meet them and not scare them away..because it hurts me to think of the possibility of my SO rejecting me due to the AWALT ideology.

Not everyone in society is out to oppress and belittle you..some are sincerely willing to accept you in their life either as a friend or maybe even better as a life time romantic partner.

You probably need a long round of therapy to increase your personal satisfaction, and perhaps confidence, and let yourself shine more. You probably don't realise how many positive aspects of yourself are not immediately obvious to others, because you may have a constant anxiety due to negative life experiences to date. The fact that you are here on these subs at all posting as an 'incel' *may* be confirmation of that. You need therapy to learn how to be happier with the fact that you have very little control, because that's actually normal for everyone. We can only control so much, and it's a very small amount considering we're all in a much larger environment than ourselves. A lot of occurrences in life *are* down to luck.

And CBT doesn't work for everyone, it's actually got a lot of criticism for being invalidating and so making some people feel worse, especially when they have life experiences to confirm their thoughts. CBT is more for people who think in harmful ways that they do not have personal evidence to believe. In other words, if you are thinking 'No woman will ever want to be with me' because up until now all you've had is evidence of that and it's *because* of that 'evidence' that you have that thought, CBT wont help you. Another therapy, such as interpersonal therapy or even DBT if you find a therapist who will do it (some only do it for bipolar or borderline - cant remember which - but it's very helpful for a range of issues), will help you understand that past experiences do not equate to future experiences, and help you overcome anxieties your past experiences have caused in you, to improve your future attitude and prospects.

It's easier to reach a state most humans can't ever hope to reach because they don't know about it rather than competing with every other humans for females which you cannot ever get if you aren't a normie.

&#x200B;

You might say it's easier to go full autistic on meditation then to go half normie.

&#x200B;

No seriously the power of your mind is great. I thought I was pretty independant but now I'm reaching even higher levels then I thought were possible, all thanks to no fap and meditation.  Society and comparing yourself to other people is a meme. If your destiny is not getting laid then don't be sad about it and simply smile. I am part of reality and I'm done hiding. Tough luck if people want to make me feel like shit because I own who I am and nothing can change this.

I occasionally listen to criticism but I mostly don't internalize because I'm grounded in reality whereas other people are emotional and just don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

I see females and even males as what they are : Emotional beings who don't act according to logic and have such a low IQ that they usually take the stupidest decisions when it comes to love and relationships. Their love for drama, negative shit and badboy is simply incompatible with my way of thinking but it is life. I'd rather leave them alone in their own shit then try to help or be part of that.

&#x200B;

As for me being annoying LMFAO call up the mods and have them come down there and ban me, should be easy enough I have a lot of bad karmas pts from back when I was epic trolling in 2017. I give zero fucks about this and mostly write shit to help me understand my own thought processes.

&#x200B;

This subreddit is mostly a joke anyways as it's a completely negative echo chamber with people who know that they can't change shit and the odds are stacked against their very beings but rather than make do with what they have which is truly the only solution for every single human there is they'd rather whine about it.

Tough shit welcome to real life where there are winners and there are losers.

But sadly this real life is a meme. You are only a loser if you consider yourself one. If you can't own who you are then nobody will. You don't have to buy into relationships, having a GF and the normie lifestyle if you don't want to.

I would have bought into it in my grandfather time where people actually TRIED to make relationships works or back in the olds time when you could just kill a guy, steal his female, kill another guy, get a female etc until you inevitably got killed yourself. Us aspergers/incels type are caracterized by our lack of emotions which would have been extremely helpful in an extremely violent time.

Today's world is owned by highly emotionals beings, the popular Chads are getting everything and high dramas people are winning. There is no place for badasses cool headed introverts. Well there is one but it's in the shadows.

If you incels want to blame something never blame yourself because that's utterly pointless."

2606,ultimatecool14,"Mate society doesn't hate only YOU, it hates pretty much anyone with an high IQ.

It's geared to be leniant towards criminals, weaklings, degenerates and ""popular"" extroverted people. I indirectly contribute to society but it's better that I do because I keep my money to myself and don't put it into stupid shit ( yeah I know we get taxed). I would feel like shit if people had to support me. I might be an incel but I don't want my existence to be of negative value, I don't want to be a parasite, I've been so for way too long.

&#x200B;

The original incel response is ""Hoe is me this is unfair fuck all this shit snif""

A better response would be "" Well fuck them all I don't care if it's unfair that shit doesn't apply to me I will make my reality and that's all""

You should be the guy who controls himself so well he doesn't give a fuck about groups, society and what others people think of him. Read the Sigma male archetype. It fits me very well appart from the getting laid thingy. Most of us are omegas males and the highest we can aspire to is the sigma male, this is the reason why learning game and being alpha or self-improvement doesn't work for incels, we are introverted and we are not made at all to be extroverted life of the party alpha fucks.

I might be an incel but I will let nobody dictates how I should feel about myself. I don't care how many people insults me or PRAISE ME and went to befriend me. I live my life the way I want to. I interact with ""nice"" people because they are on my wavelenght and I am a nice person. No fucks are given if women go for alpha thugs, their problems not mine.

The only advice I can give you is Do nothing meditation. It's game changing. It kills off all the negative vibes/feeling you have about yourself and you become a blank human. That doesn't mean you get social skills but it means people aren't gonna attack you on sight and even if they do it doesn't really matter. Believe it or not but I actually enjoy conflict nowadays because it makes me laugh that people can lose their emotions over so little things and I laugh at their attempts to make me fit into a mold or manipulate me, I see them coming from a mile away.

People actually want to include me in their group and talk to me nowadays at work. Sadly my inceldom has forever changed me and I have lost the capability to trust in other people so concretely the change isn't big but it's definitely better. I isolate myself VOLUNTARILY rather than the opposite.

Even women notice me nowadays. You get a true ""and no fucks were given that day"" aura that isn't edgy/negative but something similar to true independance, as in this guy remains unaffected by the shitstorm or the positivity around him. He's content with himself.

Now the beauty of all this is that I might be 100 % wrong but that doesn't even matter because perception is everything. I don't see myself as a fucking loser anymore so I don't put me down and nobody actually does too.

 Never compare yourself to anybody else because it's pointless and everybody is different. If you feel better about being better than somebody then you fucking sucks. IF you feel worse than somebody else that has everything then you will feel bad about yourself. It's just all pointless."

Either ways you guys are weird, you all talk about giving up but rather than REALLY giving up and abandonning completely any thoughts of getting women you all dwell in the negativity of not getting women and it's like you are hoping to get them.

Look dudes if being an incel hurt that much than just give up. There's no point hurting yourself over something you cannot change."

2628,AlixaOathkeeper,Well he was close on drowning in the hopelessness of the black pill.
2629,AlixaOathkeeper,"How did i prove your point? I dislike the use of tinder because i despise the idea of dating someone i dont know since im a demisexual..i NEED emotional connection first before i develop an attraction. Even in social media i get NO SPECIAL TREATMENT FROM MEN because i look below average.

This is why my entire life..all the men i dated are men in my SCHOOL meaning i got to befriend and know them before i developed an attraction for them.

A best choice of woman for incels? Go for ones who arent obsessed with social media and online dating because they tend to be a lot less shallow than their counterpart."
2630,ultimatecool14,"Nobody actually likes to work and pay taxes. Look I don't get shit from society pretty similar to you.

I don't participate AT ALL outside of working. 

The black pill is truth but how incels handle that truth isn't how it should be IMO. Entitlement only works for women you can't just wish things would be some ways because if you put everything into the power of other people then it will never happens. Government can go fuck itself, it's not your friend and never will be.

&#x200B;

A lot of people know that they and we all are basically the 80 %, versus the chads and rich fucks that are the 20 

But being part of the 20 % and being a Chad isn't the recipe for happiness. All the problems you have Chad has them too except he gets laid and plays the social game/get something from society. Doesn't matter because humans are forever unhappy as a whole. Rich fucks want more money and the next big things. People are keeping up with the jonases etc. Sure we incels have so many problems and so little recognition/respect that we are literally banished from anything good coming from society but this is good because it leaves only one choice :

The point is the only person that can make your happiness is yourself. Be an happy incel, I'm 28 and I'm done with being unhappy cause I suck with women. They are what they are and I am what I am, I won't change them and I don't care anymore. Even if I'm seen as weird sometimes it's better for you to make a move and try to talk a little to people. A lot of things I thought about myself were just overthinking and people weren't actually hating me on sight, just finding me weird.

&#x200B;

Also don't worry about people talking behind your back that shit happens to everyone. If you get anything from me just get that non-directive meditation is everything. Be the guy who reaches Nirvana and once your are 100 % at peace with who you are and extremely calm people won't recoil in disgust by seeing you. People are mirroring states so if you are calm and not anxious at all people with follow your exemple and be smooth with you. Sure some of them won't but you cannot be liked by everybody. You need to be the guy who won't care about people throwing tantrums and having their periods over there, just be stone cold/smiley enthusiast and act as if doesn't matter because it truly doesn't.

&#x200B;

If I could exchange my existence with Chad thundercock I wouldn't do it because Chad wouldn't have meditation. Chad would still be affected by the small things in life and live in the blue pill world. I'd rather live in the red/black pill world and having access to the truth rather than being Chad.

2650,ultimatecool14,"Don't let your desire own you but own then.

Chad gets laid like a king but even HE can desire some women he can't get. 

for us incels it's the same thing except it's every single women. Every single minute you spend on thinking about shit you cannot have is mental masturbation. If you want to do something productive with that time do non directive meditation. It open your eyes and you start to see things you could not see before. I was too worried about pointless shit but now that I'm cool calm and collected I can even barely recognize social cues.

Get a job and leave home. My parents hated me but now they love me. That sounds impossible but seriously independance truly does something, it makes you actually care about your survival, the first months ain't easy and they are scary and also SPOILER ALERT I love my parents but they were a bunch of hyper anxious trainwrecks who stressed over literally everything 4ever and ever. No fucking wonder I grew up with epic anxiousness. Now that I barely see them once a week I'm a super chill guy that nothing pretty much fazes. I give zero fucks if people show me unrestrained hatred or even gentleness. Don't let other people dictate how you should feel. Do you own shit.

I will never be a parent but I think some part of it is that they secretly want you to ""succeed"" either because they care for you or because they want to believe that they gave birth to someone not fucked up. It's an ego thing for them, they want to think wow my son is awesome even though in reality he isn't. Normies are just dellusional like that, nobody is actually all that awesome but normies think they are. That's why they buy into lottery, they truly believe they are special and they have a 1/1000000 of winning the lottery or something. If we look at it objectively no humans is special at all. You are a doctor? cool story bro there are countless of them. You are a Chad? Meh who cares there's always a bigger Chad around the corner. You are an incel? Well cool here I can show you a venezulean incel, believe me he doesn't even have the time to care about his inceldom, too busy trying to survive.

As for opening newspaper, movies and song what the hell man that's weird. Why do you focus so much on what you can't have but so little on what you have?

You can't go and die because that's not politically correct and you can't LDAR because you will be a leech/parasite. You are not entitled to anything btw, at least not until they establish some kind of basic minimum income but I doubt it will be anytime soon.

I'd much rather pay to support incels rather than support actual human trash like criminals and degenerates or even single moms but that's not how life works. 

You are right in saying that incels have never done anything wrong and the people that we should actually punish are criminals, badboys, thugs and the people who insults incels who've never done anything to provoke them.

But that's not how the world works and it will never work that way, bullies are glorified and easily attain powerful positions. If you don't stand up for yourself nobody will, you don't have to go Elliot Rodger to make a point because the guy is fucking dead but the way to stand up is to live the life you want to life and to give the middle finger to the entire world if it needs to be done. Enough is enough. But to do that you need to meditate first and reach a state where you don't care about shit. The state I'm talking about is of epic calmness and just peace of mind. You calmly and cooly deal with anything without letting your ego dictates how you should feel. You shouldn't change your emotions because of other people."

I'd say it holds true for most depression or depressive conditions - during all the years that I was depressed to the point of being suicidal, I was convinced that it was just a part of me, and that the only difference between me and people who weren't depressed was that they couldn't see the realities of the world, and that it was my curse that I had to see it for what it was. I don't even remember the exact point that I began to question that interpretation of reality, only that I gradually began to see a choice, and that was the turning point. I realized that I could choose other attitudes and perspectives. The inherent belief that depression is an actual part of one's identity is insidious."

2660,Jeremy-Meeks,"
Pretty much a similar story here. Virginity exchange with a femcel that lived a 6¬Ω hour drive away. Originally an online relationship, that eventually mutually ended cause of distance+living in different countries, and we stayed best friends (still talk everyday for hours, sometimes with visual ""benefits""). Even took her to prom about a year ago. Basically, when it happened, we just made a deal that unless we find partners that actually live in our area that we actually like more than eachother, we'll have to restructure our life plans to eventually live together.

And well, judging by the fact I'm still an ugly manlet who's still failing left and right with girls, I'm not finding anyone any time soon. Especially someone of quality. Still not doing well with girls. She's pretty unnattractive herself, and with Pretty bad social skills (especially with guys, due to going to an all girl's HS), and is always busy, so I guess the same, even though she has a lot more hope than me due to being a girl."

2698,deep__neuron,"They achieved what they wanted. Don't you see it? This is like someone fetishizing the thought of sleeping with a black man. There's a chance they simply did it to sleep with an incel and get them out of inceldom, not actual attraction. Basically the same principle of pitty sex and they achieved the goal of pussywhipping you into the bluepill. Don't forget your past, it happened for a reason. You think the average girl would go onto Reddit, find an incel and sleep with them? They are obviously outlier weirdos. Come on, think for yourself."

I agree, women are not entirely into looks if we are talking about dating though. Still you don't have to be 5'11 nor white to ascend. I know a lot of 5'6-5'7 dudes that made it, quite easily for some of them. For most of us we haven't ascended because we are held back by our brain's defense mechanism.

No it would be stupid & disingenuous to ignore the obvious like you do. Incel tears is moral masturbation. virtue to no end but self-gratification.

Are you talking about IT or incels here? Because that entire sentence works for incels too. Me personally was a victim of all that when questioning incel ideology. I was doxxed and got death threats for asking questions.

Let me ask you this, is it reasonable to *actually* highlight anyone's negative characteristics in your opinion?

> Replace ""women"" with ""men"" and your description matches IT better than it does

That I have seen zero evidence of, but I have lived through death threats and doxxing from incels. Can you show me evidence of this?

> They have good reason in the same way a kicked dog has a good reason to bite. I simply find it counterproductive.

So you actually think me getting death threats and being doxxed is reasonable because... why exactly? 

Even comparing an incel to a dog is incredibly dumb. A kicked dog wont bite, it will whimper and cower. An incel isnt a kicked dog, it is a person who usually, in most cases never tried to approach a female, who was indoctrinated into believing all women are vile creatures, from not even 18 years of life experience. Its ridiculous. I didnt get laid until I was 25, and now I have a wife and family. I got zero attention from females before I met my wife, not getting laid isnt the end of the world.

And when someone who actually has been through that life *tries* to tell incels it gets better and not to spend their lives in a self-created hell, they lash out. Talk about females as if they're cancer with absolutely *NO* basis in reality.

I can tell you from experience, there are no ugly people. I‚Äôve never seen someone legitimately un-date-able on here.

What you're saying checks out, though. Confusion and rejection seem to correlate perfectly for must of us. Which doesn't always mean causation, but in this case, I think it is clear."
3149,Deseret_Supremacist,"Also, never to assume a girl likes you. It‚Äôs sometimes disappointing to think like this, but it‚Äôs more disappointing to be really into a girl who you think likes you, and she actually doesn‚Äôt."
3150,RyanPerson8890,"Honestly I think that's horrible advice.  A lot of women  will send mixed signals, some will hesitate due to fear of being hurt, some are shy and might worry if you like them.  Not to mention they usually don't make the first move.  Women aren't as simple as ""If they like you, they will chase after you"".  Some women will make it obvious that they like you, but that's really just their individual personality.  

I can imagine having this mindset would be very bad for self confidence because most guys don't really ever meet women that make it obvious that they like them.  It could lead to going around assuming every girl finds you unnatractive just because they don't go out of their way to talk to you or get you to like them and that's a horrible mindset to have.

If you want to know if a girl likes you, just ask her out.   There was one occasion where I was sure a girl didn't like me, I barely talked to her, but I asked her out and we ended up dating for a while."
3151,SteadfastEnd,"I wish this were true, but there have been women who liked me and I didn't realize it until a very long time had gone by.  It wasn't until they flat-out told me to my face that I realized they liked me."

3153,kamisia_benzo,"And what about men, is the feeling of confusion works the same way?"

I can also understand when one person (male *or* female) is very outgoing, chatty, inclusive, and kind- it makes it hard to not catch teeny feelings. 
Some people are just magnetic by nature (I *so* envy that gift, and you have to admit- some of the most charismatic and magnetic people in the entire fucking universe were/are *not* conventionally attractive)

3162,Budget_Shift,"I experienced it once, and yeah, its accurate. The girl who showed attraction to me didn't actually show it for several months after meeting her. She did hang around me, then a stood up for her, then she started touching more, like I remember I was talking to some of my buddies and she started scratching her hands through the back of my head, like through my hair and I slurred my words and basically just stopped talking because it was so relaxing.

3167,,"Absolutely.

All of my interactions with women will always be them being very brief and punctual in their responses. They almost never prolong the conversation or add anything to the conversation.

I can usually tell by 1-2 questions to see if she is even interested in me.

Takes like not even 15 seconds of talking to someone before you realize that she thinks you're ugly and she wants you to get away from her."
3168,fishy2525,"I'm talking to a girl via chat regularly on the phone, and she does this all the time. But I doubt it's because she's interested. She has a boyfriend already (who is tall and white btw)."

3170,celestrr,"as a woman, i wholeheartedly disagree with the first part of this. People assume I‚Äôm flirting with them all the time because of this first part.

3171,chessman6500,"That‚Äôs why men tend to find it so confusing to read the signals of women. It requires not only a mastery of non-verbal communication but it also requires paying attention. I have seen men lose chances with women who were clearly interested because they had trouble reading social cues, particularly if you‚Äôre on the spectrum. 

Certainly, if a woman is just answering stiffly then she‚Äôs not interested but if she starts getting excited, playing with her hair, asking you more detailed questions, giving you detailed answers to your questions and also making it a point to be around you then you need to ask her out. 

It does rarely happen for you guys. It‚Äôs a sham."

You don't have to change your behavior but you should know that most men aren't used to women conversing with them. Typically conversations are completely one sided. You will continuously get the same result as long as you continue to engage men in conversation. That's just how it is.

As a woman I'm not sure you understand just how little attention most men get. Men have to go out of their way to maintain connections. If we don't try our hardest to keep socializing then we will be forgotten. Only the most attractive men are the exception."

3201,the40yearoldincel,"Standards in physical looks ARE that high. I recently went on tinder and experimented myself to see if what they say about women and a man's attractiveness are true, and they are. I tried numerous times on dating apps with my own real photos, and never once got a like or match. I tried it again but with a incredibly good looking man, an easy 10+, and had the exact same profile as my real account, and I'm not kidding, literally 100+ matches and likes. I couldn't keep track. It was incredibly depressing to see that all women care about is looks, yet they continue to spew the same bullshit that confidence and personality matter more. They don't, that couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth.

Try being a 3 on the looks scale in 2019, you will get no where in life, not a good job, no friends, and absolutely no romantic relationships."

3206,chessman6500,"I think it would perhaps suck for any guy to be a 3/10 in this day and age as like you said, they may not succeed socially in any way, shape, or form. What is a good suggestion you have for the 3/10 guys to stay positive in this group, because most of them once they hear that are going to be negative, and what happens if they do meet someone despite those looks? 

I have a question, what if you are average looking, say 5 or 6 out of 10, what chances would you have to land a girlfriend and be successful in the world should this opinion be correct? 

I still think that 3s can meet someone anyways if they have the intelligence and similar interests/values to the person that they want to date, so all hope is never lost to me."

truerateme rated him at \~6 when 4.5 is average and 7 is model tier

You need to be 8/10+ to get any decent attention from women, and at least a very tall 6.5/10 to have a slight chance a woman MIGHT settle for you and give you pity sex. Even then though, the relationship won‚Äôt last. 

Women are only genuinely attracted to and will only stay loyal to types like Simon Nessman, Jorge Del Rio Romero and David Gandy. If you don‚Äôt look like them, expect a VERY difficult time finding a girl in life. You will struggle severely"
3399,Incel_Spotted,"Bruh, I would call this girl a PSL 6.5, just because she is actually so feminine and actually so cute, and she has great facial harmony.

I would call OP a PSL 4.5 facially. Also, dude is 6'0"" flat, but also is a little chubby, so that is a negative.

Overall, with the face and the height, I'd say that you could date women in the PSL 4.5-PSL5.5 dating range.

So you can date slightly above average women.

This girl is not slightly above average. She is skinny sure, but if she isn't turned into a giga-slut and birth control whore, she will be a dime by the time she is 22.

If a girl like this actually stayed somewhat modest with their sexual partners, the World would be a better place.

She is out of your league dude. 

The fact that you're only 6'0"", norwooding, and self-admitted autistic is telling me that she went with you as a friend, and you're just larping here about how she went as a date.

There's no way that a girl like this even wastes her time with an average looking dude.

I would literally give away half of my life just to spend a year with a girl like this and have her sincerely be into me. 

The sickest part of it all is that I'm taller than you, leaner than you, bigger than you, less norwooded than you, I'm not socially autistic, AND I'm still an actual incel. I'm actually shocked to see a guy with your face with a girl like this. That's why I'm coming to the conclusion that you're a failed normie, and a larper, because this girl is your friend and she agreed to go with you, or she's a co-worker and you're just taking a picture.

You mog me facially, but the rest of my body mogs you to oblivion and back. Really sucks that the face is the limiting factor for dating, and that height and body don't really have a major impact."

I can attribute it to many things, but none of which I can solely blame.

While this definitely stunted my dating life (or lack thereof) I AM very thankful that we were a close knit group and I did not have to suffer the torture that many of you have had to endure. I was a bit of a late bloomer and was much more interested in my academics and athletics than social interaction. By the time I was interested in pursuing the fairer sex, the three females I knew were not only taken, but taken by my good friends. After leaving for university at age 18, I focused 100% on my studies... I only went to a single social event (buddies birthday) during my entire 4 year tenure. Now, at 24, I have worked my way up at a corporate job that left little time for a social life.

You are not incel. IncelTears will have a field day with this, believing we're all as goodlooking as you and can't get a gf cuz we're toxic. The trouble with the incel community is it's too appealing. Men want to join it for entertainment and togetherness. I bet you will be boning your gf on Friday nights, but posting on incel forums on Saturday mornings still."

When the media sees that Chad is claiming inceldom they'll just believe incels are average dudes with body dysmorphia or any dude who can't get a relationship leaving the real incels who are sub 5  and actually ugly,actually bullied and actually discriminated against out of the spotlight and the issue won't be taken serious."

He was never in inceldom, look at him he litterally looks like the chad meme

>Yeah he may not be as much of an incel as you, or me which is a good thing imo (as if being an incel is cool or something to argue over)

Thats like when a rich person says he has no money, then posts a picture of himself infront of a new car and house and says ""Thank you for all the support & help... was able to buy a new house and car"" do you not see how that would piss off actually poor people who can barely afford food?

You have had little time to focus on your social skills but you managed to snag a date.. what should that tell you. Please don't refer to yourself as an incel. A lot of incels lost the genetic lottery and are truly ugly men that are genuinely hated by the opposite sex for existing and are only tolerated if they ""stay in line"".  When people like you come on here, you give the morons who gaslight even more ammunition that we're all just above average looking men with body dysmorphia."

Sometimes it's weird:  you'll see women with 20,000 followers (more than a lot of YouTubers) and yet they're extremely ordinary and barely post photos.

Somehow it's a loophole that Instagram tolerates.  I feel like Instagram and how influencers get paid a lot and get freebies in general is stupid as hell.  The Indian guy from Mumbai isn't going to the $500/night resort that is giving an influencer a free room - lmao."

Sorry, but the maths guy in me does not like this at all. Assuming the work place isn‚Äôt tiny one can easily take the workplace people as a representative sample and a top 10% guy in the office is likely a top 10% guy in the city.

3701,,"I mean I think we all know by this point that hot girls get lots of messages. The only new information I think we can get from this is that less attractive females are not perhaps getting as much attention as some of you thought, though 11 isn't too bad. Also that attractive guys are not fairing as well as expected. I do wonder if all the females had the same profiles and all the males had the same profiles because otherwise this data is flawed. Hope none of you get discouraged by this by the way. Dating apps are shallow and full of superficial people. Try to stay positive people!

Then again if its hard for us then it must be harder for you guys to get a relationship.

3743,,Yeah I guess women on dating sites (and in real in person interactions of course but the data doesn't prove that) are more picky. It should be noted that a lot of the matches they are getting are most likely from men who just want to have sex with them. Thats just how dating sites work and honestly they suck.
3744,,Yeah probably lol.
3745,adagioface,Brilliant point
3746,Zemedicisaspy,"That‚Äôs a solid point, but mine is that they are people out there who genuinely do not care about looks, only you‚Äôre not going to find them on dating apps, on the other hand you have more chances to find vain and superficial people. Even if we can agree that a lot of people uses dating apps it‚Äôs not 100% of the population and it‚Äôs a big mistake to think that because less attractive dudes with shitty pictures showing their triple chins have no matches, it‚Äôs useless to make an effort to improve, getting out there and meeting people in the flesh."

3756,,"Probably but honestly I would not recommended to any of my friends to find a relationship from a dating app. But yeah your right if a woman puts herself out there chances are she could find a relationship, and even a quality one if shes looking in the right places (not tinder though it has happened so im told)."
3757,lostwanderer28,With the sideferct that it will bring nothing in finding a partner. But at least one did something good for oneself.
3758,bunkjunt,Honestly I think incels are men who refuse to simp. We‚Äôre like alphas stuck in beta bodies. Men with principles stuck in a trollesque shitbag body.
3759,bunkjunt,They don‚Äôt suck for women. They don‚Äôt suck for good looking men. They only suck for average or below men. That‚Äôs literally where their money comes from...sub avg men buying premium accounts and shit.
3760,blackpilled4ever,Yeah that‚Äôs a total fucking lie there is very few women that don‚Äôt care about looks  (80/20 rule) and usually those girls are always taken. There more men than women in this work now and ppl say all kinds of stuff with false hope in dating but if you look at statistics they truly show that there is very little hope in dating for inferior males
3761,failednormie1136,"Fine, maybe a better experiment would be to track the amount of favorable responses and subsequent dates those same guys get when messaging women.

Do you honestly believe the results will portray a different picture"
3762,Yithar,"I agree. I think if I were to date, I would do it in real life. Like the thing about Tinder is that it's about how good of a picture you can take, and men are not good at taking pictures usually, including myself. I feel like Tinder and other online dating apps also gamify dating. And like there is a real person on each side."
3763,lostwanderer28,"In that case, demanding a quality message does not sound fair to me BUT if it works, who am I to judge."
3764,Yithar,"I would say I do have gripes with women, but I do see your point of view, and I agree that it is disheartening when you want a relationship and emotional intimacy and just get asked if you want to have sex and hook up.  

Personally, I think online dating isn't that great in the first place, like you said in your other comment.  
https://medium.com/indian-thoughts/why-dating-apps-are-the-place-where-single-peoples-dreams-go-to-die-a1f03d2f6add"
3765,,Exactly! Still even those guys are giving themselves away by basically reciting Noah Centineo tweets.
3766,lostwanderer28,I have no idea to be honest. I could bet that most women get invaded with offers so I couldn't be arsed either.
3767,382497234987,"Sorry sis, you don't get to complain that it's hard if you're not putting in any effort."
3768,Blubber_Whaling,Asexuals and lesbians also fuck Chad
3769,,Yeah life is pretty much a crap shoot. No one should put their self worth in their ability to get romantic relationships.
3770,,"They actually can suck for women though. My friend was assaulted by a guy from Tinder and I hear lots of stories similar to that. Personally my worst days on this planet have been because of dating sites and ill leave it at that because this isn't about me. I cant speak for good looking men but I 100% know dating apps suck for average or below men. Honestly I dont recommend them to anyone. Men because they can be demoralizing, and women because of safety issues."
3771,MrSalvos,"No, and if incels want dates they should try different tactics instead of dating websites because half of it is dependent on looks. If women know you personally before looking at you, you can get better responses. Even if you aren't ugly (although dating and friendship will be easier) because of stereotypes based on looks."
3772,,[deleted]
3773,,Yeah its a silly complaint and I am not pretending otherwise.
3774,,I know. Thats why im not complaining my singleness is 100% on me.
3775,,Well if thats happening and either groups enjoying that sex then they are not very good at being asexual/lesbians. Do you really think all women are having sex with this Chad archetype? Cause I have never had sex with a guy who fits that mold.
3776,bunkjunt,Well most girls  use them to fuck and find dudes now especially girls in their 20s. That‚Äôs like the primary way and it seems like girls are just sharing cock of good looking dudes 6/10+ dudes
3777,failednormie1136,Well unless you have a decent social circle OLD is the only option. I guess you could cold approach but jeez if you‚Äôre not attractive you have a better chance seeing Sasquatch

3783,MrSalvos,I was talking about online forums and shit.
3784,,Lmao yeah I hate arguing with people.
3785,,All humans prefer attractive partners so maybe so.
3786,Invisibleforeigner,"> But yeah if your a guy looking for a nice girl maybe avoid online dating or at least apps like Tinder.

For a lot of us it's the only way to meet women irl."
3787,bunkjunt,"you're missing the point. most girls use it now to meet men for short term and LTR (girls in their 20s, which is the age range of most incels). the problem is there is no way to meet girls anymore. most girls are getting hit up by hunks on OLD apps, instagram DMs, etc, so for a guy who's about average, you can't just go out and approach girls; you're competing with not only other dudes IRL, but dudes hitting her up on apps and facebook and instagram. how could any dude south of average compete?"
3788,lostwanderer28,Hehe understandable :) I don't like it much either.
3789,Blubber_Whaling,"Yes, except men find all types of females attractive. The reverse cannot definitely be said otherwise we would not see the results in the OP"
3790,,That makes sense. Maybe try plenty of fish though. Tinder is 90% attractive guys trying to hookup and attractive girls trying to get free food.
3791,,Your probably right. Im speaking from the perspective of someone who does like being approached and doesn't have dating apps or Instagram anymore so I guess I wouldn't have though of that.
3792,,Yeah women are more choosy when it comes to picking partners. Most likely because women are usually unconsciously looking at things long term and they want their kids to have the best possible traits. I dont think most of the men responding to any of the women are thinking about if the woman would make a good mom so thats probably why we all have more options. Im not saying thats fair of course. Its sad for the men who women ignore based on these superficial traits.

My current boyfriend has never shed a tear in his entire life and has 2 rape charges, buuuut have you considered it's obviously your personality and looks don't matter (he's 6'3 btw, I'm letting you know for no reason btw) and that you should probably go to therapy and cry. Also, I saw a guy on TV who was ugly and had a woman, so you absolutely cannot blame genetics. Just be the main actor of game of thrones and stop crying about genetics? It's almost as if yada

Edit: Just turned on my tv again. Apparently kevin hart has a girlfriend and he's short. So what's your excuse, incel? I bet you have a small penis too. Oh, it's a conversation about penis size now? Well guess what incel, penis size doesn't matter now that the conversation is about it, and it's more about you being a bad person in bed now. 

Edit 2: So you went to therapy and are communicating fully and doing everything above average? Well, for starters, it's not genetics. Even though every animal species on earth is based completely on genetics, YOU are the exception and YOU are a bad person and I am gaslighting you."

If a conservative did that, they'd be off the platform forever.

3904,sunsetblvd03,"various ways in which women face discrimination and oppression worldwide:

women in saudi arabia only recently were allowed to drive. they only got the right to vote in 2015. 

vastly more women are sex trafficked than men. it's an epidemic. that thousands of teenage girls are trafficked for sex, and even more being vulnerable to sex trafficking, shows we're nowhere near equality. not in the way women are treated.

in dubai, a man must sign an agreement in order to let his wife drive herself.

within the catholic church, women cannot become bishops or priests. they're not considered competent enough.

in 32 different countries, women can only get a passport if their husband gives permission.

russia's gender equality legislation, which prohibits discrimination based on gender/sex, has been pending for 13 years.

in countries such as saudi arabia and morocco, a woman can be punished for leaving the house without a male companion, or for being alone with an unrelated man.

cyntoia brown, a woman who was sex trafficked since she was a child, and was sentenced for 51 years for killing her sex trafficker. this sex trafficker had threatened her, beat her, and raped her since she was a child. and she was sentenced to 51 years.

over 80% of american women have experienced sexual harassment: https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/21/587671849/a-new-survey-finds-eighty-percent-of-women-have-experienced-sexual-harassment

If a content don't have a big number of views and it's controversial (like lamost everything political), a small amount of people can, by reporting it in a short span of time, trigger a response of the mods (automated or not).

Okay, women are trafficked for sex more often. Men are generally the victim of violence more often. We can look at all kinds of data, but it's at LEAST equal, NOT favoring men like you claim.

Notice I'm the Nordic countries where ""equality"" has been ""achieved"" (whatever that means), the disparities we see actually WIDEN when it comes to choice of profession and things like that.

This doesn't even remotely touch on how courts favor women and give them less of a sentence for the same crime. This is undisputed. Not to mention women always being the first choice for child custody in the courts. 

Every piece of evidence you can cite, I've heard before, and could respond with two pieces to go against it. It's not an argument you can win. And what we're really talking about are governmental and even social obstacles, not a few psychopaths kidnapping women. That has zero to do with equality of opportunity so to speak. 

I can name one legal right women have that men dont. And that should be more than enough. Women can vote in America without having to sign up for Selective Service (the draft). Men cannot, and are required by law to put themselves on a list to potentially have to go to war. One of our most basic aspects of society has a penalty for men to use it. Remember this: Women got the right to vote without having to worry about such a penalty. No, but legal systems favor men, right? Complete nonsense.

Still think things favor men? That's not to say women don't face any obstacles or any of that. But to suggest that society in general favors women when they're always given the benefit of the doubt, both in social situations and in our legal system (and legal systems around the world who are NOT Saudi Arabia or other hellholes). If that doesn't at least present concerns for you, then I think you've either been duped, or are intellectually dishonest.

The feeling of the right with Trump and Brexit isn't that. The right has now the same view, and has no remorse in calling for the rape and murder of a minior or saying that half of a country are traitors.

3941,BlackHeart357,"All true, but when we talk about the ""penalties"" of the vote for men, also keep in mind that many women back in the day didn't even necessarily WANT the right. The idea was that men had certain societal responsibilities that would give them the right. For example, hue and cry, basically a mandatory requirement to intervene in defense of someone being victimized, or even in chasing down a perpetrator. You'd have to literally run out of your house to do so or potentially face penalty.

Women saw this and were skeptical, but this was way before 1920. By that time, a lot of those requirements for men were antiquated and not as much of an issue, but had women gotten the right to vote in let's say, 1880, they may very well have gotten the right without those penalties.

The Selective Service Act and who passed it is irrelevant. It still requires us to sign up to use our right to vote. Whether it was passed by men, women, or unicorns, it's still a right that women have without the same penalty as men. There's no dancing around that fact. That still doesn't disprove my original argument. In fact, in only PROVES that we psychologically favor women. A man, volunteered other men to have to sign up for the draft, and excluded women from that. Likely not because of sexism, but to protect women in a sense. Suppose Hugh S. Johnson had tried to include women in the Selective Service Act. He'd have likely been tarred and feathered and raked through the coals. ""How could you expect women to have to sign up for military service!?""

I'm 1,000,000% for equality. But that equality has to actually BE equality, rather than like a buffet where women can take the benefits in certain situations, and get rid of the downsides at the same time. That's not equality. You know it, and I know it."
3942,WikiTextBot,"**Conscription**

Conscription, sometimes called the draft, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1‚Äì8 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force.

On the automated system, yes, you're right, but often there's no explanation given upon appeal, or no appeal at all. For example, take YouTube. I have a good few handfuls of videos up. One specific video, despite breaking no rules on content or monetization, was demonetized. No explanation, and no way to appeal. Love or hate Steven Crowder, he had the same treatment. Broke no guidelines, removed videos that were maybe dancing on the line of breaking rules, and still had his entire channel demonetized. That's a whole other issue, but it's besides the point. At some point, humans step in, and make those decisions. Ironically, Google is extremely willing to hide LGBT videos in Saudi Arabia for example. 

And the right doesn't think the body is sacred? What, you're referring to the abortion issue? Yes, because the right does not believe that a fetus is ""part"" of the woman's body, and therefore cannot just be aborted. That it has at least some rights of its own. They don't disagree with what you said, just see that one SPECIFIC issue as not being ""their own body"". Even if you disagree in principle, it's disingenuous to not understand that position on at least some level, just like I understand the left's position on this, even if I disagree.

That also requires the presupposition that incels demand a ""right"" to women's bodies. That's a twisted and corrupted representation of what the average incel believes, including myself. We simply want to be able to find a romantic partner. You know, a basic need that is built into us. And so when we feel like shit when we can't find someone, we're ""entitled"", and ""want to control women's bodies""? No, that's nonsense. I'm not saying there aren't psychos in incel circles that want forced marriages and shit like that, but that isn't even close to a majority of us. Certainly not in a place like this subreddit. 

On universal healthcare, I mean sure, but I can only base it on being in the U.S., so that's a wash.

On IT being consistent: Look at it this way. The left sees EVERY inequality as being an issue, largely relating to economics. So racism let's say, would be a core issue, but that would be what leads to economic disparities for minorities in America, right? So it comes down to economics one way or the other.

Now, I disagree with the left on tax policy and this sort of redistributionist mindset, but I do understand it. ""People with exhorbitant wealth should pay more, so that people at the bottom who are left behind can be okay and survive"" more or less.

But then you go to the ""economics"" of the ""sexual marketplace"", where their rules suddenly change. ""Oh, that guy at the top who has banged 1,000 women, while the guy at the bottom can't find anyone, has no friends and is suicidal? Yeah no, both of those people deserve to be in that position.""

No, it's the exact opposite of left-leaning ideas. In fact, it's not conservative either. Because at least conservatives see a rich person, especially one who started from nothing, as ""the guy who had to invest, took all the risk, had to make it all happen, and now he's being handsomly compensated for that"", whereas in the sexual marketplace, being born with good looks is completely unearned. Kind of the equivalent of someone being born into a family worth a billion dollars and bragging about ""how rich they are"". Like no, you didn't earn that. I'm not looking to take it away from you since I'm conservative and don't believe in that, but to say ""I earned it"" would be an outright lie, just as it would be a lie to say the struggling janitor who busts his ass for his family 60 hours per week ""deserves"" to be where he is. I'm not saying to steal the other guy's money to give to the janitor, but just that the game itself is often just fucked up. That's my broader argument on ""the sexual marketplace"". And no, I don't normally call it that, just responding to you framing it as an economic issue.

IT's response to the struggling janitor is ""stop whining, fucking pauper. You deserve to be poor. Must be your personality."""

Incels need to wake up that Trump and his gang (Bannon, Miller, etc.) have no interest in helping us.  I have no doubt Trump, like my brother, would laugh at us if he could get away with it (and he probably would).  Trump's campaigns have no policies that are designed to help incels.  The bans on biomedical research (to appease the anti-abortionists) ensure disabled incels never get any research for cures.  Trump just wants to amplify misogyny to point at political opponents (Hillary, Elizabeth Warren, etc.) and unfortunately due to the horrific treatment incels endured at the hands of many women, they become vulnerable to that.

You're a moderator. You are supposed to be able to see bad posts. What does it say about your moderating skills if you claim that you've never spotted the ""men are trash"" messages on that subreddit?"

>On Trump and Brexit, I think to really understand the right, you have to look to people like Ben Shapiro, Dinesh D'Souza, the list goes on, to actually understand true conservatism, rather than looking at the active psychos on Twitter on both sides who yell about each other being evil.

That doesn't work, beign neutral isn't an excuse.

See It the ame way germans see nazism: if there is a nazi in a table and other nine don't leave inmediately, there are ten nazis in the table.

This is the metric for everything: Shapiro does spit in the face of those pychos or tolerate them while they vote the same as him?

Or, in the incel communities: do crazy people get downvoted into oblivion and banned inmediately or they're tolerated?

The right don't understand that concept, and put a surprised pikachu face when they're remended about the things that they let exist within their flag.

>On the automated system, yes, you're right, but often there's no explanation given upon appeal, or no appeal at all. For example, take YouTube. I have a good few handfuls of videos up. One specific video, despite breaking no rules on content or monetization, was demonetized. No explanation, and no way to appeal. Love or hate Steven Crowder, he had the same treatment. Broke no guidelines, removed videos that were maybe dancing on the line of breaking rules, and still had his entire channel demonetized. That's a whole other issue, but it's besides the point. At some point, humans step in, and make those decisions. Ironically, Google is extremely willing to hide LGBT videos in Saudi Arabia for example. 

Money. That's the religion and mantra of every company. What does give them more money? They'll act accordingly.

>And the right doesn't think the body is sacred? What, you're referring to the abortion issue? Yes, because the right does not believe that a fetus is ""part"" of the woman's body, and therefore cannot just be aborted. That it has at least some rights of its own. They don't disagree with what you said, just see that one SPECIFIC issue as not being ""their own body"". Even if you disagree in principle, it's disingenuous to not understand that position on at least some level, just like I understand the left's position on this, even if I disagree.

The right puts the Life of the unborn before of everything, even if It destroy's the mother's life.

>That also requires the presupposition that incels demand a ""right"" to women's bodies. That's a twisted and corrupted representation of what the average incel believes, including myself. We simply want to be able to find a romantic partner. You know, a basic need that is built into us. And so when we feel like shit when we can't find someone, we're ""entitled"", and ""want to control women's bodies""? No, that's nonsense. I'm not saying there aren't psychos in incel circles that want forced marriages and shit like that, but that isn't even close to a majority of us. Certainly not in a place like this subreddit. 

Having a partner isn't a basic need. You don't need for not having intimacy.

And everybody wants that, the issue begins when people find excuses and don't accept that the problem are themselves.

>On IT being consistent: Look at it this way. The left sees EVERY inequality as being an issue, largely relating to economics. So racism let's say, would be a core issue, but that would be what leads to economic disparities for minorities in America, right? So it comes down to economics one way or the other.

>Now, I disagree with the left on tax policy and this sort of redistributionist mindset, but I do understand it. ""People with exhorbitant wealth should pay more, so that people at the bottom who are left behind can be okay and survive"" more or less.

>But then you go to the ""economics"" of the ""sexual marketplace"", where their rules suddenly change. ""Oh, that guy at the top who has banged 1,000 women, while the guy at the bottom can't find anyone, has no friends and is suicidal? Yeah no, both of those people deserve to be in that position.""

Sex and intimacy have a unique characteristic over anything monetary: you can't create intimacy without having it beign taken from other human, so that changes the rules.

>No, it's the exact opposite of left-leaning ideas. In fact, it's not conservative either. Because at least conservatives see a rich person, especially one who started from nothing, as ""the guy who had to invest, took all the risk, had to make it all happen, and now he's being handsomly compensated for that"", whereas in the sexual marketplace, being born with good looks is completely unearned. Kind of the equivalent of someone being born into a family worth a billion dollars and bragging about ""how rich they are"". Like no, you didn't earn that. I'm not looking to take it away from you since I'm conservative and don't believe in that, but to say ""I earned it"" would be an outright lie, just as it would be a lie to say the struggling janitor who busts his ass for his family 60 hours per week ""deserves"" to be where he is. I'm not saying to steal the other guy's money to give to the janitor, but just that the game itself is often just fucked up. That's my broader argument on ""the sexual marketplace"". And no, I don't normally call it that, just responding to you framing it as an economic issue.

Money and intimacy can't be compared, nor fall under the same rules.

>IT's response to the struggling janitor is ""stop whining, fucking pauper. You deserve to be poor. Must be your personality.""

There is no other answer. Intimacy is freely given or violently taken, there is no middlle ground."

3953,BlackHeart357,"On first point... Sure, I guess that's true.

Second, also sure, I'll grant that. But are you really saying that men would also be in a position to have it easy to report sexual assault and things like that? No, it's typically either minimized, or even laughed off.

No matter which way you go with this, there's tons of counter-evidence.

At the end of the day, there is no inequality in law, and in many cases it favors women, and *maybe* in some cases it favors men, but even that is questionable. Yet I can immediately cite several examples of ways that the legal system is stacked against men. 

But for people to be out in the streets screaming for ""equality"" when they can't point to a single area where men and women are unequal and then look to more social issues.. Like, what do you expect anyone to do..?

""Men don't respect me at work!"" - Very well may be. But you can't exactly legislate that. ""Listen to that woman's opinion. At gunpoint.""

""The wage gap!!"" - Different job choices, and job choices that still exist in place like Sweden, where ""equality"" has been achieved. In fact, the gap in those choices WIDENED.

""Women do more unpaid labor!"" - Probably true, but that's between you and your partner. The government isn't going to pay you for cleaning your own house...

These are more social-type issues. What pisses me off is that women conflate this with legal issues as if law, in and of itself is the cause.

And then a further irony is that women want to be equal to men, and when they're suddenly making good money, now they think all men are below them because they demand to be able to date up. It's all a clown show."
3954,Fakercel,"Women got significantly increased rights around the same time, contraception and tampons were invented.

You can't just choose to ignore these facts, there are real reasons women have had less power through history.

People in general had less resources so education, power and responsibility was focused on men, whereas ensuring our future generations was given to women.

It wasn't really possible the other way around, if education and power was given to women, they would have been inhibited when getting pregnant or having periods during critical moments of their career. And men wouldn't have been better on their own at ensuring future children as they cannot produce them on their own.

Plus many women have strong biological tendencies to want to spend time with their children still seen today.

All throughout history men have been the variance aspect of evolution, high risk high reward. Men have more mutations and are more disposable than women, nearly every women who has stayed alive throughout history has passed on their genetics, whereas literally half of men to have ever existed never passed on their genes."

3957,BlackHeart357,"First, let's get rid of the idea that fascism is on the right. It has absolutely zero basis in reality. You know who are also racist? Dixiecrats. I used to know this guy who ran for rep of our district. He lost by basically a handful of votes. Lifelong Democrat. Every other word out of his mouth in Private is the n word. Both sides tolerate complete scumbags when it benefits them, let's be perfectly clear.

Next, I know you're going to claim that guys like Richard Spencer are conservative. They're not. That's not me trying to disavow. No, they don't have conservative principles. He believes rights come from the government, completely again our founding principles of natural rights. And other nonsense to the effect of, ""Socialism would work! If it weren't for the Jews and Blacks..."" These assholes love leftist policy. When it benefits white people. Literally ZERO conservatism about that.

Besides, we don't tolerate them. How many fucking times does it take for someone to disavow another person for them to be believed? It's complete nonsense. 

On abortion, yes, but you have to at least on some level understand giving a voice to the unborn child as well, even if you disagree with the position. Like I said, I fully understand the liberal argument on abortion. I just disagree with it. But you seem incapable of that same understanding.

I see what you're saying about sex and monetary transactions needing different rules, but they're not completely disconnected either. There's still an economy to both.

You still seem to want to believe that I think I have a right to women's bodies. You're just hoping in your bones that it's what I believe. Guess what? I don't believe that, like it or not. You might have to deal with the absolute horror that you don't know what you're talking about on either conservatism or incels.

And yes. Absolutely 1000% yes, finding a partner is a basic need. How do I know? Look at most people who were never able to. They're miserable. I should also note that some data suggests that men benefit disproportionately from an emotional standpoint from finding a parnet. Until you understand what it's like being alone, I suggest you not give an opinion on that aspect of life. You clearly can't relate. Can you really say that you could be alone for the next 60 years? No friends? No girlfriend? No sex? We're social animals, of course you couldnt. It would make anyone insane."

You can say ""I have never seen any message on that subreddit that states men are trash"" or conversely you can say ""I confirm I am aware of those messages on the subreddit"".

3960,,it's over
3961,AbysmalDescent,"Personally, it's the staggering amount of ignorance, misinformation and slander against braincel, from mainstream reddit, that is most troubling. There are far too many people who actually think it was some kind of terrorist group or that it was just there to teach kids to hate women, or calling on men to go attack/harm women. It's insane. Braincels was none of those things, and actually seemed fairly diverse.  There are a lot of social systematic issues in this world, and on reddit, and braincels was a place that brought light and hilarity to those problems. Despite all the memes and over-the-top sensationalism, it was also often the most truthful and honest approach to a lot of these issues, which also brought a lot of joy and comfort to a lot of disenfranchised men.   

This is a perfect example of how fear-mongering can be very effective in certain situations, and how majorities in power can be so indoctrinated and corrupt, even with the best of intentions, or even be hateful bigots when it suits them(which also makes them hypocrites). There are so many other hateful and sexist communities on reddit that will never be touched by these new modding policies(srs, inceltears, twoxc, most femcel subs, etc) and so many other misandric majorities, which are all over reddit, who will just feel empowered by stuff like this. 

The worse part of it all is just how fundamentally committed mainstream reddit seem to be about a declining status quo. How woefully unprepared they are to address, or even properly identify/assess major systematic issues. It's just sad. They will even pat themselves on the back thinking ""job well done"" when really they aren't really doing any good(and I'm sure they will use whatever means they can to try to justify their actions, true or false). At best, they are being little more than a hindrance and establishing a very clear partiality.  At worse, they are silencing people because they are afraid of what they have to say."

There‚Äôs no doubt that people will be hurt now that the site is banned, especially those that dedicated a lot of times to producing the memes and other content.
