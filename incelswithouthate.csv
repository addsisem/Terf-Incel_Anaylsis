63,Do you have Aspergers op?
64,"YESSS love it. This should be archived as evidence for the possibility to ascend.

Also, you're a good looking dude, OP. Just a bit overweight and not the best grooming for conventional attractiveness."
65,"I can only offer anecdotal evidence here, but in my experience aspies are definitely more likely to care about personality than appearance. We can come off as insensitive at a glance (in my case, when I say something without thinking about how it will be received), but we're actually more caring and empathetic than most.

Incel wasn't a popular (compared to now) term for my teen/college years, but my boyfriend says he definitely would have identified with the community if it existed before he met me. I was attracted initially to his sense of humor and obvious intelligence, and we've been together happily for 11 years as of August.

I wish the best for you, OP, and hope you find the same happiness with your lovely girlfriend that my boyfriend and I found together!"

80,"Dude, congrats on building a better life but having a girlfriend isn't a cure-all for the things that haven't been right. Enjoy her, love her hard if y'all get to that point, but you gotta be getting better everyday. Stagnating in the pool of her beauty and effervescent vibes won't get you far and she'll prolly get bored. Stay active looking your own life. Allow her to be your biggest fan, get glimpses of you being a rockstar, and let her help you as much as you allow. Keep striving for the best you and enjoy/cherish anytime you're around her."

178,"\> Isn‚Äôt it obvious enough that if you‚Äôre at least 18 years old and still a virgin that it‚Äôs because most women find you repulsive and that you‚Äôre a confirmed incel?

My brother and most his friends didn't even start dating until 20-21. Later parts of college when they're stable with their career (got good internships or an offer out of college). He did nothing except play video games with his friends throughout high school and was too busy trying to secure employment out of school early parts of college, and then suddenly got interested in girls after all that. I would say looks wise he's above average but still within normie range. He's VERY sweet and gentlemanly though. Like we used to role play pokemon and he would always let me be the stronger / type advantage pokemon so I can win and be happy, and he's my LITTLE brother so if anything I would be letting him win. 

I had problems dating because I'm very asocial and avoidant, but normal people like my brother and friends find relationships very naturally. Similarly it's much easier for him to walk into a social event or party and come out of it with new friends, while it's very hard for me to just make friends from one interaction."

181,"Honestly neither one of you are wrong on this.

Earlier this year I read a study (I forget from where) on sex & it said 1/3 of people (or at least Americans) under 30 have never had sex (males 31% females 28%)

I believe the reason it‚Äôs skyrocketing is because of modern day American culture (ie the weird social alliance between Christian evangelicals & SJWs) mixed with a terrible economy"
182,Your IQ must be too low then.
183,"I honestly think it has to do with the fact that we have a ton of more entertainment. We're not bored enough to desperately want to pair up and make kids. Relationships and kids are hard, there are a ton of entertainment that's easier to get and less stressful. It's much easier and simpler to spend a night playing my favorite video game than a first date. At the same time, stuff that's harder to get is more fulfilling and eventually might lead to more. But often we don't realize that, or the pain doesn't get as bad until we're older and got tired of cheap entertainment. 

I say this because I get into a lot of discussions with my parents/grandparents since I was single for so long, and they said when they were my age they really had nothing else to do other than start a family. Even job wise things were simple, they got a job and just kept working at it and they're promoted mostly based on seniority."

186,"Not a bad effort. Most of this reduces to things that have been posted by normies on incel communities many times before, but I do like that you were so honest here:

>Meeting people is just a matter of odds.

The IT will hate this truth the most, because it destroys their ability to weaponize accusations of ""bad personality."" In fact, if they were able to grasp this and follow it to its conclusion, they would apologize to us and shut down their sub immediately. (If you start getting racist private messages from sock puppet accounts, it's from IT users.)

Also some advice for your advice: Don't make the 'ball rolling' part so dependent on alcohol because many here are on psychiatric medications that interact severely with alcohol, and inviting someone to go drink alcohol and then proceeding to not drink alcohol yourself is potentially problematic in many ways."
187,">**You don't go fishing to catch fish**,

I can get behind this however,

&#x200B;

> **don't talk to people only because you want something from them**. 

People have agendas, wants and needs. It's just part of human behaviour (selfishness, cynicism). And some people just are not that sociable to get pleasure out of talking to people and being friendly for it's own sake. So you're saying don't talk to people because you have some kind of intention (like to build up your social network, meet more women and that kind of thing) but realistically you can't quash the desire. It's going to be there.

&#x200B;

>**Don't try to impress people**. 

Again, this isn't something that necessarily works in a superficial society. People form first impressions about people all the time based on how you walk and talk, how you present yourself, what kind of job you have. People who are purely superficial are just as rare as people who purely judge others based only on what's inside. Most people are somewhere inbetween those two extremes, so realistically you need to have a blendure of traits that will appeal to both personality types. You talk about ""things that worked for me"" but realistically, you are probably neglecting to talk about ***other*** things that might have worked for you like going to the gym, focussing on your career, focussing on the way you walk, talk and present yourself, improving your looks and style, those kinds of more materialistic qualities.

&#x200B;

>**Meeting people is just a matter of odds** 

Luck plays a role but it is by no means the only important factor. People tend to form cliques and put up social barriers against lone wolves, introverts, shy types and folks with mental health issues or physical defects. That is a barrier that has to be overcome and it is not purely accomplished by going out more which can help but is also a double edged sword (more on this).

&#x200B;

>**""Hey, wanna grab a beer this week?""** 

I understand this has to be contextualised, e.g. in a conversation where you have already built rapport with someone. But if we take this at face value alone, it's not really a suggestion that brings much value. My one is ""would you like to get a coffee some time"" but I use it mostly because I can't think of anything better. I mean there is a world of interesting and fun activities like tennis, salsa, restaurants, theatres and so on. Is getting a drink really the only suggestion you can make to someone? How are you going to make your invitation sound appealing? This person is going to spend time with you so they want to know they will get value rather than just having value leeched off them. How are you going to build up to this kind of invitation? What ways can you be innovative and sound interesting? Just asking people out to drinks is something that more often than not will get a ""sorry but I'm busy this week, maybe some other time though"" type of response. Like I said, I use it but I don't think it should be presented as the optimal strategy at all.

&#x200B;

>*Take yourself on dates*

This is something that is a double edged sword.  Doing this you can build up a foundation for engaging in interesting activities and being an interesting person but you can also be seen as ""that guy"" who's always by himself when you go to these places where hopefully you will also be interested in building up a basis for networking.

&#x200B;

>Being a well-rounded human being is crucial to a good conversation. TV and video games give you very little to talk about. 

Ok, yes I can't disagree with this one. But being good at conversation requires more than just having a wide array of interests. You will need to be good at wit which requires abstract logic. You will need other psychological skills that involve shifting conversations towards subjects you are good at discussing, introducing fascinating anecdotes and in general just being good at improvisation. So having interests is definitely one component of being a good conversationalist but it undermines what actually goes into the art as a whole.

&#x200B;

>It's fine to ask for a glass of water, to say ""dude, that was mean"" or ""please stop interrupting me"". 

Sure but people who do this can also have difficulties socialising. In fact it can come across as an anal, highly  strung-out personality type if you do it all the time. Which is often what happens when guys listen to too much PUA and self-improvement related stuff.

&#x200B;

>*No More Mr Nice Guy*. Every incel should read this book. It really helped me spin things around and realize *I* was being manipulative. 

This is something that makes me sad to hear. Guys can have be non-manipulative and have genuinely good traits but suffer socially and with women regardless. Talking about and complaining of issues you have ***in spite of*** genuinely good traits is something that is often mischaracterised as something that must be non-assertive as well as manipulative which is totally not necessarily the case at all. The *No More Mr Nice Guy* book began a very bad stereotype about ""nice guys"" as manipulative, validation seeking and non-assertive which wasn't fair at all. And it is often recommended as a ""go to resource"" now for men who struggle with women, socialising or other areas in life, where the assumption tends to be that if you struggle in these areas you must be manipulative, validation seeking and non-assertive. Very unhelpful.

&#x200B;

> *How to win friends and influence people*. It's just a great manual on how to deal with other human beings 

I'm sorry but it is not. It is a great manual on how to be a socially subservient ""Yes Man"". In the book Carnegie literally recommends never criticising people or only indirectly so, which does not account for situations where a person may be engaging in destructive behaviour that is potentially dangerous. This is just an example. He also says ""never argue"" or try to prove your right which again doesn't account for many nuanced situations where you may well need to demonstrate correctness if another person is going to engage in potentially foolish behaviour that may harm himself, others or you. There are more instances of passive behaviour and cheesy/forced positivity stuff that really is not particularly helpful at all in that book.

&#x200B;

>*The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F\*\*k*. Optional read. The first chapter (which is free) should be enough. It gets repetitive after that.

I haven't read it. But life requires that people ""give a fuck"".

&#x200B;

My friend's gf once told me she gravitates toward me in social situations bc I make her feel safe (weird thing to say but still cool). I have a really wide set of interests which allow me to go talk Russian history with the nerds in my office, interpersonal drama with the old ladies, share stories with the sales people, and business with the managers.

This is the best list of advice for incels I've ever seen, and I agree with every point on here. Not sure if you've already come across this, but I would focus on trying to emmulate this as much as possible. Basically, stop living in your own head thinking it's impossible to make connections, and focus on being happy with yourself first and foremost. Once you accomplish that, the rest will literally fall into place without much effort. Making lasting connections, platonicaly and romantically, starts with you building love for yourself. Without that, you will continue to fail. "

So just try to fake all of this stuff the best you can until you can get a gf (who doesn't have to be attractive, or have much in common with you, but should be kind). This is one of those things where sex/a girlfriend really is the solution, at least IME."

As a gay dude, who had far to many girls interested in him before he came out of the closet, 3 factors that were huge

I was busy - I had a fucking life, I didn't have time for girls, and that makes you, and your time more valuable. And this isnt a ""fake being busy thing"", this was a I was living my life, doing my best to do things that made me happy.

I wasn't interested - I wanted to do things with people because I wanted to do those things, play Catan, go swimming, go for a road trip, go to an amusement park, and I would always go as a group, and there would always be some girl trying to get my attention

I was happy - One of the most attractive quality's in someone, is that they are happy without you, they dont need you, they are living their best life

&#x200B;

Stop thinking about women, stop trying to chase them, do shit that makes you happy, and I mean genuinely happy, not I played 13 hours of video games happy. Find a ""stretch"" activity aka something outside of your comfort zone and do it. You all know something you want to do, (gym? A party or event? A road trip? A vacation? School? A course? A therapist?) just get started, even if that means its just finding the details out of how to begin."

223,"An excellent post and thanks for your time to post it. 

I'm 'guilty as charged' when it comes to trying to impress other people and I know that's wrong. Only a few days ago I come across a picture with the caption 'stop wondering if I'm good enough for other people and start wondering if they're good enough for me'. It something I'm going to actively try to manage this year. Naturally, as someone at the bottom of the social ladder, this is easier said than done. 

Fortunately, I've already learnt how to be alone. I do genuinely like my own company at least 90% of the time. I'd be lying if I said I was happy all the time at being alone... However, I do appreciate my own company more than being with acquaintances who I know back-stab me. "
224,"The advice on how to be alone is especially great. I'd add that being lonely sometimes is normal, but you can't expect another person to take away your discontent with yourself. "

Even when it‚Äôs a social encounter that shouldn‚Äôt produce a hookup or a magical GF on the spot, that lingering feeling still exists‚Äîsomething that should be the last thing you think about. "

I lack self-confidence and many things, and I never had a partner yet, but after respecting myself and focusing on my own interests, this stopped bothering me, and I started having a better time with people without seeing them as potential partners, honestly."

250,"Nice criticizm but i think you only mention the bad sides here, in my opinion the bad possibilities to all these suggestions is maybe at most in the 30% range whilst possible good outcomes must be at 70%. For example; when dating yourself, a few people might be freaked out. Meanwhile, you're increasing your happiness AND some people who observe you sre actually inspired and/or tempted to approach you because being comfortable by yourself gives a really good impression on people. People may feel safe to talk to you about the book you're reading or whatever else you might be doing.

I'm also all for the ""no more mr. Niceguy"" as i believe almost everyone who struggle enough with women to be labeled an incel gives people the impression of being selfish and manipulative even if they don't know it or don't intend it. You can be the nicest guy in the world and still give people the wrong idea.

251,"How to win friends and influence people is one of the worst meme in the history of self improvement.

I've read the book and idolated it for years, applying everything I could in it.

Results : Still no friends and still Incel. This could have potentially worked back when society was more principled and when being good was a virtue but nowadays it's a joke. You are painting a target on your back by being a nice guy."
252,"> People have agendas, wants and needs. It's just part of human behaviour (selfishness, cynicism). And some people just are not that sociable to get pleasure out of talking to people and being friendly for it's own sake. So you're saying don't talk to people because you have some kind of intention (like to build up your social network, meet more women and that kind of thing) but realistically you can't quash the desire. It's going to be there.

You could always try a different sort of agenda. Like being motivated to talk to people in order to improve your social skills and gain some confidence. Like practice approaching people, and attempt to have interesting conversations. Try to get good at it. That way even if it goes nowhere, you've still gained something, and you don't feel like it's been a waste of time or whatever."

As a rule of thumb, if you keep a mental note of their ""balance"", you're probably not doing it out of kindness. I can think of that guy my mom dated for a while. He showered her with gifts, and when they broke up, he just about sent her a bill for it. He wasn't kind, he was trying to buy her affection. It wasn't a genuine gesture of affection, just ""insert coin, get love"".

257,"Manipulative means to try to make people act and feel in certain ways. When expecting something from someone, it's a slippery slope to being manipulative. Everyone expects things from each other when a relationship is formed, but to expect anything from someone new is creepy and unhealthy. People need to somehow promise you something before you can expect anything. If you always expect something in return when making the first advance, people will 1) feel like you're trying to sell them something, 2) be angsty around you and you will 3) be very disappointed all the time"

My translation...

If you do something for someone and expect something in return....tell them BEFORE you do the thing that if you do it you would like them to do something for you.

Besides, when it comes to more social situations, when you risk embarrassing yourself in front of people, it helps to remember, that those people:

* will hardly remember your face or name
* even if they will, other events in their lives will push your failure out of their attention very soon
* even if your failure was so memorable and hilarious that it won't be completely pushed out of their memory, those people don't have to be a part of your life after that day

I don't think anyone seriously considers that it is a bad thing to be able to branch out with different women who can introduce you to their female friends and so forth. It's just that platonic, socially-subservient and ""yes man"" traits tend not to have that effect anyway. If you take ownership of your intentions rather than trying to be the guy who does things just for their own sake and the pleasures of social niceties and all the rest, ironically you will probably find it a lot harder to get connected with the right friendship nodes in a society that is competitive and individualistic.

Really? Then i guess i'm extraordinarily lucky because this happens to be pretty often and i'm not particularly attractive. People do however tell me that i give them the impression of being a calm and safe person to confront and i receive praise for being content when by myself.

>For a community which is ""incels without hate"" where the men are clearly already trying to distinguish their group from large scale misconceptions, that is absolutely not a valid or fair assumption to make.

Disagree strongly. People on here post about being dishearted because people wrongly assume their intentions. Obviously they could need some advice on this.

>Then the problem is not with intention but communication.

Yes, exactly! That is the point



>You haven't really shown what the positive aspects are.

OP did. I won't take the time to explain to you in detail since OP did that excellently, but i can tell you the key aspects i get from this exact advice.

Self-dating: i feel appreciated and valued, i sometimes meet new people this way and experience new things.

Being selfless when meeting people: people feel comfortable with me and i never get sour when new people/strangers don't return my gestures.

Not giving a fuck: this is about picking battles, though. People instantly get the feeling that i don't judge and i speak my mind so they easily feel safe with me. People used to use me for this, but now i catch on to this and i just tell them how i feel about thst because i don't give a fuck if people will dislike me for who i am. If i lose someone i appreciate, heartbreak is a close friend and i know how to deal with pain. It's better than to give too many fucks.

328,"What you describe is one specific problem you have (to which I can certainly relate), while someone else might have problems with a different point in the post, but the thing is, if he went into great detail for every single point, it would be 20x longer and nobody would bother reading all of it. People fill entire books trying to answer the question you're asking (how to have a good conversation). I don't know the answer myself, so I can't give any good advice, sorry. I guess it could help a bit to listen to other people have those kinds of conversations, e.g. at work (although they rarely get very personal...), and to try and notice how the conversation is propagated at each turn."

Sharing of myself, however, is something i do to people whom have continually returned the basic niceness and otherwise showed interest in making relations. Being  nice and being generous is different. I would still greet people with a smile even if they called me an asshole at some point. I would however never share any precious free time or food with them unless they showed some of the general niceness and interest.

This is pretty hard to explain actually. But you do have people out there who are angry if people don't respond to greetings or compliments and i think that's the wrong step to be diappointed."

Why do you assume I haven't tried it? I have done so, many times. I'm not even saying to never do it or that there is no benefit, e.g. building up a thick skin is a positive aspect of it. But do it over a long period of time and it absolutely will chip away at your self-esteem I can promise you.

>i guess i'm extraordinarily lucky because this happens to be pretty often and i'm not particularly attractive 

This can happen for various reasons. In particular if you are a woman, people are 10 times more likely to speak to you and want to keep you company. The effect absolutely will not be the same for everyone.

&#x200B;

>Disagree strongly. People on here post about being dishearted because people wrongly assume their intentions. Obviously they could need some advice on this. 

Yes, you're right: they need advice on this ... or, maybe, the people that wrongly assume their intentions are the problem and not the individuals who suffer from this. If people are going to interpret you in the worst possible way, there really is not much that can be done about this.

However your way of going about so shitty because it comes from the weak position that the sender is the one who is wrong and should feel shame for being manipulative. Mine comes a strong position of knowing what you want and only accepting that. If you want to build proper character the means are just as important as the ends.

To stick with the same analogies as earlier, most musicians are aware that they'll never be rockstars, but they still pick up an instrument. It's to play music, and it's rewarding to see how good you've become with practice.

For me, it's cooking. I don't do it to impress girls or become a chef, I do it because it's fun and rewarding. I bring food to my coworkers once in a while, and that makes them happy.

Too afraid to speak up and discuss things with ""their own kind""  for fear of getting shunned... is so sad.

No one wants the burden of helping or associating with us. It's too draining and also gets you nowhere. "
374,"Oh this is great, I seem to have the honor of being in conversation with a mod. So let me please take the opportunity to demonstrate to you a more elaborate view on IT.

>We also try our best to censor personal information including usernames and are against doxxing.

I think this goal is achieved. The dark side of this moon, is that in many cases I doubt, that the quoted examples are real at all, because there is no source given with them. Sometimes I assume that the quoted shit is indeed invented by IT users themselves. And to be strict, even if these examples are copied from braincels, it is still possible that they have been placed there by an IT user in order to further ridicule incels. But ruling out such skulduggery is out of scope of the mods.

Therefore let's consider the more obvious misbehavior as mentioned before, this time partly with source:

1. A bulk of 1100 IT users advocate blaming incels for desecration of dead bodies [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/98z2m8/what\_kind\_of\_expetiment\_is\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/98z2m8/what_kind_of_expetiment_is_it/)
2. A braincel post was quoted and actively ""enriched"" with the idea of  rape, just in order to once again accuse and ridicule incels. [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/99dx3c/incel\_cant\_understand\_why\_rape\_is\_bad\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/99dx3c/incel_cant_understand_why_rape_is_bad_and/)
3. Urging to suicide and bullying glorifying IT posts, collected by another user: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/95t5qq/it\_doesnt\_want\_to\_help\_incels\_they\_want\_us/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/95t5qq/it_doesnt_want_to_help_incels_they_want_us/)
4. Several times I tried to reasonably and modestly discuss with IT users. Never possible.
5. As sure as there is the amen in the church, any user in IT who tries to defend one aspect of incels, is downvoted. This happened not to just me.
6. Once there was the claim, that incels generally do not pay their taxes. I objected, that this judgement is not fair, and that I always paid my taxes. Immediate 40 downvotes.
7. A man left IncelTears because ""I can‚Äôt take it anymore"". The posts in this subreddit made him fear for the fate of his daughter. ""The mentality of an incel is sickening and frightening and to know that she could be one bad conversation away from being raped or murdered by one of them gives me panic attacks."" This is the result of this perpetual toxic rain falling from the IncelTears cloud. [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/995b3u/why\_i\_am\_leaving\_inceltears/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/995b3u/why_i_am_leaving_inceltears/)
8. One gets the impression that not only that all incels are rapist, but even worse, that all rapists are incels.
9. While there is hatred in Braincels against women, it is based of real personal bitter experience of their members. On the other hand the hatred in IncelTears against incels is mostly taken out of fresh air, based only on some idiotic utterances on the Internet. Most of these hateful IT user do not even know one incel in person.
10. The hatred of Braincel users is diffusely spread over half of humanity, while the hatred of IncelTears users is focused on a minority, the incel, which are suffering anyway from life. That makes quite a difference in severeness and pain it induces."

377,"Main points is that human attraction is based mostly if not entirely on your appearance/sex appeal. If you lack that you cannot get a partner no matter what you do. IE if you're ugly you'll die alone with no hope to experiencing intimacy/sex without either paying for it (which wouldn't solve the incel issue since there is no love and the person you pay obviously does not like you or want to do it willingly, just for money) or having to get extreme reconstructive surgery to drastically altar your appearance to potentially attracting someone. 

Many examples of women taking interest in criminals because they are physically attractive whilst ugly men are shown to be either ignored or simply used as a means of monetary gain.   
When all this info comes to people who all their lives were led to believe women were all collectively these kind/gentle beings and that all you gotta do to get one's affection is to simply be a stand-up/well hearted person  only to learn that was all a lie, it can be VERY detrimental to a person's mind, emotions and overall outlook.  
It's a mixture of disbelief, confusion, anger/frustration that makes you question everything you thought was true, ON TOP OF knowing you aren't and will never be good enough. That dating is nothing more than a superficial rat race with little to no fulfillment and that society continues to place your worth as a man on whether you've had sex or not.

(nothing against her, she's great, I might ask her out) Two girls in my student org, one doesn't want to talk to me unless she has to, the other loves talking to me and is the one I took out on a date. I don't know how to even play the numbers game better here. Between 2 jobs, 5 classes, and a student org, my schedule is full. I can't increase my odds any better than they are now. Between each of those areas of my life, I have a far wider range of (and likely bigger number of) social connections than most people I know. I'm good at socializing. People like me.

And as for the 2nd point, there are plenty of people that are willing to help as long as you help yourself. The main issue is the steadfastness on how the world works.

Why is that tolerated? "
386,"Well when it‚Äôs phrased like that, it makes sense that they would all be so emotionally charged. However, I feel like some of these core beliefs are just off. Mainly the whole focus on ‚Äúwomen seek power and good looks and nothing else‚Äù bit. Remember, women are people too. The whole ‚Äúhypergamy‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt seem so strange if you reverse the role; if the princess of some country was in love with you, you would want to marry up if you could. And a lot of the time the whole ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù thing isn‚Äôt as clear-cut as it seems. Some of these people are actually good to them, even if they are standoffish jerks to everyone else. And sometimes it‚Äôs just honestly poor decision-making that comes with regrets. Lastly, appearance is NOT static no matter what you look like. Anyone can always shave, comb, exercise, wear nicer clothes, and change some little things. But it seems like for some of these people, they would rather blame something out of their control than put in hard work to keep themselves in a good position. It is a grim reality, but only if you think it is reality. Make sure to talk to a therapist if you need to."
387,In my book you're doing a pretty good job already!
388,"You're right there. I'm not exactly in the same boat as most incels, as I do have some friends with whom I socialize regularly (I do have a job after all) but know that a lot of incels don't, and a good amount of them are agoraphobes, or would find a space like that threatening. My point isn't so much pertaining to myself so much as trying to help you understand the position that some of us are in. 

The fact is that despite your own good will, the majority (and I must stress that we're not just talking about the vocal few) on IT condone shaming and bullying incels. Sure, they're fucked in the head. You're right, but what IT does and perpetuates isn't helping anyone and is entirely detrimental. 

The purpose of the sub to begin with is to spread hate by shaming mentally ill people who obviously need some kind of help, if only an end to their misery. To IT's credit, there is quite a bit of encouraging us to commit suicide, which is fair enough. 

My point is that you take issue with the misogyny, hate, and perpetuation of violence that incels spread, while actively defending a group that majorly and by design perpetuates violence against incels under the pretense that ""Oh we're not all like that."" when infact that is what the sub was intended to be.

If you want to say we deserve more suffering, to kill ourselves, to be round up and shot, then fair enough. That's your opinion and you're welcome to it, I'm not even too inclined to say that it's the wrong one. At that point, however, you have to relinquish your moral high ground and realize that while operating on what is certain to be a drastically higher plane of intelligence quotient than us incels, IT still has the animalistic human desire to hurt and put others below themselves, wherever their conscience will allow."

>4. If the subreddit scared him, he should honestly leave and will make no  attempt to bring him back. But the world is, unfortunately, a very scary  place where a lot of bad things happen.

If a subreddit scared *her*, *she* should honestly leave and will make no  attempt to bring *her* back. But the world is, unfortunately, a very scary  place where a lot of bad things happen.

See what I mean, why not applying this same reasoning to for example Braincels and leave these people there in peace?

>5. Hating more people doesn‚Äôt make it any better. Hatred of any group is a problem.

So why tolerate the hatred in IncelTears and not that in other subreddits?

>6. If somebody seriously says some of the things said on braincels, it  makes sense that people would be concerned. I don‚Äôt know David Duke in  real life but I know from his uttering on the internet that he is a bad  person.

Idk what you are referring to. What kind of things said on braincels? What's the context to a ""David Duke""?"

393,"""The whole ‚Äúhypergamy‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt seem so strange if you reverse the role; if the princess of some country was in love with you, you would want to marry up if you could.""

No I wouldn't and most incels wouldn't either. It goes against their own beliefs of things like social status being an irrelevant trait. Even if I did, this argument is terrible since it's just some way to make it seem like it's ok for them be lonely and miserable because ""well u kno ppl wanna all d8 kings/queens bro"".

""But it seems like for some of these people, they would rather blame something out of their control than put in hard work to keep themselves in a good position. It is a grim reality, but only if you think it is reality. Make sure to talk to a therapist if you need to.""

Any person with an IQ above a single digit would rather not. Why would you put a bunch of effort for nothing? That thing out of your control determines the quality of your life as well? Also what ""good"" position? There were never in one lol."
394,"And what next? Every new social opportunity I get myself into I expect to be different but it's literally the same story since puberty.

My friends don't put themelves ""out there"" as much a I do because they aren't bottom whatever percent of male attractiveness. They've met their gfs through class or through mutual friends or a random hookup at a wedding. Nothing I do will ever yield those results - I've been doing those things for years and they've never gotten me anywhere close. What am I supposed to do? Same thing for the next 7 years until I'm 30 and some woman is sad enough to deal with me?  If no woman likes me now at 23 when every woman is looking for some guy, any woman who might like me later on must be out of desperation."
395,"As I‚Äôve stated before, suicide is not the answer. Originally, from what I can tell, the point of the sub was to make sure the ideology didn‚Äôt run rampant and uncontested in the market of ideas. Even though many people just bandwagon onto any group that‚Äôs against another group just to hate, from what I can tell that wasn‚Äôt the point of this subreddit.

And yes, I‚Äôm all in favor of people getting mental help. I‚Äôm sure most of us wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with the people themselves outside of their ideas. Why do you think incels complain so much that everyone says that they have a ‚Äúbad personality‚Äù? These people ostracized themselves, and the best answer is to get mental help. 

Nobody deserves to suffer, and being hateful because of self-loathing doesn‚Äôt fix anything. I haven‚Äôt heard anyone say they actively or passively wanted to commit an act of violence against anyone with the ideology because of the ideology. We aren‚Äôt against people getting mental help. We don‚Äôt hate the people. We are opposed to the ideas that stem from the damaged worldview that a large collective of people who need mental help have thought up. The original use of ‚ÄúIncel‚Äù was on a board to help the community before it spiraled out of control. If and when we hear that somebody is dropping the incel mindset through therapy, we don‚Äôt scream at them to get back to their hole. We support them and try to help them to rehumanize the people around them. 

TL;DR: Hateful people exist everywhere. People misuse power too. However, a group can still be good even if a majority of its members are not. "

397,"Suicide doesn‚Äôt fix the problem. It does guarantee that you will never get better, though. And what exactly are you apathetic about? And remember that unfortunately sometimes self improvement is forcing yourself to do crap that you hate in the short term to help in the long term."
398,"From what I can tell, 1100 is much less than the total number of subscribers to the subreddit. And this was about people faking posts.

The difference in the lack of nuance between IT and braincels is rather large. 

You made my point for me on number 3.

But IT say things that are actually true, not just peoples‚Äô world views.

I dislike the hatred on both sides. But disagreeing with an ideology does not mean hating everyone with that ideology.

A popular incel claim of self-defense is ‚Äúhow do they know we have bad personalities and aren‚Äôt just horribly ugly?‚Äù People on braincels have advocated for rape, incest, and pedophilia. David Duke is the current leader of the KKK. I‚Äôm not saying that incels are racist, but saying things equivalently hateful doesn‚Äôt look too good.

EDIT: Btw hatred does not justify more hatred. Saying that IT is hateful doesn‚Äôt mean that braincels gets the ‚Äúmean pass‚Äù too."
399,"I‚Äôm not saying they deserve to be miserable, but blaming women for all of it isn‚Äôt the right answer.

And this may come as a shock, but most of these ‚Äúhideous monsters‚Äù look perfectly fine, though they may not stand out. Your looks have far less of an impact on most things in life than other factors. E.G. People with black-sounding names are less likely to be selected for jobs or colleges, while (as long as you are well-kept) being attractive doesn‚Äôt change your prospects for either of these things."

430,"I have. I do it all the time and constantly post on various subs.

Regardless of how people wanna spin it, men have low self-esteem and body issues too. And I say this as a nice-looking guy with a big dick. I struggle with low self-esteem everyday. I don‚Äôt talk to women well, was bullied growing up, called ugly and creepy by women the majority of the time I tried to ask them out. I mean I‚Äôm not sure what the fuck people expect? The reality is as a woman, no matter how unattractive or ugly you are, you can make a Bumble or Tinder and collect hundreds of matches from hotter guys in minutes. Instant ego boost.

As a man on the same level, or even an unconventionally-handsome one like me, we don‚Äôt have that luxury. Instead, we stare at empty inboxes while women naturally gravitate to the smoking hot dudes. So yeah, I show off my big dick. Oftentimes, the woman will at least talk to me afterward and compliment me. Either way, it‚Äôs a fuck ton better than not getting any matches or endless read-not-replied messages. At the end of the day, most people use these shithole apps to feel hot. So women can post ass and boob shots for their profiles and I‚Äôm evil for showing off my long bulge? Fuck that.

Newsflash: it‚Äôs not a man problem but a desperation problem. I‚Äôve been sent unsolicited nudes and cyber-stalked by various women, and the common denominator was they were ugly as shit. Not just ugly, I mean UG-LEE. Like so ugly, they don‚Äôt even get attention on Tinder. They were dying for dick. The reality is desperate people do desperate things for attention. Women are no different than men. Studies have shown they are just as horny as men. They wanna feel hot too. There are just more desperate men as a result of guys being forced to go on the prowl while women can sit back and collect compliments/matches like Goddamn royalty. All women can do this too as long as they aren‚Äôt super ugly. Unlike men, where only the conventionally hot guys have this luxury. Plus, gender roles play a part as well (guys who have sex with a bunch of women are studs, women who have sex with a bunch of dudes are stigmatized as ‚Äúsluts‚Äù). Not to mention the VAST FUCKING MAJORITY of the time, men are the aggressor. They are expected to make the first move. Something women won‚Äôt comprehend as they essentially play the fucking waiting game. They will never experience the awkwardness of asking a woman out and not being sure if she‚Äôs attracted to you or not. Nor will she usually experience the soul-crushing fun of being rejected.

If gender roles were reversed, and women were forced to go on the prowl while even ugly men could sit back and collect matches all night, you‚Äôd have tons of non-hot women cyber-stalk and send unsolicited nudes for the dude‚Äôs attention. Especially since the guys would be focused on the superhot women. 

You‚Äôre telling me the okay/cute young woman with big boobs isn‚Äôt going to send unsolicited nudes to the hot guys ignoring her for the Instagram models? üòÇ No one is on those fucking apps to stare at an empty inbox.

This is just reality. People want attention and to feel hot. Deal with it."

438,">I don't know if they are a chad tactic but they are a tactic of tacky, immature, jerks. I'm happy to see that this sub does not have those type of guys . . . . well done gentlemen!

I up-voted this post.

In all honesty, I have found it quite easy to not send one of these unsolicited pictures.   Perhaps it is a generational thing.   At 43 years of age, I just don't remember ever thinking at any point in my life that this was a good idea.   It's always sounded more like a joking meme, and less like something people actually do.

It's nice to hear I am perhaps not a tacky or immature jerk, and possibly even worthy of gentleman status.   Thanks, Ms Bekiala, and I hope you are having a good day."

I wish the world wasn't like this but so many crappy people are relatively successful and good people less so.  I know there are exceptions in both directions but I wish there were more.   I'm in the US and recently listened to the Podcast Presidential (very informative and also boring) and we have had some pretty nasty people as president.  Not fair or right but there it is.

&#x200B;

In someways I have made peace with this over the decades but it still bothers me.  The incel situation for individuals who would make fabulous partners and perhaps start an amazing families is just one of these situations.  Hmmmm . . . . am I sounding black pilled here . . . I'm actually pretty confused about pill definitions."
450,"I'm a bit doubtful that sending pictures of boy parts to women will get you laid.  I have heard that it can work for homosexual men.  If it has worked for you, would you mind telling about your experience?"
451,then why do so many people do it that it's something girls complain about?
452,"I used to think girls were just being dramatic until a friend of mine had a stranger add her on Snapchat and kept sending her dick pics despite her asking him to stop then she blocked him but then another random account started sending her dick pics and we recognized the dick. It‚Äôs weird to recognize some other dudes dick... (pro tip, don‚Äôt make your snap name the same as your other social media names, you never know when a dick will become attached). "
453,She threatened to doxx me and kinda did. It could have been much worse though.
454,In my experience girls usually don‚Äôt like dick pics unless they really like you. It has definitely made girls ghost me. However I‚Äôm referring to the mentality. I‚Äôll send a dick pic and have no problems getting laid. No one here sends dick pics and no one here gets laid.
455,"I think at first people didn‚Äôt know it was gross? If you look at the course of human history, Texting and social media are new things, so we‚Äôre still trying to figure out ethics/morals through digital communications. Most people would complain about flashers, but there are still flashers. Knowing that someone doesn‚Äôt like your actions doesn‚Äôt always prohibit people, and some guys deliberately send unsolicited dick pics to women who they KNOW don‚Äôt want them. (I think one of my comments is in regards to a friend who asked a stranger to stop sending her fap videos on snap and he kept making new accounts to send them after she blocked him). The good news is that because some dudes keep sending unsolicited dick pics, it gives those of us who don‚Äôt send them an advantage. "

560,"Cars 2 was good. There, I said it"
561,"**Well, kids spend most of their day in school, and that was a nightmare for me:**

Started out year one as some kind of prodigy. I was known as the smart one.

Constant physical and psychological bullying from both teachers and students at school.

Constant bullying from both educators and other kids at the after-school place I went to because my parents worked till late.

Can't relate to other kids. Pretty much friendless.

The only ""panic attack"" I've had in my entire life was caused by a teacher verbally attacking me for something I didn't even do. After that day I remember feeling dumber and slower each morning (dunno exactly what happened).

I talked back to my teachers when they were being idiots. Sometimes got written up for bad behaviour.

""Obviously"" kids are always wrong and adults are always right...

Constantly grounded at home.

My parents don't believe that my teachers are the problem. Instead, I'm the one to blame.

Had no motivation to study.

My grades kept plummeting.

I fail and have to repeat a school year.

Even more grounded. Can't even cope with video games any more.

9th grade arrives.

Finally have good teachers, my grades go from failing at almost everything to having max grades in most subjects.

Enter 10th grade in a new school. I realize that I'm so socially impaired that I can't even make friends.

I was once again known as the smart kid. Until that point I had actually forgotten that I was considered ""smart"" in the past.

Got called an autist. Even though I was offended, it made me research a bit about autism and I find out it would explain my hardships when growing up.

To this day my parents dismiss my suspicions. *""You don't look like an autist""*. Who even knows at this point...

Got my first crush. A girl from another class.

Took almost a full year to gain courage to talk to her.

Obviously, she already has a boyfriend. At least I managed to get a temporary friend.

12th grade arrives. I was once again bullied by a teacher.

Gym teacher, lies to other teachers about me and purposefully fails my grade. Once again, the adult is always in the right.

The sweetheart of my English teacher was the only one who believed me. She's probably the most empathetic human I've ever met.

School's over anyway. I'm now ~~19~~ 18. Begin university.

As a repeat of 10th grade, I'm unable to make any significant friends. I'm no longer the smart and talented kid (though I disagree I ever was), and I'm actually one of the worst in class. No friends, no girlfriend. Every girl has a boyfriend anyway, it never even began.

And here I am today. I wouldn't go back for anything."
562,You know
563,"Nope, I just believe in miracles."
564,"Galatians 5:22-23

""But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.""

You say you are seeing a lot of sin in your life.  Well it is good, you are recognizing sin as sin, that is the first step.  Do you believe God can change your heart and change lives?  And are you willing to let him?  We all have things to work through, but if we are willing to change and willing to have faith it may be granted by God's grace.

Many have been through it, it has been recorded over the last 2,000 years. All manner of vices has been cleansed from people's lives, including my own.  You are no less worthy than the rest of us."
565,"I had them from 2005 to 2009, I remember those models fondly. Each year their would be a new gimmick, like a new gun or spinner thingy. I didin't have a ton of money but whenever I did me and my brother would go out and buy our own canister. Then we'd play with them in our room, making up storylines and arcs."
566,For me I never really got better. I sort of drifted from one drug to the next trying to feel happy and content but never being able to. Like I remember wanting to die when I was like 8-9 years old but my attention span was so short I never stayed on it for too long. Its been a constant problem throughout my life. I really doubt it will get better.

They had the skills to elevate themselves, but their lives aren‚Äôt something to be jealous of. 

Would I rather be in this position where I‚Äôm not cruel, never have been, I am open-minded, honest, genuine and kind to others or would I prefer a carbon-copy life with 0 uniqueness?  I suffer a lot but I prefer this life.  I don‚Äôt want to be a replica."

769,I think you‚Äôre getting ‚Äúattraction to bullies‚Äù and ‚Äúattraction to men who are physically and intellectually superior than others‚Äù a little mixed up because unless Darwin said those exact words it‚Äôs highly unlikely he meant it in the same context of the above comment.  Also you claim it‚Äôs well known yet I haven‚Äôt seen it throughout my years of life.
770,90% of Darwin's theories turned out to be partly or entirely wrong. Also he mostly studied birds and plants. Have you read origin of species? It's not psychology.
771,"This seems like a very reliable source and I fully acknowledge and applaud the pedigree of the website, furthermore it seems as though the website has a well thought out and accurate poll and research basis.  However, I personally feel that this article is specifically speaking purely on dominance and superiority in the form of two men in a power clash, rather than what the original post and comment seemed to claim of it being a high school bully.  This difference is what sets apart the claims of women being attracted to classic cliche bullies and women being attracted to physically and intellectually superior men."
772,"I fully agree with you that some women are attracted to those characteristics and that humans are animals and we can‚Äôt just ignore centuries and millennia of genetics and evolution.  But look around in the present, people are becoming more self aware and conscious of the fact that we don‚Äôt need to follow these instincts to survive anymore.  Which is exactly why you‚Äôre able to see so many men that don‚Äôt fall under these categories pursue fulfilling and happy lives with many friends and significant others."

785,When 2 men have a Chad face the female would prefer the bully
786,"Domestic abusers are definitively bullies, so females do like bullies. Females actively chose and most likely chose to have sex with a domestic abuser, they do bear responsibility with their choices. Females should use their personality detector on domestic abusers like they use on us incels. Do you really expect incels to just fly with that excuse when we are constantly told our personality is terrible?

50 Shades of Grey was a smash hit and not a box office bomb. That is hard evidence on what females actually like.

Incels do not owe females anything at all. Incels do not have to call females anything other than female or upvote them on reddit. It shows your clear lack of empathy thinking that incels should never say anything negative about females despite an incel's experience. Females have never loved incels and should not expect love from incels. Not loving and kissing the ass of females is not hate."

799,God I fucking hate females for being like this.

I also have beta, normie friends, who have hot girlfriends. Fuck black pill bullshit, it's hard enough finding a girl without it."

I do fuck face. I‚Äôm taking BJJ for this very reason. It gives smaller guys their best chance but even then the larger guys in my class dominate

God I hate you fuckers"
835,That has nothing to do with whether females find bullies attractive.
836,"Facts:

* Domestic abusers are bullies
* females have sex with domestic abusers
* As a result females like bullies

Females say they can detect ""muhsoginy"" and ""bad puhsonalities"" hence they reject incels but that goes out the window with domestic abuse. I have no sympathy at all as a result and there are plenty of men who are not abusive who are desperate but females reject them. A shy meek individual is very unlikely to be abusive. Females also spout bullshit about ""niceguys"" which they use as an excuse to fuck abusers. They made the choice, it is partly their fault.

> Maybe in hs when girls haven‚Äôt matured enough to realize the jocks can be assholes and the guys that are really worth it

848,"I mostly agree, what's important to me is for people to understand that they may like bullies for dominance despite the bullying behavior.

Hence ""male privilege"" and so on

Broad, sweeping generalisations are made about men as a group regardless of their position in life and the world

I certainly don't need to tell readers here that men do not have equal outcomes in life as every single one of you knows that all too well"

Back at home, I had a swing out in the back, where I would spend hours. I would often go out there to try to think about where I went wrong with my life, contemplate suicide, or just to spend some time isolated from the rest of the world. Sometimes I would go out there and sing about how much I hated my life. I would stay on that swing until the wee hours of the night almost every day. It was fun, but at the same time, a way to cope with my painful life. 

If I had a girlfriend, I might cry in front of her. I would hate to inconvenience her, but I have so much sadness bottled up in me from the past countless years, and no one to vent to."

Anyway I think they like cuddles, like at almost every human being."
975,"After rough sex with Chad, they do sometimes"
976,"Yes. A lot. Even more than men.

Cuddling has something special, resting your head in the chest if a woman, hearing her heartbeat, you feel beign the biggest and smallest man on earth, you feel weak, but nothing can hurt or bother you, nothing matters, the universe is meaningless, there only exists that precise moment, while it lasts."
977,"Yes, especially after sex."
978,"Yes. With anyone actually, I used to do that with my classmates."
979,"Unless someone has issues with touch, physical touch releases oxytocin which is a feel-good hormone that makes you feel safe/happy. Cuddling is essentially just a big oxytocin generator, so I‚Äôd imagine most people regardless of gender would enjoy and benefit from cuddling.

1003,"Sex is part of a healthy romantic relationship. Emotional understanding and physical contact is important too, but I think if all you want to do is get hugged by a women then make friends with a female. It's not that hard. You know how easy it to be friendzoned by a girl? There is a cute girl where I work with who will hug and talk to ANYONE. She just won't fuck anyone who comes her way.

Now if that's what you TRULY want then the old just lift and shower bro thing will work. I however, suspect this is not the case. Interacting with women =/= attracting women. That's just the truth. If no one will even acknowledge you or listen to your problems, then it is something you are doing wrong.

This is coming from a socially awkward 24 year old college drop out KHV, so don't even start by Chading me. Yes, I lift. Yes women have made passes at me, but believe me that's not enough to get a relationship. The only time I've ever seen women literally throw themselves at men is if they are basically gigachad, which let's face it, he doesn't even care for the emotional support at that point. He just see women as another hole to stick his 10 inch penis in.

Edit: Minus the kissing and putting your face in her breasts thing. That's something only women who are into you will do, but that is kind of vaguely sexual anyway. Honestly, I've had strippers do that kind of shit. I even had a stripper once listen to my problems. You'll have to pay for it, but at this point what do you have to lose?"
1004,"There's a lot of female-only things, such as parks, LadyDriver that is an uber for girls, gyms. There are even female-only house for homeless, even if the porcentage is higher for men. First wave and second wave feminism?, yeah, probaly, but third and fourth?, not equality."
1005,*All* I *have* are negative thoughts.
1006,"life is but a futile struggle, and yet we keep going"
1007,"yes women do usually genuinely enjoy cuddling.  some women are apparently reluctant to cuddle partners because of fears it has to lead to sex every time.  or weren't brought up to be comfortable with touch, that's what the 'given a chance' bit referred to.  you could post on here if you ever wanted to, i know there's other women lurkers/posters who would also answer"
1008,"hahaha that's ok. every week one of our teachers brought a documentary or something for us to watch, so we used to sit down on the floor and just watch it quietly, eventually I played with someone's hair. I guess this count as cuddling? Idk."

1010,"What's described here isn't really a hug. It could be kinda sexual but basically comes down to using touch to communicate ""I love you and want to protect you"". It could also be done by a mother towards her son for example."
1011,"homeless women are incredibly vulnerable.  i just said in another comment, i don't susbscribe to 'women are wonderful' but keep a sense of balance here.  plenty of men can be total shits, you just have to watch the news to realise that"
1012,"**Why is there an Uber just for women?** Because there are male Uber drivers that harass female passengers.

**Why are there female only gyms?** Because women in gyms sometimes get harassed by men.

**Why are there more homeless shelters for women?** Because women are generally the ones that take care of children and children are more vulnerable to the elements than adults. Plus, homeless women are more likely to fall prey to sex trafficking than homeless men.

If women didn't get raped, attacked, and harassed, they wouldn't have to come up with special versions of things for themselves."

1015,"Quite literally a shit crusade. Why, did you expect me to reply with something violent so that the people over IT can wank their hate boner? Actually, they would still wank their hate boner over this"
1016,"\>Homeless women are incredibly vulnerable. plenty of men can be total shits.

And here I press the same key, isn't men vulnerable too?, Isn't some women total shits too? Plus, men are like, 80% of homeless people."
1017,"But it only happens to women?, That's the point, harassing, raping, assault in general isn't a gendered thing, making things for one sex only isn't equality."

1020,"Not at all. And who cares what IT do, they'll just parody regardless. The sub is ""reaching"" when it comes to content."
1021,"not vulnerable to rape & murder the way a homeless woman is.  for all women's bad behaviour they don't tend to be violent at quite the same rates as men.  just looking at the local news in my area: man wanted for flashing women while driving his car, man wanted for burglary, man took illicit pictures of teenager as she showered, man pleads guilty to assaulting heavily pregnant woman FFS.  None of this means i don't have time for male issues in life, but let's not pretend men are flawless either.  Man attacked girlfriend and threatened to burn house down.  Men burst into pensioner's home and stole cash.  This is just today."
1022,I never said it only happens to women only. But this is how women figured out how to cut down the harassment and attacking for themselves.
1023,could i talk to you?
1024,"For me, the latest news were Boris, Brexit and Trump. Could you link me a study or whatever about that vulnerable claim?, I've linked somewhere a link about men making half of rape victims of 2012 IIRC."

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right, I think everyone can have preferences, but I actually... I mean, it's semantics, but I don't think having reasonable preferences is ""shallow"". 

A girl saying she wants a guy who can actually take care of himself and make a half-decent living.. I think that's reasonable. Demanding a guy who makes over $100,000 a year and saying they'd never settle for less (when that's like... What, 10% of the male population)? That's shallow.

A guy saying he wants a girl in half-decent shape who isn't morbidly obese is fine IMO. Saying that a girl who has the slightest amount of extra fat on their belly is ""a fat whale who I'd never even look at"", would of course, be extremely shallow.

I'm throwing out crazy and more limiting examples when it comes to percentages of population. But look at average height in the United States. Saying you demand a guy be over 6 feet tall, when that excludes 2/3 of the male population, based on a SINGLE TRAIT... That's shallow. Look, I get it, some guys get the short end of the stick. Being 5'3"" as a guy is sure as hell to be a tough life. But DEMANDING the top 33% over a single trait (and not a collection maybe of ideal traits) means you're probably putting WAAAAY too much weight on that single trait, which again, I think is shallow. 

Going back to the income vs weight thing.. Actually, just look at how the two are treated. ""Young successful women are having a tough time finding dateable men! They're all poor!!"" You know, instead of saying ""Wow, this is a societal problem and men are suddenly not doing very well, and how can we fix that"", the responde is ""Men are doing badly... It sucks that women need to put up with that."" And then on the fat acceptance thing, ""No, you go girl! Society should conform to you!""

So I think these examples really come full circle. And the fact is... I agree with you on why the Tess Holiday situation is the way it is. It's about nothing but trying to appeal to a specific demographic that's extremely loud, and a movement that's very ""trendy"" right now. But I think my biggest point is that if it were talking about men, it wouldn't be ALLOWED to be trendy. ""Suck it up"" kind of thing. ""You're fat, and that's just against women's preferences sweetheart. Maybe if you would not be fat, you'd do fine!""

The attitudes on the same issues are so radically different that it's actually kind of insulting to basic intelligence. But then we can go into deeper philosophical discussions on how women are ""more valuable"" than men since they have a relatively long gestation period, and a finite number of eggs to reproduce, which could be why society (and men) naturally coddle women more. And I'm not even saying ""OMG, THAT'S WRONG, WOMEN ARE TERRIBLE!!"" Mostly, I'm just pointing out the double standards, and not saying any of this out of any real hatred. More like ""hatred of the game, but not the players""."
1103,"Yes. Including me, and just about everyone else. The difference is that I'll admit it. Look, I'm on the chunky side, and I'm a 4 overall. But I'll 1000% admit I'm not eager to date a girl who's morbidly obese. I'm being real. And no, I don't expect a supermodel, either. I doubt I could relate to most anyway, so even on that level, it generally wouldn't work. Anyway..

Somehow, preferences for men have become prohibited. If you're a man, ""improve yourself"". If you're a woman, ""men should love you just the way you are!"" I'm exaggerating a bit, but you know what I mean.

Tell you what: Find me the male equivalent of Tess Holiday being on the covers of world-famous magazines whose covers are often centered around physical attractiveness. I'm SURE there's an exception somewhere, but like I said, you probably get what I mean to an extent.."

That's the reason you see women from 4'11 to 5'11 with the same requirement for a man to be at least 6 feet tall. It's not that the short women are ""more shallow"" or ""overcompensating"" and the taller women are ""more fair"", their own height just isn't important - what's important is that the male is **taller than other males** - because men are status objects to women and if a status object isn't fancier than the status objects of others, it's worthless.

In my mind if I was in a situation where I became less attractive than before, the first thing I would compromise would be unalterable physical traits that have no bearing on character.

I have noticed that at least men will acknowledge this, whereas women seem to be deathly allergic to being labeled as shallow. I respect people who at least own their true beliefs even if I dislike them for it."
1136,">like someone not thinking you're attractive isn't shallow to me. you can't force someone to think you're attractive 

Do you know about the fat acceptance movement? It was not to make you find bigger women attractive. This is a social movement seeking to change anti-fat bias in social attitudes by raising awareness about obstacles faced by fat persons for the general public. Right now, men are being judged for their height (and other bone structures), but unlike weight, height is genetic and not hazardous to our health like obesity. There is ***nothing*** a man can do if he is being discriminated against by women for his height. Some women have said men who are shorter than 6ft are a [waste](https://twitter.com/sonessasary/status/561251830634524672), [useless](https://twitter.com/NonnyUzo/status/447928329157357568), and should [kill themselves](https://twitter.com/shawna_philly/status/490617982834728961). The point to show women's shallowness isn't to force a chick to like you for being short. It's to raise awareness of society's ugly attitude towards men's looks."

Status objects. And not necessarily solely, however it becomes more apparent in respect to romantic association and attraction, for those women who place a great value on male height - whether that's every woman in the world or only a part of them is up for interpretation. Outside of sexuality women can certainly see short men as platonic friends for example.

Absurd question. Like everything in existence, ""my life is the way it is"" as a result of cause and effect."
1158,"Facial attractiveness is not subjective. All attractive faces share certain features - defined jawline, forward growth, prominent zygos. 

You may think that there are lots of different kinds of attractive people, but that‚Äôs likely because you don‚Äôt even notice the unattractive males in your life. There are maybe ten ways to be attractive and there are a million ways to be ugly. 

It is the absolute definition of shallow to judge people based on their face. I see that this idea bothers you, because you are guilty of it. You are dismissing all of a persons accomplishments and their personality for a genetic marker that was determined at birth. How is that not shallow? Women literally don‚Äôt care what you‚Äôve done or how you behave. If you have an ugly face, you will never be dating material. If you have an attractive face, you will always be dating material.

Relationships are often started for pragmatic, unromantic and unsexual reasons, more often in the past than in the modern age, and more often when women are past a certain era in their lives and opt for stability rather than excitement. The term ""beta bux"" is well understood in incel spheres. 

If you want to see evidence of height having decisive value for women, simply look at the tallest people on the earth, the [Dutch](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2015.0211). Or go to any dating site and look at the requirements women tend to list.

1207,"Because ultimately, when you have enhanced everything you can, there‚Äôs still your short skeleton and shitty facial bone structure. The last instance keeping you away from chadism."
1208,"There‚Äôs a door policy for a reason you know, clubs where people go to party and get wasted are about exclusivity because sex and partying are about status"
1209,Literally millimeters of bone are what keeps you from being Chad
1210,"It‚Äôs all in your head. Chad thinks differently than you. For one he doesn‚Äôt call himself Chad, and for two he doesn‚Äôt blame others for his shortcomings. Everyone has flaws. Weather you have a micro penis, bad acne, tiny tits, bad teeth, a big nose, maybe your albino, or a hemaphrodite. Maybe you‚Äôre missing a limb, have Aspergers, or are trans. Any of these things will mean you will have to work harder to compensate and overcome, but the only thing that GUARANTEES failure is having a bad attitude and giving up. 

So quit bitching. You are not special. You are not unique. You don‚Äôt have an extraordinary bone structure. You just have a quitters attitude, which unfortunately, is also quite common. Buck up soldier! Get the fuck back on that horse and quit wallowing in self pity! The only one you can count on to love you is yourself so you best get to it!"
1211,You sound like a 50 year old dad telling his kid to just walk up to a manager and telling him to hire him thinking that'll get him the job.
1212,"Thanks. I watched captain marvel, worked on my personality, and took a shower.... and my life changed for the better."
1213,"I mean I‚Äôm presently self employed as a web developer and in order to get contracts (or ideally long term employment, that is what I am doing) I am messaging various managers to get a job. I have faced 86 rejections since I started keeping track. 

I am 30 and not a dad. I‚Äôm just someone that was where you are and improved."
1214,At least she's gonna be loyal to you... Man's best friend after all.
1215,i hope she has a great day :)
1216,"Me and my girl enjoying the wind, free of those who look down on us"

1260,There's always that one douchey comment at the bottom with deserved downvotes
1261,Eat shit.
1262,No she didn't she can't speak english
1263,But dogs are generally better
1264,Yeah incel have dogs why do they even complain lol . dogs are way better !
1265,I don't think they will mock you for having a best friend if you respect her. Many non incel treat their pets like their best freinds or their kids. It's great you find a best freind.
1266,I'm glad :) this photo made me smile! Dogs are the best
1267,"np!! i hope she has a nice day :‚Ä¢)
(also, off topic, but if you need someone to talk to im here for you!)"
1268,"while you're holding her hand on her birthday, simping her w/ dog treats she's thinking about gargling German Shepard or Rottweiler cock. It's truly over for humancels. 

sorry I couldn't resist lol. This is a wholesome post tho and happy birthday to your dog"
1269,I figured she was a lhasa or that. She's a little cutie.
1270,Lolol

1274,Extremely advanced humor
1275,I love her so much lol
1276,"I gotta thank the reddit admins tho. Thanks to them, I stopped posting on braincels, and my personality is starting to improve. Firstly, I gained hunter eyes. In addition, I also feel my personality bone (jaw for all you inkwells out there) growing each day."
1277,"ITcels actually believe that if they eradicate incel forums online, they will eradicate inceldom."
1278,F
1279,Remember when Reddit also rid the world of racism and Trump by banning MDE and T_D?
1280,"First they ignore you

 then they laugh at you

 then they fight you

then you win"
1281,"I am not dead, yet."

1284,I also grew 5 inches and am now a buff white blonde man with blue eyes and a chizeled chin
1285,They think it‚Äôll eradicate the black pill smh
1286,Don‚Äôt group the incel movement with altrightcel shit
1287,Shut it altrightcel we don‚Äôt need this getting banned too
1288,Same.  Gained 3 inches on my dick overnight. Totes finna slay now.
1289,Lmao when IncelTears thought we were altright.
1290,"Incels are much worse, wanting to cuddle with your looksmatch is the most hateful thing imaginable."
1291,He still has a point lol
1292,"they just lumped everyone they didnt like with incels to justify their cause, Braincels was unironicly one of the most ethnically diverse subreddits on this site"
1293,They still do
1294,I read through it and can't see how jail time could ever be justified for what he did. Can someone please explain to me if you think it's deserved.
1295,"Socially awkward kid touches girl while making an effort to be normal. Ends up convicted and girl says her life is forever ruined as she is unable to go to Oxford now because being touched by a subhuman is that traumatizing to chicks. 

Just take the honkpill, bro"
1296,This is why I don't talk to anyone anymore.  Best to be safe.
1297,"""What rational person looks up: 'how to make a friend'?""

It's over for aspiecels."
1298,People tell me all the time shit like that would never happen. I wish they were telling the truth.
1299,Meanwhile 30 year old Chad is banging 16 year old Stacy
1300,"You do not touch people you don't know, especially women. 

You DO NOT touch women even if they're seemingly friendly to you. 

Chad might get away with it, but you are not Chad.

Don't be this guy. Keep your hands in your pockets."
1301,"Another classic example of a young man, who hasn't had the romantic success of others, being deemed to be 'in the wrong' for making the same effort as his alpha counterpart... This folks...this is the double standards those 'left behind' have to deal with. 

It really is no wonder why I no longer make any effort. I'm worried sick that it'll be taken the wrong way - simply because I'm not successful when it comes to members of the opposite sex. 

Is it also any wonder why the suicide rate for men under the age of 45 is so high...?!"
1302,It‚Äôs more than a meme
1303,Imagine being a young female and someone who is not a 9/10+ tries to interact with you
1304,"As you know, the women of reddit will absolutely defend this, as they defend any case where their [ingroup bias](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491274) comes into play no matter how preposterous the double standards, and their male sycophants who are terrified of defying their masters will all instantly and mindlessly nod their heads in agreement. ""Should've kept your hands to yourself!"", unbearable invasion of personal space, predatory criminality, total lack of 'social etiquette', all of which are 100% deserving of a lengthy jail sentence and removal from society. 

On that note, I would like to make it crystal clear and with maximum visibility ( Which I'm sure others here would appreciate ) just how little sincerity or regard for justice those kind of people possess, to which end I've grabbed a couple of links from a ( Thousands-spanning ) collection that I've been building for months now for a megathread about double standards, which I will list for posterity:

[1](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/6lb9vg/whats_the_boldest_flirting_move_that_youve_tried/djtsp7l/), [2](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/9lq3gn/what_are_some_creepy_things_women_have_done_to/e78xifu/), [3](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/9lq3gn/what_are_some_creepy_things_women_have_done_to/e7a3mym/), [4](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bt9dui/girls_of_reddit_what_are_the_subtle_hints_that/eovp4bc/), [5](https://np.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/bec5dr/seems_fair/el5jqtu/), [6](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/aaj9l4/ladies_how_do_you_flirt/ectgk0n/), [7](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/6lb9vg/whats_the_boldest_flirting_move_that_youve_tried/djt2eyj/), [8](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8eup5h/what_is_your_goto_flirting_technique/dxybpy1/), [9](https://theweek.com/articles/448643/how-flirt-according-science), [10](https://np.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/b0ptui/how_to_tell_if_she_just_wants_to_be_friends/), [11](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/6cbflr/what_do_you_see_as_the_difference_between/dhtdj2w/), [12](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9eb2e6/what_are_some_signs_from_a_guy_friend_that_make/e5no9rq/), [13](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9eb2e6/what_are_some_signs_from_a_guy_friend_that_make/e5o1w3f/), [bonus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXlnUMmbfvVBmc5NqzlbFVw/videos) - Literally a million videos of women smearing themselves all over strangers in clubs, and that's one channel out of millions on it's own

All Reddit links are NP links, in which you can find: Women talking about touching guys, including 'constantly', as a 'completely mild' flirting technique, including with guys they barely know and guys whose mind they clearly didn't 'read perfectly' because they ended up rebuffing them. Men talking about the physical shit that women are always pulling off with dudes they find attractive, including the posters, even though they find it 'creepy' - yet the women can always keep doing it scots-free. Women describing guys touching their lower waist or backs briefly as an acceptable 'signal' ( I.E, no explicitly consent or previous sexual relationship necessary ), and an article about flirting from researchers which states the following:

>""But what works better than anything else? Touching. And research has isolated which types of touching are regarded as ""merely friendly,"" in the zone of ""plausible deniability,"" or ""going nuclear"" - Friendly: Shoulder push, shoulder tap, handshake Plausible Deniability: Touch around the shoulder or waist, touch on the forearm.

>""What about for men? Touching **is almost always acceptable for women, but can get men in hot water real fast.**

No way researcher-kun! Really? Maybe your next study should be about who's responsible for pushing blatant double standards ( Hint: It's not the homosexual demographic ) , but then you won't be able to publish it, will you? So to summarize, don't forget to keep all of this in mind whenever some woman attempts to justifies *any* kind of criticism or punishment simply because someone dared to touch her arm. It's the same deal with 'creepiness', 'objectification' and bluntness, which is what I started my collection about - Wanna know which 'creepy' acts exist that women *haven't* seen fit to pull on Chads and then brag all over SexPositive, TrollX, AskWomen, GoneWildStories, and StupidSlutsClub about? Literally none. 80% of women are doing whatever they deem 'inappropriate' or 'dehumanizing' or 'too desperate' to hot guys they don't know, have no rapport with, and never established consent with a thousand times over, and evidence is plentiful."
1305,upvote this blackpill
1306,That is so bad because he looks like a normie tbh.
1307,Imagine having a mental breakdown because somebody touched your shoulder. This dude is probably autistic and had no bad intentions when trying to talk to her and doesn‚Äôt deserve jail time tf is wrong with our world
1308,Reewood norper
1309,"I'm not even an incel, but this is so messed up. Poor kid, the UK is absolutely fucked. I remember seeing that article of a 6 year old being charged with sexual assault for hugging and kissing a female classmate. White men are absolutely under attack in today's society, and nobody gives a damn. I hope he gets the charges dropped."
1310,Im just wondering. Why is a 17 yo in college?? Wtf
1311,"That sucks but keep in mind this is the UK where people get imprisoned for any trivial offense.

Kid looks handsome but also a touch of asperger's, if he were NT he'd be Mr Chad himself."
1312,He should have just run JBW
1313,"It does unfortunately depend on the girl and the specific situation

No such thing as a ""sure safe thing"" for all situations in our lives

I grabbed random girls' butts a few times in my life but I never had to suffer any negative legal consequences.  

But then again there were multiple times I was ridiculed, and/or yelled at, even if I did not put my hand on a girl at all

And I am an incel."
1314,Is this real? JFL society is finished
1315,That is terrible. Meanwhile they let the invaders conduct their business as usual with no interference. That is one society that fucking hates White men. Maybe they have guilt over their conquests over the centuries.
1316,"well it is terrible advice to try to put your arm round 17yo girl's waist, let's be honest here.  unless there is more to it then sentence does seem disproportionate on first reading.  But it's not unreasonable to be upset by stranger approaching you a second time and escalating like that."
1317,He's a mentalcel.
1318,"I mean, maybe that's an overreaction, but I think it is good to just not touch someone without their explicit consent anyway, regardless of whether you will face any negative consequences over it or not. It just seems like the respectful thing to do, don't touch someone unless they tell you to. And there's various issues with guys being overly handsy with girls, in ways they'd rarely do with fellow guys"
1319,And this is exactly whats wrong with this world.
1320,I mean if you touch someone in inappropriate places in a sexual way I'ven if it is intentional you should get some punishment for it I don't think he should get harsh punishment but some form of punishment is probably deserved
1321,Wow
1322,"I can't really say that this isn't bad, because it very much so is quite horrible. But if it's anything to him if he can get out of this, I'm sure this guy will have the sympathy of quite a large amount of people and hopefully it will help him to interact and socialize with new people.

Hopefully everything works out for him."
1323,Just imagine what would‚Äôve happened if the guy was attractive xD
1324,This is sad
1325,This is why I don't follow pickup artists' advice. They say you should be an alpha male and touch women. But I'm afraid of getting into trouble like him.
1326,He‚Äôs not ugly so this isn‚Äôt a problem with appearance who the fuck approaches random women and tries to grab their hands LOL
1327,IT idiots will not touching this
1328,Man touches underaged stranger
1329,Weird kid tried to grab boob. Seems like pretty straightforward stuff.
1330,"He touched a girl's waist who he hardly knew. This is not ""making friends""."
1331,"For one part, the UK has gone nuts with the laws regarding socialization, what he did was bad, but no for beign thrown to a court.

For the other, what do you expect from touching a stranger? There's no amount of inexperience that justifies it."
1332,"It‚Äôs his own fault, I don‚Äôt feel sorry for him. don‚Äôt touch people."
1333,Why would a 19 year old adult want to be friends with a 17 year-old minor??
1334,Dont cope. She could have lied but if you are so autistic that you touch someone you just met then you deserved to be jailed
1335,Apparently he could receive a potential sentence as Amber guyger the convicted murderer lol. It's probably because he's a male. If a chick did this to a guy he probably wouldn't even bother telling it to a friend because it's so boring.
1336,"It's the UK. Ours is not a nation of sensible laws. We nearly jailed a man over teaching his dog to do a Nazi salute as a joke. We jail hundreds of people every year for offensive tweets. We have police units who do nothing but browse social media looking for people causing offense, yet apparently not enough money to put police on the streets while London is in the middle of a stabbing and acid attack crisis."
1337,I don't see how anyone could read this article and logically conclude that he deserved this.
1338,"I guess they‚Äôre going off the basis that he touched a girl without her consent, claiming it‚Äôs sexual assault/harassment. Even though this contact wasn‚Äôt sexual in nature ü§°"
1339,"NPCs: why don't you just try to act normal instead of isolating

Also NPCs: HOW FUCKING DARE YOU TRY MAKING A FRIEND GO BACK TO YOUR HOLE"
1340,"If anything, it's actually going to make it easier for her to get in: she can claim extenuating circumstances, which will make tutors and staff look upon her application with some sympathy. I wouldn't be surprised if that's what she's trying to do by telling the court she's been traumatised."
1341,Lmao!!!!
1342,ü§°üåè
1343,0 people on the jury cared how his life has been effected
1344,he didn't just talk tho did he
1345,"Damn, I‚Äôm not even autistic and I have looked this up before. My life is a complete joke. A comedy, one might say."
1346,I‚Äôve looked this up too lmao I‚Äôm def not autistic is just lonely as shit
1347,"It never begun, and never will."
1348,"It‚Äôs really amazing how socially incompetent some autists can be, especially the ones who try to be social but can‚Äôt comprehend how strange they are. 

If you‚Äôre an autist it‚Äôs better to just shut the fuck up and get on with your work."
1349,F
1350,"I know. I have tried for years, they should really make just going away easier and painless."
1351,"Not so irrational.

1352,No joke.. I know one staying with his mom earning minimum wage.. meantime I have to better myself before even daring to look at a girl.
1353,I just heard the other day about a 50 year old fucking a 20 year old girl but the autistic kid trying to make a friend is the problem right?
1354,I literally asked a classmate after hanging out with her for a few months if I could hug her because she was sad and she said yes. Then when I went in for the hug she moved away and was creeped out.

Why do some guys get away with touching thousands of women"
1356,"Shockingly high, like 3x that of women at least."
1357,"bollox my dear, if you read further rather than the Daily Fail in his own words he didn't talk to her.  This is NO WAY making the same move as a so-called alpha male.  Even alpha males don't do this.  This report gives his perspective as well as her's ... read his carefully and tell me honestly that you'd be entirely comfortable with a man doing this to you.  This isn't being in the wrong because he's romantically unsuccessful, it's being in the wrong because he put his arm round the waist of a complete stranger without speaking a word to her.  I do feel charge and sentence is excessive though.  But don't pretend it's a double standard!  It clearly isn't.

1358,"So traumatising, poor girls üò¢"
1359,A person who wasn't autistic would get a haircut before going to court.
1360,"He looks 100% incel.

Not a normie."
1361,"Based on the mention of Oxford University in the article, I'm guessing this is a British kid. The British school system works differently to America's.

Nursery is Kindergarten and is a preschool environment.

Kids start primary school at around 4 years old, and this goes from Reception to Year 6, though sometimes schools are split between infants (R - Y3) and junior school (Y4 - Y6)

Years 7 to 11 are secondary school and go up to when someone is 16 years old. 

A Levels (AS and A2) are generally done in sixth form and go between 16 and 18 years old. When I was studying, this stage was not mandatory. Sixth form is often referred to as college in the UK while university is either called that or 'uni' for short.

A decade ago, the minimum age to legally leave school was raised to 17, meaning AS Levels are effectively mandatory."
1362,She could of been a high school student doing half of her day in college. Lots of hs now do that and kids graduate with an AA.
1363,applying for a place
1364,Thats true. Possibly if she was older she might have acted more maturely?
1365,Hm? I was 17 when I started university
1366,Especially unattractive men. If this happened to me I wouldn't think anything of it. If I was the girl I'd just laugh it off to be honest. Some people are just weird and who knows what goes through their heads. That's why I was never a people person and never will be.
1367,"BULLSHIT. White men are the most preferred by women in the dating market. The very same women who claim to hate white men on social media, actually have a sexual fetish for white men in real life. Check out the subreddit r/JustBeWhite to find out more about that. The real victims of hypergamy are South Asian and East Asian men."
1368,Invaders?
1369,Invaders?

1371,">It just seems like the respectful thing to do

Maybe, but you can't get anywhere with girls like that.

EDIT: I mean it is demonstrating low mate value through low self-confidence.  Of course, false confidence is dangerous, as in the OP."
1372,You should go to jail for touching a girl on the arm and waist?
1373,"You basically said nothing except ""Good luck to him"" in long long sentences"
1374,This is bad until hand-grabber isn't chad
1375,IT will argue that this was literal rape.
1376,"Wow, a girl's boobs are on her arms and waist, interesting."
1377,unless he is Chad
1378,Did you just touch my arm?
1379,I can see the waist as being a little to close and only chads can touch it on the first encounter but the arm is completely fine imo. If we didnt live in a clown world
1380,[deleted]
1381,"As someone on the spectrum myself, this kind of attitude towards people with developmental disabilities offends me."
1382,If a chick did this to a guy the guy would also go to jail LMAO
1383,He is a white heterosexual Christian male
1384,"Yeah it's really sad how much London has gone downhill over the recent years. Knife murders through the roof and yet the police is up in arms over ""transphobic"" tweets. Feel sorry for you guys over there"

1386,"I can't even justify this level of punishment with contact that was ""sexual in nature"". If a woman wanted to touch a man with intents that were ""sexual in nature"", she wouldn't be going to jail. Worse case she gets her hand pushed away and told to leave."
1387,Much is wrong on this world.
1388,Chad only
1389,He wouldn't have touched her arm or waist if he hadn't tried to talk to her.
1390,I have my broken family and horrendous childhood to blame. I've improved myself in recent years.
1391,"First I thought it was a tragedy, too"
1392,"yes you are, stop kidding yourself."
1393,"I agree poor autist was trying too hard to 'fit in'. The incident was completely blown out of proportion, now his dismal life is even harder as he probably has to register as a sex offender. No mercy for the disadvantaged."
1394,"Cash, my friend, change everything..."
1395,"It‚Äôs because he was already a legal adult and she was still a minor. But yeah on a morality level it‚Äôs fucked up. They are both very close in age and they shouldn‚Äôt have made it a big deal. But the girl over reacted and wanted to press charges. Now the poor kid will have to face jail time, have a criminal record, and be a registered sex offender. His life is literally fucking over. Finding a job will be impossible now. If he didn‚Äôt have autism and was a Chad this wouldn‚Äôt be happening. But yet sugar daddies who are 40, 50, 60, and sometimes even 70 are fucking 18-22 yr old girls who are old enough to be their daughters or granddaughters. I know they are technically legal adults but morality wise it‚Äôs fucked up and sick. They are basically pedophiles in the closet and they use the Excuse that they are ‚Äúlegal.‚Äù Poor kid though, I hope he at least have parents who care about him and will help him get out of this situation"
1396,"She did want a hug, just not from you."
1397,"Plenty of mainstream outlets claim they want to listen to men...and that men should open up. 

The sad truth is that when they do open up - they're facing exactly the same criticisms, stigmatisations and 'downgrading' of their problems which make them shut off in the first place."
1398,[deleted]
1399,In this case looking autistic is a good thing. It's probably his defense
1400,Fair point

1402,"I went on an interview once (granted in 2008) but the hr girl had her hand on my lower back while showing me around the building. She rubbed it too.

 Now think about this...I was wearing an expensive suit, smelling nice and all, but would you do that to a woman? I'm sure you would be arrested, even if you were attractive."
1403,"No this is not contradictory.

White people hate their own kind.
Ethnic people admire white people."
1404,I call bullshit bro. I'm white and haven't found other nationalities here any 'easier'. Most of them that rave about white men just want a green card or just to get out of their 3rd world shit hole country. If they have access to tinder they will of course go for the tall chads. Also most of the nationalities I've been with were white. Also Indian and Asians have a better chance sticking within their own race. I've seen many Asian couples and Indian couples.

1418,yeah.  don't touch anyone you don't know esp not putting your arm round someone's waist ... esp not a 17yo girl.  not sure punishment fits the crime tho unless there is more to it.  it's really an invasive thing to do

1424,in the context of whyayeman's comments it is.

That's what i'm arguing against.  he's saying it would be ok if chad did it - i'm saying don't kid yourself it's not ok.  issue over whether men are treated more severely than women for the same offence is a worthwhile one and one i have time for.  but the case here isn't an example of double standards for experienced/inexperienced people

1427,I can relate to this at the hairdressers. A woman was touching me inappropriately but I just brushed it off. Was awkward getting a boner in a chair tho so I told her I just need a minute before getting up. Had a gay guy kiss me at a party and I'm not even gay and was with my girlfriend lol I just laughed it off. It's true though unattractive men are the most at risk. Women don't even have to worry about this nonsense and can freely just be themselves and act how they feel.
1428,"that's not appropriate at all.  should've called her out on it, otherwise these people will keep doing it"
1429,"Many white SJWs are actually closeted racists. I have a German friend who's studying for a master's degree here in Chile. Even though she's left-leaning, she prefer her own kind when it comes to breeding. When I told her that her younger brother should come to Chile ‚Äúto meet a Chilean girlfriend‚Äù, she couldn't hide a slight face of disgust. Check out the YouTube channel of Saint Hamudi. He's a Syrian refugee who lives in Germany since 2011. No German woman has ever been sexually interested in him."
1430,"Dude! I'm a Chilean so I can assure you that women here in Latin America have a strong sexual preference for European men, particularly those with nordic appearance. Remember that the vast majority of male celebrities are white men, so they also benefit from perceived higher status. But, of course, if you're a very low-tier white men ‚Äìat the bottom of your race in terms of looks‚Äì you won't benefit from this."
1431,">I get bombarded with enough ugly looking ethnics holding hands with decent white girls

As Saint Hamudi says, they're outliers. And from what I've seen, white girls choose those who are most sexually dysmorphic: The taller ones, those with broader shoulders, etc. Some ethnics, such as Indians working in STEM, are betabuxers (which is the case of most men anyway)."
1432,"Lmao, what a cuckservative. Alt rightcels, out!"
1433,"Lmao, shut the fuck up, Boomer."
1434,What religion says to have sex with children?? You are so fucking racist it's unbelievable.

1437,"I agree.  You can't screw up with women if you don't interact with them.  Don't touch them, talk to them or interact with them in any way.  It's just for the best."
1438,"There were cases of sports chads getting accused of rape. Probably best to buckle down on your studies in college and forget women. Some women could just detest men, maybe even after the fact."
1439,"You also got an awkward boner when the gay kissed you. It‚Äôs ok to get boners like that, it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre gay."

1444,I don't feel celebrated bro. Where are these women who worship white men? I'm missing out. Yes and being short does not help either way. When they talk about white men they talk about tall good looking Chads. But I'm sure they will even bang Arabs as long as they are hot and tall. Some white guys prefer Asians some black guys prefer Asians. It's a mixed bag bro.

1449,"They should for behaving like that!  even if called out laughingly - 'a man doing what you just did would be reported!'  nothing will change if women are not called out for their double standards in the workplace.  even if all you achieve is to make them think for a second, that otherwise they would not have done"
1450,"Have you ever heard the concept of **VIRTUE SIGNALING**? That's exactly what those women are doing. Saint Hamudi talks about that [in this video starting from the minute 8:56](https://youtu.be/S4RynhpuX1k?t=536):

>White leftist women want refugees welcomed here and try to say ‚Äúwe love refugees‚Äù and ‚Äúwe love diversity‚Äù... But if it comes to fucking or to get pussy, they don't want the Abdul from Syria or the ugly African sandnigger. They want white people. That is the truth. Nobody want ethnics. 

I know he's right from personal experience. I'm a Chilean mestizo. Two years ago, I met a German girl one year younger than me who came to study for a master's degree in my city. She rented a room in my apartment for over a month. Although we became friends, she felt sexually repulsed by me. She ended up becoming friends with benefits with a Chilean man of **GERMAN-DESCENT** 10 years older than her. He's blonde, tall, broad-shouldered and muscular."
1451,"> Where are these women who worship white men? I'm missing out.

In Latin America and East Asia. You need to travel abroad.

> When they talk about white men they talk about tall good looking Chads.

Remember that the average height is shorter over here, so a man who's average in Europe and North America could be considered tall by Latin American and East Asian standards.

> But I'm sure they will even bang Arabs as long as they are hot and tall.

That's true. The heightpill beats the racepill. You're right in that being white is not enough. The advantage that white men have in the international dating market derives mainly from the fact that white men tend to be taller on average than other ethnic groups."
1452,No we don't believe in that. Did you wonder why it made the news? Because it's wrong and shocking! Now explain to me how this equals those damned invaders screwing your precious children or that it's somehow in our religion to screw children. We actually do have laws on marriage and l am a Sunni Muslim not Shia.
1453,You are going to ignore the part where it's banned meaning illegal huh? Well you spin it however you want. I heard you Jews fuck kids too. Look there's Epstein and everyone knows that doctrine means nothing. He was a Jew and fucked kids therefore you are a pedophile too.
1454,"Of course it's silliness but this is the world we live in.  It's extreme but I've never gotten in trouble for not interacting with women.  At this point, there is no reason to fix what is not broken."
1455,Yeah they will definitely fuck for a better quality of life. Bring them over to a first world country and once they have access to tinder then all the sudden you're not that hot. It all depends on what they can get where they are. Travelling abroad isn't my cup of tea and never will be. We get the same thing here in Australia . We get lots of backpackers from Irish and Swedish decent who clean up when they arrive. Lots of Australian girls here have a preference for Irish men now.
1456,"Not so much the point about child marriage. My point is with the Brits-
who are throwing the book at this guy for touching an adult woman, let things like that slide because they don't want to look racist to that sect who does that. There were cases in the news of grown men taking advantage of very young girls in England, and the law turned a blind eye. They weren't Jewish or Christian either. 

It may be wrong and shocking to the western world but they seem to be fine with it. I'm sure it is not everyone, but they seem pretty proud of what they do."
1457,"The man making this statement seems (maybe not) to be a religious representative of the community. It seems the government is the one prohibiting this terrible thing, but the core religion (or some crazy sickos) seems to be ok with it. 

As for Jews, yes, there is scripture condoning ""marriage"" with girls at very young ages (even younger than stated). I don't believe they consummate though until they are older, but the idea being the woman has no say in the marriage.
Obviously today no one does that.

Epstein is far from an example of the Jewish community, where merely touching a woman that isn't your wife comes with very major ramifications, if you believe."
1458,"Non-white girls from 1st world countries such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong also have a strong preference for white men."
1459,"I assume you mean a 17 year old minor that he touched against her will and physically assaulted her under the law. Of course you were there and heard all of the evidence from this ""grown woman"". You were also there for the cases of these very young girls? You saw the court permissible evidence and determined that the court did not want to look racist? You now know these child molesting pedophiles to know they seem proud? How exactly did they show you they were proud? I will assume for the sake of argument that you can link me these stories of these men looking smugly at the camera holding up signs of guilt and looking proud.  Otherwise you're another racist. Isn't that cute that it shouldn't be assault for a white kid, but damn those invaders you never met either. Totally not racist. Believe all women, but only if he isn't white! How does that work in your head?"
1460,Our governments are based on Sharia law aka the Qur'an. Rape is not okay. It's punished by death. In Islam you can not force a woman to marry you or purchase a wife from her father or anyone else. That is rape and always had been. It was never allowed in Islam. You're spouting racist bullshit again.
1461,"They have a preference for white CHADS. Not white men. If I went to any of those countries I guarantee I wouldn't get a single girl. But, then again, why would i? A part of the reason we are in this mess is because people wont stay in their lane."
1462,I don't see it here. And I live in a multicultural country. I see Asian couples that's it never mixed.
1463,"There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that the UK does not pursue persecuting ""refugees"" in their country, especially if anything is religious based. Many EU countries make exceptions for child marriage. 

17 is actually totally legal in NYS. I don't make the laws, and I'm not saying what he did is 100%, but the punishment should fit the crime. 10years and a sex offender registry is probably a minimum punishment for rape, and people get much less even doing that.

 There was a case here where a teacher slept with a student (actually a lady teacher) and the whole case was if it happened a few days before he was 17 or after :lol:. If it was after the cops said it is waste of our time. I think it got thrown out because they could never determine the date."

1465,"Yep  Now that everyone has a smartphone there will be no place left on earth to take advantage of statusmaxxing. The only places left are tribal villages, and some African areas. Chad will make his way into there. The only place left will be that island off the coast of India that kills missionaries if they try to go there. Imagine if an incel made it to that island. He would be seen as a god and would have his choice of the beautiful island women. Sure you‚Äôd have to learn their language. But you would live a life of enjoyment for the rest of your days with a woman who adores and loves you. Bliss. Utopia."
1466,Legal age for consensual sex doesn't mean old enough to touch against her will. He did it twice and she ran away both times. He didn't speak. He only touched a strange girl and your defense is that she's old enough to fuck? He assaulted her the second time knowing she wanted nothing to do with him. She said he was smirking. It was also in a secluded area that he waited for her. That is not the same as oh they arrested him for touching her arm. Once again not being able to prove a crime doesn't justify another person doing it. Stop with bullshit excuses for bullshit behavior.
1467,"Please continue to criticize people based on your racist beliefs, but you look stupid as hell attempting to do that when you don't know the difference between no and know. Just lol. The actions of individual men in society does not mean Islam supports it."

1472,"Hi guys Chad here, don't worry about being ugly. Just be yourself, that's what I do."
1473,The only people who say looks don't matter are attractive people
1474,"Funny - he's correct but not in the way he probably means.

Incorrect: ""95% of girls don't care if you're unattractive,"" meaning your appearance won't affect how open they are to talking with you or their first impression of you. They'll treat you nicely if you treat them nicely, they'll respect you if you respect them, etc. This is likely how the fucking Chad in the thumbnail means it.

Correct: ""95% of girls don't care if you're unattractive,"" meaning they don't care about YOU if you're unattractive. They won't talk to you, acknowledge you, give you the time of day. You aren't even on their radar unless either they need someone to take out their ""problems"" on, or you force them to by talking to or interacting with them - in which case they will either make fun of you, be afraid of you, claim harassment or rape, or all three."

Divorce:

> A year after the wedding Ziegel and Kline divorced. The reason for the divorce, according to them, was Kline's inability to accept Ziegel's horrible disfigurement, and her old flame from the time when Ziegel was deployed.

Death:

> In early May 2013, after an investigation of Ziegel's death, Peoria County Coroner Johnna Ingersoll said that death was caused by alcohol and drug intoxication, not by the fall...The cause of death, according to Ingersoll, was the combination of these substances. Coroner's jury acknowledged that Ziegel's death was a suicide.

You know those early summer days as a youngster when everyone's walking around outside so you bump into people who make you smile? Turn that dial up so that every day is stuffed with pleasant surprises and mysteries, and you yourself are the sun that makes the girls wear lighter clothing and look their best. You could b this chick magnet drawing everyone you like together in common projects. F, brocels

even just to be able to make women laugh so much like Chads do..everything I succeed in is just because law and USD have made things so formal and understandable.

Because a guy asked for her phone number (or social media, whatever) she acted like her life was in danger?

GTFO with that shit. A guy thought you were attractive and was interested in going out with you. And you cry that YOUR LIFE WAS IN LITERAL DANGER?

STUPID FUCKING BS. Polite, gentle rejection is one thing, but this kind of reaction is WAY OVERBLOWN. 

A guy thinking a girl is cute and wanting her to go out with him on a date does not automatically equal him being a serial killer rapist or something.

For all I know, he was just a shy, troubled guy (based on her age I assume he was her age, so MAYBE 18?) just trying to work up the courage to ask someone he‚Äôs attracted to out, trying to break out of his shell, and your reaction is LITERALLY ‚ÄúI RAN FOR MY LIFE, I WAS SO SCARED!‚Äù

Absolutely illogical, what has the world come too???

More and more young guys are going to end up here because of shitty attitudes like this, girls immediately telling you ‚ÄúFUCK NO YOU‚ÄôRE SO FUCKING UGLY!‚Äù or ‚ÄúOMG! HE ASKED FOR MY NUMBER! KILLER RAPIST! HELP ME!‚Äù is going to create more and more incels, and cause more and more suicide (and for some guys who are pushed a little too far, terrorism, like shootings and bombings, no sanity left in their minds, it‚Äôs all over the news/media in recent and current history!).

This is beyond women not being interested in men because their standards are artificially made unrealistically high, this is human empathy disappearing, and it‚Äôs really sad and scary."

1630,"I had this happen when I was at university, and the first time I noticed it, I laughed out loud.  I was a bit older than most of the students so I‚Äôd had social experience out in the real world and never had anyone anyone treat me so rudely.  If you‚Äôre still in your college years, just remember that most of the women in these universities are incredibly immature.  The type who do this aren‚Äôt very bright and seem to think they‚Äôre little princesses.  I assume you‚Äôre in the US?  It‚Äôs just a bad culture here.  The women in these universities have been puffed up by their bourgeois parents, have no experience outside of that bubble and think it‚Äôs okay to be rude to perfect strangers.  The girl who tried this with me first got up to use the restroom after I‚Äôd sat down to study.  I got up shortly after for some water and passed her on the way back.  She gave me the dirtiest look, but I simply smirked in return and gave her a little shoulder check to let her know her behavior had no effect on me.  I returned, sat down completely unperturbed and returned to my studies, completely ignoring her.  She got up in a huff and left shortly after.

You don‚Äôt have to let these people make you feel bad about yourself.  Don‚Äôt hate them, but let them know this sort of thing has no effect on you.  You‚Äôre at school to enrich your mind and improve your lot in life, and it‚Äôs completely unacceptable to be subjected to this sort of abuse.  That‚Äôs what it is.  You need to have some courage and assert your right to be present.  I think this is probably what a lot of women refer to when they mention ‚Äútoxic masculinity.‚Äù  For most men, if they don‚Äôt assert themselves, they open themselves up to this sort of behavior.  If you cultivate an air of completely not caring what anyone thinks of you, it helps a lot in dealing with these situations."
1631,"This is so often the case I find anybody who isn‚Äôt a guy that comes up and talks to me with complete aversion.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôm sitting here still a lonely depressed virgin. There are legit girls throwing around pussy and sleeping with anyone at university, but they still won‚Äôt sleep with me or give me a chance. 

People won‚Äôt even ask me for help in my classes. I‚Äôm literally ranked #1 right now in my class. I have a perfect 4.0 GPA as of the end of last semester. I have 3 more semesters to go before I‚Äôm done, but just need to get 3 more perfect GPA semesters and I will have officially graduated at #1 in my class, at the #1 University for my major in the country. 

Seems like a decent accomplishment for an incel. I‚Äôm not giving up yet, and I will NEVER forget how people treated me on my journey to success. I will never let people use me or walk over me. I will instead use my wealth and resources to exact a reasonable revenge."

1670,"Yes to the latter. Personality is starting to not matter. The guise of religion and monogamy is falling apart and humans are starting to realize that marriage isn‚Äôt so sacred, and women are starting to learn that they can live a much happier and sexy life by sleeping with who they please."

Where do you suggest they go?

1675,"Sure dude, because I would go into a place and hurt people that have done nothing to me and scar them for life.

Neither of which is true. I just think its sad how young people get sucked into this mindset. I wish there was more we could do for them. 
And also, not all girls are like this. Most girls aren‚Äôt like this. Especially after high school. She‚Äôs just an insensitive selfish whore and her self worth is based on surface level compliments from horny teenage guys.

1744,"OK but that's the system. it sucks . i hate the system. i hate that we have an ancap style SMP. it's gay.

idk, maybe i have an unorthodox viewpoint here. 

but i think a blackpill means there's no hope. it's not when we get hit by the world and our feelings get hurt. and it does hurt. no shame there.

a redpill is when you see how the system works, and then you can do something about it. i'm not a TRP guy but i do recognize there is an anger phase."

I'm at the bottom of the fucking barrel right now, and today is the day that I change that."" Learn something new, go to the gym, pick up a new hobby until you find something you enjoy, go outside! These days it has never been easier to learn new shit for free and find ways to talk to others, thanks to the internet (though, thanks to recent events you can't really go outside. Oh well.)

When you lose a game, you dont stare at the ""you died"" screen for eternity,you go again. And again,and again again,until you win. Life is just full of these awful bumps and holes you gotta get by, but you avoid the obstacles to win the race. You practice and learn,through trial and error and through books and shit, and you win the race because you decided to prepare. Of course some person who's been waking up at 4am to train all day for the race has a higher chance than some person who sits in their house all day, imagining how they could win the race if they got up and did shit."

This isn‚Äôt just IT, this is all of normie soy Reddit. One of the refreshing things I found when I started posting in incel and right-wing spaces is that I didn‚Äôt have to put an ‚Äú/s‚Äù at the end of every sarcastic comment to avoid getting downvoted.

If you're being ironic and would actually date femcels, go find some in your area. If they don't want to date you, you can pull a ""Well you're not really involuntarily celibate then!"" on them which should be quite satisfying to you, right? If they do want to date you and you two get along well, I suppose you're no longer an incel.

If you're being sincere, uhm...Well you're not really involuntarily celibate then!

Oh, and by the way, by ""date femcels"" I obviously mean ""date any femcel that is willing to, not a specific femcel that you find attractive"". I'm not saying that all femcels are consistent in their logic."

1958,"For most people, the goal is to find one (1) person who they like to bond with and form a relationship with. If you‚Äôre poly, it might be multiple people. What other people are doing to date has nothing to do with you and the people you meet. You form your friendships and relationships and whatever and you live your life."
1959,"But if you've found someone to bond with, that's one less person available for someone else to bond with, so it's zero-sum. If you succeed at your goal, someone else will find it harder to succeed at theirs. Why would you not frame this in terms of competition?"

1980,Why would they date a family member though?
1981,"How does one respond to something like that?

How does a parent relate to a child going through something that they do not understand.

The term incel has been poisoned. Just like feminism, pride and men's rights.

Have you talked to your parents about challenges you face?

I've said this before and will again. All relationships can be hard. Familial, sexual, romantic, etc.

What are the challenges you face today with dating?

Edit parents above should have read family."
1982,"Usually family members dont ever think about each other in a romantic way.  
Thats probably why they were bamboozled by your question.  
They are probably projecting themselves onto you so it is unclear to them why you have problems with finding dates, since they don't know the contex. 

I can't imagine your answer cleared anything up and it probably confuzed them."

I LMAO at the gatekeepers who claim you ""gotta have dating experience to be a MGTOW"".  Such bullshit.  The problems in the dating game are so bleeding obvious today that even a kissless virgin can see it.  You can learn a lot just from outside observation, and the guy who learns from OTHERS' mistakes is a lot smarter than the guy who has to actually go through it before waking up.

I don't think you understand what ""following the other sheep"" means. If everyone is breathing, you have to breathe. If every employer needs a college degree, you have to get a college degree to get employed. ""following the sheep"" would mean trying to betabux an old, overweight female with absurdly high bodycount, which no incel is currently doing. Given that you're on an incel subreddit, I think it is safe to assume you don't have money, connections or power to implement the large scale societal changes that you wish to implement.

Men who are overweight, but also muscular and tall with an attractive face, can still get some attention from women with low sexual market value

2381,">Which is impossible, considering procriating is one of the most important parts of the human life.

It‚Äôs not at all impossible. There are plenty of important things in life and hardly anyone gets to have everything they want. Being a parent can be accomplished via adoption and incels who are the least likely to ever get a girlfriend can still have loving relationships with friends and family. These relationships if cultivated enough can make up for the lack of romance and sex enough to find a level of happiness worth living for. Gratitude for what we do have is one of the best ways to feel better about what we don‚Äôt have. Life can be a lot worse than not having sexual or romantic relationships.

>You expect a place full of sad, depressed people to NOT be toxic? Stop being so out of touch, this is natural when you deal with a shitty situation, like the one we are.

There are plenty of support groups full of sad and depressed people which aren‚Äôt toxic. I get why it can devolve into that but that doesn‚Äôt mean it should stay that way. The community can and should improve to be a better influence on its members so that it can actually help them as much as possible rather than keeping them down with negativity."

And men who are sub 8 get left in the dust, even if you are tall like me. 

IT and lefties always say men care more about looks than women do but I find this untrue. This lady who used to visit a bar I frequent almost separated with her husband because he gained too much weight. This thot I am friends with on Facebook only wants guys with big cocks regardless of how nasty they are to her.

Why do they call us misogynists when they are the ones who proclaim women are a magical species that have transcended the bounds of human nature and all of a sudden no longer care about looks? They're the ones putting pussy on a pedestal, not us. Women are still human beings and humans are a very superficial species. Visit a major SoCal city like Los Angeles if you don't believe me how much big cock and six pack abs women chase after. I've been there. If you're not a male model material there you're fucked. Lucky for me I live in the heroin and meth riddled Mid Atlantic states where most people are pretty average/ugly looking.

   I‚Äôm not saying all women have it easy as I bet many do not from the femcel forums I‚Äôve browsed but I feel like generally speaking being male is a handicap.."
2407,"It's really logic when you understand how they think : when they talk about ""men"", they talk about Chads, because other men literally don't exist in their eyes. So when they say ""it's hard to get a boyfriend"", that mean it's hard to get a Chad."
2408,Yeah but women have higher standards than men do you know how hard it is trying to get a girlfriend or get laid when you‚Äôre unattractive and Introverted it‚Äôs practically impossible a man would be more likely to give a not so attractive woman a chance for her personality can‚Äôt say the same for women if you‚Äôre not at least an 8/10 you never had a chance to begin with
2409,This is hilarious as I know chicks in real life who are butt ugly with tall good looking boyfriends. Not only that but these chicks have some of the worst personalities I've seen.
2410,"This is why I don't approve of women on incel spaces, post like this make it clear they have no idea what they're talking about and the disconnect between the two groups is too wide to possibly bridge and have a conversation"
2411,Do all of them get WHO they want? No. A lot of them have a hard time getting who they really want but still have tons of guys wanting them. It's just that them guys ain't up to their standards.
2412,So that was a fucking lie
2413,It WAS as hard before the internet. Before the internet guys were mysterious and aloof but now they flood girls with online messages it's completely different believe me.
2414,Anyone else noticing the awards? LOL. Men literally fall in love with women when they don't even know what they look like. That's how powerful the internal desperation SIMP structure is.

2418,"See here's the thing right? A girl just has to go on OkCupid and she has a selection of men to chose from. Tinder? Same thing.

I'd be LUCKY to get a match that isn't a bot and half the time she won't respond or just unmatch me in an hour or two.

So if I made an average girls POF OKC account etc I bet you money I can set up 10 dates within 2 weeks. That's a lot of chances for a boyfriend especially if you are willing to have realistic or average standards.

A guy? Loool good luck going on a date. She's got 10 other guys hitting her up and you're in that pool of 10 dates she can pick from."
2419,"Well, I'm friends with a thot on Facebook who makes it clear that she only wants men who are 6' or taller and have a cock bigger than 5 inches. Then she bitches and moans (non sexually) about how she can't get a boyfriend or sex despite looking like a model. 

I'm regularly seeing more and more thots on the internet these days that state that you must have these requirements as a guy otherwise you're fucked. Then people wonder why red/black/height pill parts of the internet are becoming a thing."

2421,"I mean this is true. Sure she can have sex any day of the week with practically any guy, but getting a boyfriend isn't easy.

2424,"I think even if you believe it‚Äôs easier for girls to get a guy and harder for a guy to get a girl, maybe ask yourself why she needs to be picky in the first place, or if she really is even being picky and doesn‚Äôt just have standards."
2425,"Hi woman here, it isn't as hard, but it isn't easy either. I am friends with a lot of men, and most of them have had more partners than me, hell even my younger brother as a 15 yo. Not to brag, but I am not in the ugly part of the spectrum of girls, I'm around average. But I'm kind of shy and I don't go out and meet new people that often. So I think it really depends on the person, some men are handsome and go out a lot, others stay at home, and others are ugly according to most girls' standards. Same things for women."
2426,"It is easier for us.  
Stop erasing men's lived experiences.  
You don't understand what it's like for them, because you've never tried, and you have no intention of ever doing so.  
You don't care about them. You don't see them as human.  
Stop telling men what they need to understand. Stop trying to control their behavior and their thoughts. Just stop."
2427,It is true girls can get boyfriends easily the reason why you might see a female single would be of two reasons because they have high demands and others just dont want a boyfriend but only want some one to have intercourse with
2428,"And here we go again with the double standards.

It's fine for men to call themselves incels if they can't get a date and, at the same time, have standards (and I'm fine with that, everyone should have standards, makes life easier).

But if a woman says that she's an incel because there's no man that she likes that corresponds her, suddendly she's lying and all that she must do is open ver legs to the first man than want sex with her."

2430,"I don't think women live life on easy mode. I genuinenly think women's lives are harder on average today but when it comes to dating women have it much easier than men, as a matter of fact a lot of the problems that women face today come as a trade off of being able to date so easily. Women are too desired, women attract too many men, women are just too attractive which makes dating so easy for them, they are the selectors for a reason,  but at the same time this puts women at risk of rape, creeps, sexual objectification et similia."
2431,I really wanted to help  the men in this sub. But just being around this victim mentality energy has actually infected me. I had to remind myself that just because I can‚Äôt get laid doesn‚Äôt make me a victim. I feel like I‚Äôve failed but I need to take care of myself. I hope more people with an open mind see‚Äôs past this sub. There‚Äôs nothing to gain from being an incel. I‚Äôm unsubbing. I need to look out for myself. I doubt I‚Äôll be missed. Goodbye incels.

I believe this is the well intended point gentlemen. That just because one is not a male nor ugly does not mean they cannot relate to mistreatment nor dating incompetency. 

I think the value in this is not to discredit the pain or agony of others nor to hold to it that whoever has suffered more egregiously is better than those who have suffered less. The lesson here is that we all suffer and only through shared understanding, empathy and compassion can we go on to recognize unhealthy symptoms occurring in our society and work united to solve them.

You mean transgender. And yes, if a woman within reasonable standards (not drug addicted, relatively close to your age, mentally stable enough for a relationship, etc.) is attracted to you, you are not an incel. 

> But if no one of your ""options"" is able to even create some sexual desire, they're not even options.

You are dismissing romantic love. Say, if your wife had a disfiguring accident that made you no longer sexually attracted to her, would you divorce her? If no, you just proved my point. If yes, cool, you discredited yourself as being able to understand human relationships.

My partner has already created sexual attraction to me, that has been fulfilled, but if she transitioned I would left her inmediately, and I won't start a relationship with someone that doesn't make me desire her.

>Inceldom always has been about lacking both physical AND mental intimacy. If you can have either, you are not an incel. And no, you can only buy sex from a prostitute, not intimacy. Google the definition.

You can't have neither with someone that doesn't have any attractive for you. If someone who is, essentially, sexless at you eyes desire you, that doesn't make you a volcel, because you can't have any healty relationship, of any kind, with that person."

2560,"> I don't see that as something reasonable and healty.

No, being an incel is not a healthy state. But there is no cure either, so you have to make the best of it.

> My partner has already created sexual attraction to me, that has been fulfilled, but if she transitioned I would left her inmediately, and I won't start a relationship with someone that doesn't make me desire her.

Wait, so you say you would never date a trans woman, no matter what she looked like, no matter how much your personalities fit? Thats is incredibly idiotic. Your dick doesn't have a built-in chromosome detector, you know?

> You can't have neither with someone that doesn't have any attractive for you. If someone who is, essentially, sexless at you eyes desire you, that doesn't make you a volcel, because you can't have any healty relationship, of any kind, with that person.

I have definitely developed a crush on a man before, even though I'm very heterosexual. But thats not a concept you would ever have to deal with I guess, you can just find someone for both things at the same time.

2568,"For me, the thing I like about this subreddit is that it's sort of a ForeverAlone replacement that's a bit more blackpilled, but not full on hopeless psycho like Incels and those other forums seem to have been/are. 

I still think there was more of an element to that in Braincels and it made me even more depressed, even if this place feeds the fire for me as well.. But I get less of the ""I hate women"" vibe here, and more of a ""I hate the system and myself"" that I see here. Braincels still had elements of the former IMO, from the very small amount of time I've read things over there."
2569,Us incels never got any luck in life.
2570,It was nice to know there were people going through the same things as me. The feeling of not being the only one really helped me through some of the harder times.
2571,Some of the best and funniest memes iv ever seen plus there's something fascinating about the blackpill that I just can't ignore. Maybe it's because no one ever speaks the real truth that made it addicting

It is virtually impossible to find a community with such a great sense of humour that also shares your pains, experiences and overall worldview.

2639,"Being friends with someone in the hopes that they will date you is a very poor tactic that almost never works. Why? Because you are not only putting yourself in the friend zone by omission, but it comes off as passive and shows a lack of honest and mature communication.  


I once was hit on by some rando on the streets, and was insisting that we hang out over drinks. I was in a relationship, so I politely declined. Then he replies with ""oh but what about as friends?"" To that I said:  ""No. You clearly want to be more than just friends, and this can only end with you becoming bitter and accusing me of leading you on if I don't end up breaking up with my partner. It's also super disrespectful to both my partner and my relationship with him as whole to be friends with someone who is trying to undermine our relationship like that."" The dude was speechless for a few moments, but admitted that I was probably right, we wished each other well and went our separate ways.    


If you are into someone then you need to be honest about it and truthfully communicate it, while it does not guarantee you will get the girl, you'll at at least show that you have the self respect to not put yourself in situations where you are only hurting yourself emotionally."

Wallowing in self-pity doesn't help, but remember very carefully what lead a lot of us to be here in the first place. Trying and just never seeming to get it done. And so eventually you ask what the real problem is. And then you find the data that guys here cite. And you realize that you're expendable.

But if you like the girl, tell her. It's hard and scary but in the end you at least you took action, no matter the outcome it's better to be true to your feelings. Like they say if you want something, you need to work for it and be proactive, not just wait for an opportunity to present it's self."

Instead of being a coward who secretly pines over someone but can't even the person they like that they have feelings outside of the platonic. It's pathetic, because instead of just getting rejected and moving on, the ""Nice Guy"" lives with the delusion that if he is her friend that he can wear her down when she gets sick of chad and the CC, and she'll settle for them. And when the hell has it ever worked?

I know I at least respect the less attractive guys who have the balls to at least tell me what's up, it takes courage and variability.

2. has the ""artist"" spent more than 5 minutes in any incel space? its a generally accepted axiom among incels that fatcel=volcel. this ""incels don't shower lmao"" idea also seems to be a pure projection coming from people with questionable hygienic habits themselves (=IncelTears) , and based on absolutely nothing. it's just another strawman attack to make the incel detractors feel good about themselves and like the world is a just place because incels are obviously so ridiculous they wear dirtied pedo anime tshirts outside."

2744,"As other people said, I think both comics are (kinda) correct. I personally relate more to the right one, but being part of incel subs and chats for a long time, there's definitely a radical and a moderate side to incels"
2745,"The first panel are the black-pilled men and the second panel are the ""tfw no gf"" men. Both are incels.

The principal fault of the first half isn't that the arguer is a strawman. There are plenty of people, like me, who think this way because we are incapable of looking away from reality and lying to ourselves. No, the principal fault is that the argument is a strawman by omission. The problem isn't that women date up, but that what they define as ""up"" is based primarily on things men can't control (e.g., height, face, and dick size). Meanwhile, men tend to have less stringent standards on what they define as ""up"", so the average woman has a more vibrant sex life than the average man.

On the second panel of the first half, when I, and others like me, say it's ""disgusting"", I'm being sarcastic. That shit is actually life fuel for me. But I know that, subconsciously, the vast majority of humanity will think this way, so I'm just echoing their sentiments as part of the joke.

At the same time if you decide to do that, you‚Äôre gonna have to be okay with some of their legitimate criticisms against incels and answer for a few of the shitty things people with the label you‚Äôd be representing have done.

This comic definitely has potential to start a dialogue with IT if you want it to"
2754,"There's incels like both sides. Sure, some people get a little overzealous in assuming the worst, but there's also a lot of legit shitty sorts and we shouldn't just act like they don't exist or are just a tiny irrelevant minority"
2755,"The truth probably lies somewhere inbetween.

Most couples are decently looks- and or life-matched. You wont find a fat ugly neet neeckbeard dating a successful fitness chick and all of us know why. So if one side of the couple is seemingly less attractive, ofc people might think about certain reasons why that is. Especially as a lonely guy there are times where you are sad and angry that this other dude that is similar or even worse looking/fat has a gf and you dont. (I think only very radical incels would think like the 2nd left picture)

About the 3rd pic in my opinion it is a bit laughable how some girls get away with just being ""normal"" while guys / their boyfriends are clearly putting much more work into it but its not something I often think or care about. The typical niceguy/neckbeard stereotype that is shown here is only rarely true and those people deserve to be alone.

People are more than just looks and whenever incels arent depressed/angry we think like the right panels."
2756,"While I know what ""incel"" means I don't think the term itself is used to describe your lot. I'm technically an incel because I'm a virgin and it's not really of my own choice, but when I say someone is an incel I'm saying that they're a pos woman hater who lives in an echo chamber on that incel website (I don't remember what it is) that blames their inability to get a gf/lose their virginity on women and not their own personality"
2757,No seems pretty accurate already.
2758,Tbh seems more accurate to woman hating incels or niceguys not normal lonely people
2759,god i wish that were me
2760,"The left is incel, the right is just a regular loser"
2761,"I see the panels on the left being said by incels on a regular basis

I know that %90 of that is just bitterness and pain

Unfortunately incel spaces legitimize that and turn it into an ""incel religion"" aka the black pill

When people say ""You fucking incel""

They're not talking about virginity

They're talking about your mindset

The panels on the right sound more like FA, the panels on the left = incels"

They would make up that im an incel because i hate women, muh soggy knee, nazi etc.

2771,"incels aren't generally overweight or unattractive, from the range of selfies i've seen.  have yet to see one that meets the stereotype presented here.  they're not arrogant-looking either, most look shy/diffident.  have yet to see one that isn't tbh"

One simple thing I never see brought up on IT:

And then there are many incels who are simply lonely, sad men who want to be in a relationship. They are generally nice people who mean no harm, and I think that most people in IT can't make make distinction."
2791,well a sub for incels themselves are not gonna do that
2792,Because of the loud minority that says horrendous stuff
2793,I'm a IT subscriber and that sub is a reaction to subs like braincels which are extremely hateful and toxic. I think most know not all incels are like that and I try to point this out whenever possible. Lack of nuance is a huge problem on the internet.

2807,"No, they very very rarely point out that not all incels. 

Ive made some comics before and in a few of them I pointed out mental health problems. When they got posted on IncelTears, the reaction was always that the ITers said that the character in the comic who was depressed was also a misogynist fascist child rapist.

This kinda gives off the message that even if youre just identifying As an incel and you arent hateful at all, people will just accuse you of misogyny, rape, pedophilia, fascism, etc. So at this point whats the point in not being hateful, when you get the same treatment either way?

Also even if you exit the incel community, your life can still be ruined if someone finds your old account, even if you havent posted any hateful stuff. (A story like this was posted to IT once, OP was a woman proud of basically destroying his ex boyfriends life based on his old incel account, on wich he havent posted anything hateful)
So Whats the point in leaving than?


The whole attitude IncelTears has towards incels is exactly what traps incels in these spaces where only a very few not pick up the misogynistsic attitude.
And this is a huge problem, because you might say IncelTears isnt that big of a community, but millions of people get the definition of incel from inceltears, automatically making them think ""all incels""

This could be fixed by a stickied post on there addressing that not every incel is misogynistsic.
Im not saying they should promote inceldom or excuse the misogyny, im saying that the generalisation of such a diverse group As incels based on the worst, most delusional posts found on Incel.co isnt really healthy."
2808,"I feel like people who consider themselves Incels by the exact definition of the word, shouldn't call themselves Incels and be part of this community, because it's doomed to be flooded by hate. People hate Incels because of Braincels and similar, not because they are ugly or ""inferior""."

I know this uses a somewhat looser standard, but given that its been long established men tend to lie and say they have more sex than they do (while women lie the opposite way), I think a quarter is a pretty good estimate."
2824,"[Age 18 to 30](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lpPQCfvc6yMX_dmg3r67e7h6Foc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4C7SSBIXSNFCLOJIGCWUOKDYTY.png).

The average age of virginity loss in the US is 17. Given this statistic inherently leads to extremes in the old side (i.e. it is possible for that to happen at 22, or even 32, but nearly impossible at 12), the ""typical"" age would be slightly lower than 17.

I live in the UK, where despite the ""stiff"" stereotypes, university accommodation is a complete sexfest for non-incels, and most people enter at around 18.

Incidentally, I remember reading in another study that in western Europe, the average female at the same age range (18-30) tend to have had at least 10-12 sex partners."
2825,"Fair enough, I didn't know until today that some incels were worth communicating with."

2830,It‚Äôs been found a lot of people who are incels tend to be gay
2831,"""I havent seen a red boat in my life, therefore red boats dont exist""

No, you havent seen a swole incel because actual incels never reveal that theyre an incel because it could easily destroy their life."
2832,"I don't think that's a good statistic. A person who hasn't had sex in the past year is not an incel. An incel is someone who has NEVER had sex and is unable to through normal means. And personally, I think if your below the age of like 24, I don't think you can truly know for sure whether you are an incel or not. You may have a good idea, but there's still a lot of hope being so young. (See below)

Here's a statistic I found- (This is in the US, btw)
https://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/how-many-people-die-virgins-never-have-sex.htm

""Between 12-14% of adults have never had sex between the ages of 20-24""

""Only 5% of people have never had sex between the ages of 25-29""

Notice the huge drop? 

""And around the age 44, only 0.3% report never having sex.""

Personally, I think 25% of all young men being incels is just you huge of a stretch, and just not realistic. BUT in some countries such as Japan, that may be the case. 

""By contrast, in 2010, 25 percent of unmarried Japanese men over the age of 30¬†reported being virgins.""

I'm sure teenage boys might be somewhere around the 25% mark, but I wouldn't call them incels."
2833,"Like, a quarter of young males of involuntarily celibate. Thinking all incels are that hateful stereotype is like thinking all Muslims are jihadists."

2838,"You have a point. Tried looking through the paper that article links and found it says 16% of males 15-44 did not have any partner in the past year.

It doesn't exclude prostitution though. I live in the UK and I suspect the US is also similar in that alcoholism and drug abuse are widespread and also leads to plenty of sexual encounters otherwise not possible ""through normal means""...although at this point I'm starting to think a lot of people consider this normal means..."
2839,"nope, no incel ally will ever post on inceltears"

2842,"If its so noticable than how the fuck is it our misogyny causing our inceldom?

But I know that even if they left each other I have no hope with my crush so instead of seeing her falling in love for someone else again I prefer this situation even if I can't go on like this for long.

The point is that you need to quickly get over with your crush or your existence will get worse. Guys please we need to stay strong and don't let our pain overflow us, even if it stabs like a knife in the chest

3041,"An incel is someone who, no matter how much work they put into themselves and how much effort they put into dating, is statistically extremely unlikely to find a partner.

Let's suppose you're a straight male. If you're average looking, around 1/5 women will find you physically attractive. That's usually enough for normal guys to have a few girlfriends in their life since they have a wide enough network of friends which allows them to talk to girls and build up confidence. When you meet a girl through a friend, that will give you more credit and it's more likely that she will judge you by your personality first, which will raise your chances a little bit. Let's say that 1/4 girls will be into you and you are acquainted with 5-20 girls.

An incel might be a guy who was always bullied or an outcast, for various reasons, which lead up to him having a small circle of friends, if he has one at all, most of which probably are male(cause same sex friendships usually have lower standards). That means he will be acquainted to no girls or, in very rare cases, a couple. If he's average looking, he has a  1/5 chance of a girl liking him for his looks, but we can assume he's not used to flirting, so he'll probably blow up the few chances he gets without realizing it.

That means that the only thing he can resort to is casual and online dating, which is already hard for an average guy, but for an ugly guy with not much flirting skills it's near impossible.

An average looking woman, on the other hand, will be considered reasonably attractive by, let's say, 4/5 guys. Even if a guy doesn't find a girl attractive, he might want to settle for it because most guys don't get many chances and being kind to a normal guy is usually enough for an average girl to bump her chances up. Moreover, girls have stronger friend circles and there's more collaboration among them, which means most average girls will have connections with 10-100 guys.

The closest a girl can get to being an incel is to have no friends and be unattractive. That still means 1/5 guys will probably be into her, which are the chances of an average guy. That means that, with casual and online dating, she has a pretty good chance of finding a match.

Now the real reasons girls say they're incels is A they are ""shy"" (they are cold and show disinterest whenever a guy talks to them) or B they can't get the guy they want (they won't even look for other options so if he rejects them, they're done) or C they want an attractive guy (usually in a high enough league that girls are already flocking to him). These reasons aren't mutually exclusive.

So you can see how women usually create the trouble for themselves.

TL;DR: ""incel"" women are usually doing better than average guys. That's why we consider them volcels"

You also don't really feel attraction the way men do. For us, we will probably be into most girls physically and, if they're nice to us, that's all we need. Women are more picky and very rarely can only use physical attraction as a standard (which in my opinion is often the case for girls being single).

These are all things incels have been talking about for a long time but people won't give us credit just because, well, just as we get bullied in our private lives, we get bullied online.

What most women fail to understand is that it's a hundred times more likely for Chad to be the violent guy and the abusive one, but I think they ignore it because they get so rarely aroused just by the looks of a guy that they can't handle it and it's like their brain becomes instinctive and the danger becomes fun (until they've been with him for long enough to realize how bad the situation is).

You don't just talk to guys who are attracted to you. First of all, at least give them a shot instead of trying to predict if they will like you or not. If they don't but you get along, actually make friends with them and get them to introduce you to their male friends. If your standards aren't Chad level you'll find someone after getting close to at least 10 guys 100%. Also give it time if you're actually unattractive.

>I talk to guys at Meetups. I talk to guys at conventions

Do you get along? Do you text them later? Do you crack jokes at each other and try and meet up? Again, even if it doesn't go well, they probably can introduce you to more people.

Your hypotheticals are fun, but not founded in any actual evidence. If everybody had their own very specific preferences, something like attractiveness would not exist as a concept and the beauty industry wouldn't exist. Just look at how homogenic the ratings on subs like /r/Rateme are.

I recently lost my access to my old uni account, so finding studies to prove my point has become a little harder. The good, old, horribly overused [Tinder article](https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a) is pretty enlightening though.

Because the data is based on Tinder, it is mostly limited to visual attraction. The base result is that men swiped  right on far more women of all attractiveness levels. That clearly proves that men considered way more womens looks to be acceptable.

Because I have had this discussion a few times, I'll just disarm the usual counter arguments in advance to save everyone the time.

* ""Many men swipe right on everybody and then filter out afterwards."" While this is true, this doesn't disprove my point. This strategy only works for men if they would have liked the vast amount of women anyway, otherwise they wouldn't save much time at all.
* ""Maybe women just like every attractiveness level equally, leading to this distortion."" Interesting thought, but this would lead to a noticeable advantage for very unattractive men over very unattractive women, visible as an effect in the lower left corner. And there is no such thing on display.
* ""Tinder means nothing."" Yes, it does - especially when you want to talk about physical attractiveness. I would argue it gives even better data than actual studies, because the participants did not feel observed and under societal pressure.
* ""Tinder is just about hookups."" For pretty much everybody, the first step into a relationship is a hookup, so this is a very relevant metric. Funny enough, I recently saw a study that pointed out that something like 20% of asked couples met on Tinder or a similar app.
* ""Who cares about statistics, you only need to find one person that fits!"" Even conventionally attractive people have huge issues finding permanent partners. And the smaller the dating pool, the smaller the chance of meeting someone like this.

So instead of telling everyone that they will definitely find someone if they just hang in for long enough (just world fallacy), you should accept that millions of people just won't. Thats not great, but you can't fix that. If you want to help, help them finding ways to live with it instead."
3094,">what would you refer to as a hot chick

A 3rd degree burn victim that is obese, toothless, bald and never showers of course. Objective attractiveness has been done several times, and another poster even said you're aware of this which just proves you're arguing in bad faith here.

>maybe shes only hot in your eyes

Thats not objective though, thats subjective. You can delusionally believe the burn victim i described above is a beautiful person but you're deluded if you believe everyone else will agree.

>maybe she writes X in her diary

Thats cute but ""to me"" and ""objectively/to others"" are very different things.

I can both believe that she genuinely thinks this and that shes objectively wrong."

Make the normies pay? Make women pay? Get back at the ""bullies"" who didn't give you a blowjob or coddle your dumbass ideas? 


No the plan is to cope together until accession or death

The difference between incels and normies is, when nobody wants a normie, he just moves on with his life and tries to make it as happy and fulfilling as he can, he doesn't just sit there paralysis-by-analysis bitching and moaning. 

The difference is normies still have hope and look like humans


Women don't want you? All well and good. Go live your life. That's the proper way to handle it mentally and emotionally. Problem is you guys are oversexed and entitled, 

It‚Äôs not good. It sucks

you think society owes you a girlfriend. 

Nope

Well pal, nobody in this world owes you anything, not a hello, not even a reply. You can take that in a bad way. Or you can take that in a good way. 

I agree nobody owes anybody anything but that doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt suck or hurt

Example : I don't owe you a reply, but I just gave you one, that's human kindness and warmth. It's all in how you perceive things.

You‚Äôre a prick

Hey thanks for at least realizing this.  It is indeed something women deal with although there are also women out there who I hope guys figure out  they shouldn't touch with a 20 foot geiger counter whether she is drop dead gorgeous or ugly as hell. (there was a thread here a few weeks ago about a woman who seemed to be fishing for incels and then being completely toxic to them.  It was pretty horrific.)

I have a hard time believing that there is a physical look that is indicative that someone is violent.  Good looking men with crappy characteristics are certainly traps for women (Ugh . . Ted Bundy . . Ugh).  The same could be said of good looking women. 

If you know of any study showing that physical good looks indicate a more violent tendency, I will try to read it with an open mind but I'm am dubious about any outward physical characteristic revealing content of character."

Like... the first time I ever went to a BDSM club, I was shocked at how everyone there looked so normal. I was the youngest one there. And I don't mind telling you that the guy I kept pestering the whole night was at *least* in his 70's. 

I have no idea how to help them find ways to live with it, though. I feel like if I did, that would come off as ten times worse because I'm asexual and aromantic- I don't have that thing inside me that wants to find a mate. I don't have that thing that's causing them so much pain. It would be like a child-free person trying to comfort and infertile person who wants a baby. You know?

3113,Rule 2
3114,">Good looking men with crappy characteristics are certainly traps for women 

This is what I was talking about.

You can get a lot of evidence for that. The most basic for is when on r/tinder (I don't know what they're up to now and don't wanna check) there was the meme among Chads of starting the conversation with ""do you like being chocked?"". If an incel did that they would be reported or if a IT member found out they'd swat his house.

It's kinda sad but some I saw some people trying to start conversations with texts from r/creepypms or saying they're rapists and nazis while using a really handsome profile picture and tons of girls responded saying ""that's ok as long as the sex is good"".

You can also see that with fandoms of shitty celebrities or asshole tv characters or straight up murderers in jail, some girls get even more turned on at the idea that they are the special one who gets the best part of a dangerous man.

It's like women are using a different part of their brain when dealing with hot guys. Again NOT ALL WOMEN but generally speaking, hot guys always get away with more than ugly guys and that means they will have less inhibitions in good and bad ways.

I'm sure there's some study about it on r/blackpillscience, but I haven't visited that sub in a long time and it's late, so maybe I'll pull it up tomorrow.

Either way, I'm not just trying to claim that all Chads are evil, they just get away with more and many girls don't really care, specially in the beginning, so they might get stuck in an abusive relationship.

Incels on the other hand don't really want anything more from a girl than being hugged and being told ""I love you"""
3115,"You just ignored absolutely everything I said. Nice trolling if that was your plan.

>Why can't you just say the same thing for guys?

3116,"Wow. Yes you can and people do..Have you been living under rock? Causal sex is a thing and People do that quite often. Some fuck on the first date, or ONS and Chad can get pussy meeting a chick on the same day. Is it degeneracy? That's up to you, but it's no fault of men solely and it's a shitty thing to blame men entirely here for wanting it. 
Marriage is dying/life support, another thing you seem to have missed and those men running from it have every right to, they aren't avoiding responsibility they are running away from a trap. Most marriages end in the divorce courts where men get divorce raped into obvilion."

It saddens me to hear you also experience problems in dating. A lot of these incels seem to underestimate how difficult it really is for practically anyone. I know a girl that is incredibly gorgeous and thoughtful. Every man she meets is nice to her which sounds great, but she never knows if it‚Äôs who she is they like, or just how she looks. Also she is so beautiful many men will not even approach her. Last time I saw her she was complaining about how lonely she was.

Fun fact by the way, cis-men are usually forbidden from entering BDSM or swinger clubs when they don't bring at least one woman with them. Otherwise there would be more limp sausages than in my dads drying cabinet.

>It would be like a child-free person trying to comfort and infertile person who wants a baby. You know?

Yeah, I absolutely get that. But right now, you're telling the infertile person that you're sure that some miracle will happen. 

> But I can't just sit here and watch fellow humans who are in pain and just ignore them.

You sould like a genuinely good person, but you have to realize that you're not responsible for other peoples well being. Just like you can't fix homelessness, war or famines on your own. And thats okay. Noone, not even you yourself, should demand this from you.

Not mentioning it leads to the obvious conclusion: a loyal landwhale > cucked by stacy.

There you go, you nailed it.
It's about needing someone to validate you, that you're ok and worthy, so you can feel comfortable in your own skin.

But doesn't it pop out at you that that's a mental trap that goes on forever? Like...""I fucked a 6, why can't I fuck a 9, am I not worthy? Am I not good enough?""

Because you can scrape together 50 bucks and go get a blowjob, in other words, sex is on tap anytime you want it. But that's not good enough, it doesn't provide enough validation.

See in reality there's really no such thing as an incel, you can go beta bux and get a wife. But that doesn't provide the validation you want either.

So it's an ego problem, an endless desire to be validated.

See next paragraph.

> They aren‚Äôt balding alien looking framelets. I‚Äôm seriously not even >exaggerating.

Lookism itself is kind of like a mental disease.

I'm not saying you're not ugly, I'm saying I'm ugly too, the difference being I don't give a shit and you're obessessed with it.

Also I have a broader perspective on looks vs attractiveness. Looks is the raw material, an uncut diamond. Attractiveness is the setting, the cut, etc. So at least %60-%70 of that, we have control over it.

I can't do much about having the physique of an ogre. But I can put on a dark suit, slick back my hair and clean up well.

That's Looks vs Attractiveness.

> Not the ‚ÄúNormal situation‚Äù to be 23 HHKV (I know HHKV is a cringey >term, just making it clear my experience is literally zero) who has never >been in a date or successfully gotten a number. 

I think most 23 year olds are KHHV.

But again. $50 blowjob. You can go lose that v-card anytime you want.

> ‚ÄúBig three story house‚Äù nice humble brag

Well I put that there for a reason.

a. It's nice to have things to brag about
b. Life isn't just about getting pussy, it's also about living well in general, living the life
c. If you offer me a choice between fucking a 9.5 and getting $1000, I'll take the $1000, because $1000 buys alot of 9.5's, and 9.5's are mostly just fakeup anyway, beneath the thin venier of hollywood glamour, they're the same fugly alien as you or me, 2 pounds of baloney in a 1 pound dress.

Hollywood is fake, it's bullshit, this whole world is fake. Fake politics, fake beauty, fake money, fake security, fake countries, fake issues, fake religions, fake jobs producing fake value, fake freedom, fake democracy, you're living in the matrix buddy boy.

Men like you built civilization. From dirt. From nothing.

The hollywood 9.5 isn't the real value. You are. But you're too busy crying and moaning into your beer about being a framelet or whatever. You bought into this stupidity hook, line and sinker.

> Hilarious that this is the guy shitting on inkwels and telling them to kill > themselves 

Yep.

So next time you think normies must be having wild monkey sex on the roof, think back to the normie in the big house watching ER.

This is what normies do. This is normie life. Every day isn't a party.

%99 of the time, I'd rather be sitting alone watching old reruns. If some chick rang my doorbell, I would tell her to get off my lawn.

My father was like this too. He was king chad. But he was like ""fuck these bitches, they give me a headache,"" and he would go off into the woods with his best friend, they would catch fish and cook it over a fire. No women, no nothing, ahhhh peaceful life.

What I'm describing of course is a kind of mgtow thing. The mgtow ideal. Women are a nuisance. Self-important pests.

You wanna become a real man someday? Have 2-3 male buddies.

That's all you need in life for ""validation"" or anything else."
3133,"That's true, not all incels are good and not all Chads are bad. That never was what I was trying to argue. I personally had to deal with some disgusting incels and Chads in my life.

What people seem to ignore is that lonely men are a large part of the population and assuming that a big chunk of them is murderers and rapists makes statistically no sense, as the part of the population who has severe enough mental issues is really small and it includes both good and bad looking guys (the famous Elliot Rodgers was a handsome guy and didn't classify as an incel. He was just a maniac who hated women).

You asked for studies and here I deliver: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440510000154

http://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167214543879

Basically psychology points to the fact that aggressive men are considered more attractive and that attractive men get a pass for being aggressive. That includes things like bullying, pushing themselves onto a girl and being manipulative.

It's true, most women grow out of liking them as they get older, but you also have to realize that the good Chads are usually the ones with the highest standards and the first to be taken. So you're left with the bad Chads and the incels. Most women will go after bad Chads for most of their life, until they really need to settle and compromise by finding an ugly and uncharismatic man in a stable enough situation"
3134,Then there's nothing incorrect in what I said

3202,Very nice. Next month I am coming up on six years since my last hug so I'm not gonna lie this is pretty painful to read now. I had a horrific caffeine-induced panic attack in public last semester and nearby was a big group of business school undergrad kids. They came over to help when my legs wouldn't hold me up and I wound up coiled to the fire hydrant like a boa constrictor trying to soothe myself (and maybe open the thing to attempt a self-baptism?) and two of them were girls that both rubbed my back and it was helpful.
3203,Hey I‚Äôm happy for you man any progress is good 
3204,"Happy for you, my man. Sounds awesome "
3205,"Getting compliments on your smell is basically as intimate as a hug too, congrats!"
3206,"It was the fragrance and your approach. Just right. Keep at it, and act suave/reserved, she'll grow fonder. "
3207,"Hey man, small steps! One thing is for sure. If she thought you were gross, she def would never hug you. It's a start, right? :)

&#x200B;

Progress, not perfection."
3208,Save some pussy for the rest of us chad
3209,Congrats man! That‚Äôs awesome
3210,"That's nice, but if youre very unattractive AND socially awkward, she was probably being nice.

It is nice, and comfort is good, but dont go dreaming up romantic fantasies.

In my experience, a lot of people (men or women) get a kick out of being generous, it doesnt mean they like you romantically or in a platonic since, even that they'd stand by you when things get tough.

Just wanted to taper your expectations, take care!"
3211,"I don't want to artificially get your hopes up, because it IS possible that she is just one of those people who is unusually friendly and a rampant hugger, but to me as a woman, those are some pretty strong indicators of interest.  The only other reason I could think of is if you actually sit at her tables frequently and give her huge tips, although even in that case she could very well still be interested in you.

The fact that she essentially said that she missed you and that you smell good are the reasons why I think this, even more than the fact that she hugged you.  I don't know any woman who would act in that specific manner and NOT be somewhat interested.  Those were actions she did spontaneously without you asking for them and without you being sad and her pitying you or anything like that.

It might sound a little weird, but I also congratulate you for paying such close attention to her behavior and picking up on these signals.  My boyfriend had Asperger's, and he literally had his female roommate undressing in front of him trying to get his romantic interest because nothing else she was doing was working.  He was completely blind to these obvious cues, and it happened with a couple of other women too.  

I am quite familiar with the restaurant business in general, and it is pretty frequent for staff members to socialize after work by having a few drinks together at their bar.  One relatively low risk way to spend more time with her and gauge her interest would be to ask her if she'd like to have a drink when her shift is over (or coffee if it's a day shift).  If she agrees to get a drink together, that's a decent clue that she is interested.  If she says something like ""maybe"" or ""I'm really busy right now so..."" or something hesitant like that, then she is likely NOT interested."
3212,That's awesome! Maybe try to hang out with her more? Do you guys have any common interests? 
3213,Yo what soap/bodywash and deodorant do you use man? I wanna smell good too. 
3214,"good for you. last i got hugged was in middle school, ironically i didn't want it at the time but the girl wanted to hug me. gave her a christian side hug."
3215,Awesome broski... not a dumb thing to post about especially no here.... something like that would make my day too
3216,Now you get to unsub!
3217,"Good for you man, next time you do get the chance to hug her include a small compliment, her hair, make-up, maybe a watch or peice of jewelry she has on and guarantee it'll make her smile which will make you smile and may give you a chance for more small talk which could even evolve to a full conversation."
3218,Here‚Äôs to more hugs my man 
3219,"She told you that you smelled good. That's all the IOI you need, you're already in. In her mind she has accepted you as a potential mate but it won't last long. If you don't act soon it will be too late, she will lose interest in you if you don't have the confidence to go after what you want. Decide what you want to do with her then try and make it happen, smoothly.

It doesn't matter if you fuck it up and humiliate yourself, you need the experience of trying so that the next one will be easier. And if a girl is telling you that you smell good then there WILL be another girl that feels the same eventually (as long as you don't let yourself go)."
3220,You‚Äôre the one who talked about ‚Äúescalation‚Äù fyi. That‚Äôs something red pill harassers like to talk about as well
3221,"Aww I love this! This is what incels were supposed to be about. Disabled people who can‚Äôt achieve romantic gestures or relationships because they have a disability.

This was NOT supposed to be for fat, lazy, gamer guys with no personality who are mad because they can‚Äôt get laid.

I really hope that you find the woman of your dreams! You seem so nice!üíïüíï"
3222,"So, how‚Äôs the sex life OP?"
3223,Lol ok hugs literally mean nothing tho
3224,She commented on smell? That‚Äôs a very good sign.
3225,Later virgins
3226,i am very happy for you op
3227,Sounds like she may be into you
3228,Probably feels sorry for you
3229,"Thanks, man. Seeing a bunch of people that don‚Äôt even know me from a hole in the wall being happy for me because of this is just amazing and heartwarming. I appreciate every positive reply and I wish nothing but the best for everyone else here who is struggling like me."
3230,Lol definitely. I‚Äôm trying to not make a huge deal out of this but it just felt so good.

3237,how much caffeine did you ingest to suffer a panic attack? or are you just ultra-sensitive to stims?
3238,Thanks!
3239,"Honestly, I use Axe for both. "
3240,"Worst advice ever. Its not cause a girl give you a hug thay shes into you.

3241,I wouldn‚Äôt recommend him to go straight into asking her out lmao. It‚Äôs a good step in the right direction though!
3242,How are you doing now?
3243,"Made me laugh, thank you."
3244,Indicator of interest
3245,"Hey, I‚Äôm a normie lurker and I just wanna tell you that if girls found you creepy or weird (like a lot of the guys here say about themselves) she wouldn‚Äôt have hugged you or complimented you. Most incels can get past their looks even if they‚Äôre not handsome, and a huge part is being approachable. No small feat if you have autism! I hope one day you‚Äôre confident enough to ask somebody out and that they say yes :)"
3246,They do kind of bully people :(
3247,"Under 100mg probably, it was from green tea"
3248,axe is kind of a meme cologne but it does genuinely smell good
3249,Ah so I'm already half way there. Cheers. 
3250,"No, but remarking on how good he smells is a fair bit more than just a hug."
3251,I never said he should go straight into asking her out
3252,"Looking for indicators seems a bit passive, surely incels should be generating interest?"
3253,Thanks! The kind words are much appreciated. 
3254,"damn, green tea is pretty relaxing it has other compounds besides caffeine with anxiolytic properties. if you get panic attacks off of that then you really are sensitive.

3255,"Smelling good is the base of living in society. Saying it to someone is a compliment, not hitting on him. "
3256,LMAO if we ever figured out how to be interesting  (i.e. good looking and not be weird) most of us wouldn't be incel.
3257,"try to get into the habit of hugging people in general, if its normal for you (like it is for your friend) it will feel normal for other people to get hugs from you"
3258,"Hard for me understand, I've always wanted to ask though, how do incels reconcile totally ugly dudes with girlfriends? Not even all of them are wealthy. Just outgoing more than anything"
3259,"I don‚Äôt really know if getting into the habit of giving people hugs is the best idea. The goal isn‚Äôt to collect hugs, it‚Äôs for people to be comfortable enough around you to build a friendship and possibly a relationship. Hugging people on a regular basis doesn‚Äôt seem like the most normal thing to do, and the only people I know who did that ended up being recognized as quite odd."
3260,sexual harassment accusations incoming...
3261,"I don't know. I've never encountered a non-wealthy, non-famous ugly dude with a girlfriend in real life before."
3262,"Maybe they were naturally odd or felt weird doing it...If so. ...then a hug is going to come across as odd

If it's natural for you...its natural for them....if its awkward for you...its awkward for them 

The goal is not to collect hugs...its to become comfortable and feel natural giving them out...which isn't possible if you are ashamed of hugging people....only way to get over a fear is to face it

I'm not gonna pretend that this would be an easy thing to get the hang of if some one is awkward. Like developing any new skill there is an initial cringe barrier to get over. Like it took me a while to get used to kiss on cheek as a greeting in south America...it wasn't normal by my culture....but when i returned home i would still sometimes cheek kiss greet strangers despite it not being a cultural norm 

And of course....use due diligence as to who to hug and when to hug and when not to...dont have to hug absolutely everyone . i didn't kiss absolutely everyone. Deoends on circumstance and social setting.

And last but not least....there are 2 ways to get to the truth... Experience or Theory. You can theorize what will or will not work or you can theorize based on other people's experience (which may or may not be fully competently executed ), but most reliable is testing stuff based on your own experience....and that requires a bit of trial and error and an initial sucky period....until you develop a natural ability.....and that assumes that experimenting is conducted competently and thoroughly and not just give up after a few failed attempts. "
3263,Have you met many working class married men? Some of em look like alcoholic prunes and yet they have happy marriages and kids
3264,"I‚Äôm not an incel, I‚Äôm just lurking out of curiosity and thought I‚Äôd put in my .02. I hug people on a daily basis, but they‚Äôre my family and my girlfriend, and sometimes close friends if I haven‚Äôt seen them in a while. I just thought that might be a risky move for some, especially because the incels I know irl are not very socially comfortable. 

Perhaps this is a result of the culture in my area. Who knows."
3265,Then they must be running dark triad gene game.
3266,"It's most likely a cultural thing...dont know where you are from but when i visited Canada...even hugs were received awkwardly by a lot of girls....i didn't care, i did it anyway because its part of who i am...its not my issue if someone finds it awkward...its their issue to deal with. 

It's definitely risky....and you never know who is or isn't going to feel awkward....and its definitely more difficult for socially uncomfortable people....i don't anticipate that many people will try this....but its a fact that emotional freedom cannot be found inside your comfort zone. ..infact everything your heart desires is outside of your comfort zone.  And we only achieve the life we want by pushing boundaries and risking embarrassment....and experiencing awkwardness "

i really wish i had his mentality when he was my age, i mean we both grew up in a pretty dysfunctional home, we were both bullied at certain times in schools but he was such a different type of a person that i am, when i get into fights with my parents for being this weird-loner-loser my dad will often say that even tho he is fucked up now he at least had a gf all these years and was a normal person, when im wasting my life doing nothing, and thats true

it is incredibly sad seeing him just nervously stare out of the window or blankly looking into a tv, its terrible seeing a family member like that, the only comfort i get is that he had a taste of good and normal life, and i hope i will experience that life one day too"

You're assuming we don't try. I can speak for myself and say that when I do, it never goes anywhere. Never.

I'm not going to say it's never happened. It has in fact. But I wasn't attracted back, so what good did it do?

I don't want to go into every ""blackpill"" experience I've had, but trust me, there are a number of experiences I've had over the years that have stuck with me and often reinforce the data and feelings that a lot of guys here are talking about."

3340,Also i should note that he isnt completely mentally disabled or retarded. He is a smart kid in certain things. You can talk to him like any normal human but he may react strangely. For example he may just stand up and walk away from you if he is not interested in the conversation. He carries his blanket with him everywhere so he can just sleeep whenever he wants. His parents are fairly well off so he will never work in his life. He will be NEET once he finishes highschool. Some see it as a ‚Äúwaste of genes‚Äù but thats kinda fucked up to say because just because hes true MGTOW doesnt mean hes a waste. I love the fact he doesnt give the thots that try to talk to him the attention he wants. There are other Chads out there for those thots but my cousin height mogs 99.99% of society so that puts him in realm of GigaChad if he was to lift weights but he would never go to a gym lol

Easy. She could betabuxx a Silicon Valley developer who makes 150K per year within a day if she so wishes. 

Meanwhile, some 5‚Äô7 jawless weeb game master  who‚Äôs been told that personality and hobbies matter will think he can have an online relationship with her because they share ‚Äúcommon interests and values!‚Äù

3390,"Yeah but also see why they liked the right picture more. They liked it just because a woman is there whom they find attractive. It shows that most people nowadays truly are extremely shallow. Also, I would highly advise her to not come close to any of the people who liked the right picture, because they will be dumping her like a piece of used toilet paper after they are done with her.

Those people who liked the right picture, certainly they don't give a shit about art and content, they only look for the vessel."
3391,She is attractive imo.
3392,"Come on, she's not Stacy but she's at least 6/10, maybe 7."
3393,You must have really high standards to think she's a 4/10. Does a woman have to be a supermodel to rate 6/10 for you?
3394,No you absolute virgin she is a 6/10

3403,"My hope is that she does it on purpose, but in my years on earth and interacting with women, I bet she‚Äôs not doing a shtick and she actually believes what she says and thinks she‚Äôs right. The absolutely frightening thing is that Board Gaming is mostly likely above average in intelligence compared to most women and YET she cannot understand a single argument if it falls outside of the Just World Fallacy."
3404,"I am no expert in this since I am a male and have no success with anything. But I could imagine to just make up your feet, put some nice color on the nails and take a nice pic, giving poses like spreading the toes apart and such and then you go on one of the NSFW subreddits and start posting things like ""I am selling feet pics, if interested write me a PM"" and don't forget to include the initial feet pic.

Of course it would be good to have a stash of different pics. There are sites like only fans and whatever they are called which might help in providing and selling content.

I am not exactly sure how they work though.

Anyways, this isn't supposed to mean that you should go and do this, just giving my two cents how I think it could work.

There also site like chatroulette and whatever in which people can spent cash on live sessions.

3416,prolly won‚Äôt but law school is expensive so u never kno u may see my feet out there
3417,Does this mean you made and sold feet pics?
3418,No. Just read how people comment here to be wanting to pump and dump.  People aspire to be Chad. And what does Chad do? He pumps and dumps.

3428,"

Well, I have heard about a female law student who went to become a pornstar. Honestly, it made me just sad to read about it. There was someone else as well and her story made me sad as well. She wasn't a law student though. Maybe medical student. No idea, I don't remember. 

I am not into foot fetish though. And I kinda wish I wouldn't have talked so openly about these topics.

3463,"I feel like you guys are making a lot of assumptions about this.  Like that this is a woman doing this, or that this is commonplace, or that this is even real."
3464,"What is the exact definition or assertion of ""blackpill""?"
3465,"Pretty blue pill actually, and unremarkable, applies to everything from employment to dating to hiring a plumber.

""Why did you hire me to fix your sink?""  
""Because you were there and I couldn't find anyone better.""

But if you're smart you take example from other aspects of life, ie your employer hires you because he couldn't find anyone better, but if you prove yourself you can become indispensible, same thing with relationships, she doesn't know your soul from the first moment she sees you, it can take years to really KNOW a person, so you're both kind of bullshitting each other with lovey dovey words that start off rather superficial and fake, but develop into something deeper and real over a long period of time.

That's why ""fake it til you make it"" applies to nearly every situation in life, nobody is born perfectly knowledgable, sometimes you have to shitshow your way thru while reassuring the client that you know what you're doing. Same with romance, same with anything.

The reason why women seem cold-hearted sometimes is that by nature they have an abundance of romantic opportunities, this makes them seem callous, heartless, eschewing the value of individual would-be partners because in their world, would-be partners are a dime-a-dozen. In a man's world, if you find a lover, you might not find another one for months, so each relationship seems alot more vital, more important. To us it seems unthinkable to say to a woman, ""fuck off, I don't love you anymore"" but for women it's pretty standard fare because they have another potential lover around every corner."
3466,"Lots of messed up wounded people out there.  Also lots of super young people who just don't know any better.  I really do think some of the young ones will get better and feel badly about how they treated people.  Others won't.

3528,why are they so mean
3529,"Don't forget the fact that all of IncelTears charitable, socially gracious and stable members are also almost always subscribers, as can be seen in their profiles, to almost every subreddit imaginable in which they can smear, humiliate, attack and take glee in lording over virtually everyone they could get away with doing it to - /r/trashy, /r/IamVerySmart, /r/Badwomensanatomy, /r/Justneckbeardthing, /r/Drama, /r/AmITheAsshole, the list goes on.

Inceltears user, particularly their dainty female ones, for some reason always consistently spend 99% of their time on Reddit exclusively on venting out their sadism on other people and circling like vultures in large groups against any person they've been authorized to pounce on. 99% of their post history revolves around insults and 3rd-grade gossip, no joke. Then they turn around and try gaslighting incels about how 'toxic' it is to complain about stuff or harbor 'hatred' or how women can sense their 'shitty attitudes'. Doesn't work so well when you point out their posting history to them.

Also, as always, an honorable mention to incels being the top priority of getting 'hunted down' and driven to suicide in order to prevent rapes and abuse of women - even as 99.9% of rapes and abuse occur by women's beloved fraternity bros, 'Daddy Doms', and self-admitted terrible partner choices."
3530,Seeing such creativity put into degrading human beings is distressing.
3531,"I think we, as the reasonable bunch have to remember that these people are nearly as psychopathic as the worst incels out there. Importantly, if we respond to this kind of harassment with hate instead of reasonable discussions with admins, it will lead to bans of incel communities, and thus it will be more acceptable to inflame the discussion.

We still need to force discussion on the issue of mental health in the context of expectations set upon everyone, without dismissing others for any reason."
3532,"IT will respond ""give us a link because it could be fake""."
3533,The point of the policy is an easy excuse to ban undesirables
3534,"Why are some of these low key homophobic???  
 lmao"
3535,"Email to admins. Doesn't work?

Email to vice, vox, etc.. it just takes one article.

3536,The issue with this is that everyone from IT thinks all incels are pro rape and they will begin a shooting. And incels think everyone on IT is a pedo that spends hours finding the worst of incels.
3537,"I get the vibe they're really bitter and angry at life, someone with a happy life wouldn't be thinking murderous, violent thoughts. It's lulz all around."
3538,"Damn, if I could I would cure everyone of inceldom. I wouldn't want anyone to commit suicide. If an incel came to me asking for help or advice I would try to help the best I could.


It really breaks my heart how shitty and full of hatred some people are."
3539,"IT moderator here, one of the newer ones, but not so new anymore.

Downvoting everything that faintly resembles ""the enemy"" or his arguments while completely ignoring what he actually says it utterly stupid, by who ever does it. I experienced this behavior mainly in IncelTears.

* I was downvoted by an IT lady on every single answer of mine to her in a some 14 step dialogue. I could finally tell from the vote counter, if she had already read my most recent comment.

I concluded that this must be the way IT mercenaries are programmed.

Edit: Thanks for visiting IWH and making this offer of yours. I appreciate it and would gladly accept your offer for intervention if I hadn't given up reading IT long time ago. My own conclusion, they simply are not relevant, thus **I**gnore **T**hem."
3559,"What you think don‚Äôt matter. The existence of your community harbor a paradigm that contributes to fragile masculinity. You can go ahead and trick yourself into believing you doing the right but you‚Äôre not.

IT literally promotes the exact same negative narrative as braincels did. There is no difference at all. The entire sub fundamentally is build upon hate. Just like braincels."
3560,">Well, I guess reaching out, and trying to create dialogue is not something you guys are interested in, sorry for trying to help fix the rift between the two communities.

I was more than interested in that, a bit over two years ago. Comment after comment getting downvoted to oblivion, then the userbase of your bullying circlejerk told me to ice myself while streaming it for entertainment. Afterwards, I got banned for ‚Äúbeing a jerk‚Äú (the people engaging in the aforementioned behavior are still free to post, however).

No offense, but you shouldn't virtue signal about the rift between the communities and how you want to fix it when your entire subreddit has been on the side of actively shutting down conversation.

>I'll take the downvotes as a hint to fuck off

Or maybe take them as a hint that people here really fucking can't stand the subreddit you run and the people you moderate."

Another wards - I didn‚Äôt break any rules, I was just met with resistance for having an alternative opinion and attempting an open dialogue that I‚Äôve seen the users of that sub claim to support"
3575,"Serious question: 

I think it's fair to say that IT shines more light on Incel subs etc and shows people where to go (before braincels got banned, lots of members said they found their way there purely because of IT). 

So being that IT is causing more people to ""join inceldom"" (as you may put it) and shines a light on those places etc, will IncelTears ever shut down? If you truly cared about keeping potential ""would be incels"" away from there, surely you'd want to remove their #1 advertising source?"
3576,"Except as you pointed out there, I said ""you guys"" and not ""incels"", there is a difference in meaning, you guys refers to the people here, incels would mean every incel, which is not what I was saying. So yes, misquoted."
3577,"It doesn't look like you have any posts on IT unless you are using a different account, so I can't see what comment you were banned for."
3578,"The same could be said about Against Hate Subreddits, it's a big old signpost, but it does make sense, the only problem is that moderating it is exceptionally hard. It is something that I have been thinking it, to remove the locations of where things are from, but I don't think it'll do anything. People will still find there way.

Anyway, this is my last response here, I'm not welcome over here it seems, so I hope I have answered your question, and you are free to contact me in private if you wish. Anyone is, I will engage in any non-hateful discussion, but tend to block abuse, ain't nobody got time for that."
3579,"> My comment was met with downvotes, leading to the assumption that my attempt to reach out is not welcome

So when Incels are automatically downvoted on IncelTears, no matter what they say, that means they are not welcome there?

When I'm called ""trash"" and a ""pedophile supporter"" because I mod incel subs, that means I'm not welcome there.

Just pointing out a lil' bit of hypocrisy..."
3580,"I didn‚Äôt post anything, they were comments, and I wouldn‚Äôt post anything there as they obviously have a differing opinion.

If I could screenshot the message somehow here I would.  Again, didn‚Äôt break any rules, wasn‚Äôt hostile or rude, and this is what happened.  

They claim moral high ground but truth is some of the posters there are just as offensive as the  some of the posters were on Braincels.  The difference is IT‚Äôs bullying and contempt for a large group of people is justified thanks to a few nutcases for which the entire group is stigmatized for"

After all, i got banned for stating my observations. You should also ban the people who virgin shame the guys there.

Since your such a *good fair* poor little *oppressed* moderator who is obviously so much better than incels, I'm sure you will remove this guy's comments and ban him right? https://old.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/df1ye6/thought_this_sub_would_enjoy_this/f317k1f/

That poster was disgraceful for a number of reasons, on that we can agree.

I'll leave a mod note about that Joker poster too, it really shouldn't be getting through, I have denied it once in the mod queue."
3589,">You are attributing behaviours to me that I don't do

Now **you're** reading things into what I didn't say. If you look at my comment, I  spoke about the sub as a whole, not about you specifically.

About you specifically:

+ I think it's good you're trying to point out wholesome things about Incels.
+ You have a cute cat.

To people who have not had issues finding a relationship, or think ""being single is hard"" when they're only without a relationship for a couple of months, don't always understand what it's like for people who have been without relationships for *years*. People who don't have any friends or many friends and have trouble making friends or even talking to people.

It's like those who are in abusive relationships; people on the outside say *""just leave""* but they're not experiencing what that person is experiencing. So it's easy to criticize."

There are things I can relate to, even if some in the incel community tell me I can't because of my gender. I have depression that keeps me isolated, I have few friends and find it hard to even believe they are friends sometimes because my head tells me they hate me, and mock me behind my back. I wouldn't want people telling me to go die, so I don't believe others should have to hear those words, or see in the case of reddit."

I even spent sometime believing that, forwhatever reason, women just didn‚Äôt want me, and that I needed to learn that was ok. 

I see the pain in some incels, and I see the things they say and where their logic takes them, and I remember being at those crossroads before. Thankfully I kept choosing to be positive, and I kept working on myself, because if I went the other direction at those cross roads I could be some lonely, angry redpiller making the cringy posts that get screenshotted on IT.

3767,Technically god gave you them sexual urges but I‚Äôm not about to be religious with you bruh.
3768,Roping thoughts.
3769,"Blue pillers who choose to ignore the transparency of all this will still be lucky enough to have their moments & fit into the social machina; to have kids & keep these patterns continuing. Even then the state of it keeps rising with single moms not feeling shame for their choices & the cel young men who are still told by (mostly female) family members that ‚Äúlooks don‚Äôt matter‚Äù & ‚Äúfind someone with a good heart‚Äù <whatever that means to blue pillers, only for bitter resentment for how life went & will be for them to grab a hold eventually."
3770,"are Chads happier than they were under more solid patriarchy? I think ghetto-Chads may be happier, because it's gotta be satisfying to have tons of children by different women, but they r also in the ghetto which has gotta b stressful. Normies usually say that lacking sex sucks a lot but that having lots of sex starts to get dull, too. I mean Chads always had hot wives and could always cheat a bit if need be, right?"
3771,"Nothing worth living for with my life. No money, no one loves me, no friends, my stupid brain can never be happy."
3772,"Based and selfhatepilled.

Fuck you eye area."
3773,Yeah that's what I said with different words
3774,I still remember that morning when I pulled out my phone at work thinking I was about to cope with my brocels.. the moment I saw that my post history was gone I knew
3775,Not a ‚Äúgood morning‚Äú
3776,That shit broke me so bad. A sunny day ready for my blackpill supplement then boom. Everything I‚Äôve loved about this site gone within seconds
3777,???
3778,Looks like its God's fault then. He has the power to create existence itself but can't stop female hypergamy. Yea. Ok.
3779,It's literally comparable to Nazi eugenics. At least in theory the rate of cels will plummet in coming decades and centuries with the aggressive mating requirements females have nowadays
3780,"If you have cool friends, all that other stuff goes away. Promise. Really easy to find based bros through vidya, even if it‚Äôs just a one-time thing it still helps out your brain a lot."
3781,It was addressed to you woman xD
3782,"Browsed bc one morning before taking the tram to my gym, only to find bc banned when sitting down in the tram, same thing with pirate paradise."
3783,"I know a lot of people blame god, I‚Äôve seen it everywhere. But it‚Äôs ironic that humans are murderers, rapists and a lot of bad stuff and still say that. My point is god doesn‚Äôt interfere with human life, not after the last prophet. If god interfered every time there was a problem then life wouldn‚Äôt be hard, and we wouldn‚Äôt even know about having incels or not."
3784,"They‚Äôll still f-around with SOME low tier men because they‚Äôre often bored & some even choose to do so because they WANT to be single moms. They want to be moms & think it‚Äôs ‚Äúcute‚Äù to have what they may see as a sentient doll, & they don‚Äôt want to share that with the biological dad BUT still want financial support. Dumb people often reproduce the most because they have little to no foresight to their means of living or even the state that their social setting will have due to the large numbers & minimal space/resources."
3785,Can‚Äôt make friends. I also hate video games now. It‚Äôs over mate. Not all of us can make it. That‚Äôs life.
3786,"If God is in fact real, you are completely right in what you just said"
3787,It's sure not my fault despite what the normies say.
3788,imagine being religious JFL
3789,does hypergamy weaken with age? do women who only want Chads in their 20s want mediocre providers in their 40s?
