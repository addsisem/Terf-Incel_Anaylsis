Incel wasn't a popular (compared to now) term for my teen/college years, but my boyfriend says he definitely would have identified with the community if it existed before he met me. I was attracted initially to his sense of humor and obvious intelligence, and we've been together happily for 11 years as of August.

142,Saddam420,"Not a bad effort. Most of this reduces to things that have been posted by normies on incel communities many times before, but I do like that you were so honest here:

>Meeting people is just a matter of odds.

The IT will hate this truth the most, because it destroys their ability to weaponize accusations of ""bad personality."" In fact, if they were able to grasp this and follow it to its conclusion, they would apologize to us and shut down their sub immediately. (If you start getting racist private messages from sock puppet accounts, it's from IT users.)

Also some advice for your advice: Don't make the 'ball rolling' part so dependent on alcohol because many here are on psychiatric medications that interact severely with alcohol, and inviting someone to go drink alcohol and then proceeding to not drink alcohol yourself is potentially problematic in many ways."
143,,">**You don't go fishing to catch fish**,

I can get behind this however,

&#x200B;

> **don't talk to people only because you want something from them**. 

People have agendas, wants and needs. It's just part of human behaviour (selfishness, cynicism). And some people just are not that sociable to get pleasure out of talking to people and being friendly for it's own sake. So you're saying don't talk to people because you have some kind of intention (like to build up your social network, meet more women and that kind of thing) but realistically you can't quash the desire. It's going to be there.

&#x200B;

>**Don't try to impress people**. 

Again, this isn't something that necessarily works in a superficial society. People form first impressions about people all the time based on how you walk and talk, how you present yourself, what kind of job you have. People who are purely superficial are just as rare as people who purely judge others based only on what's inside. Most people are somewhere inbetween those two extremes, so realistically you need to have a blendure of traits that will appeal to both personality types. You talk about ""things that worked for me"" but realistically, you are probably neglecting to talk about ***other*** things that might have worked for you like going to the gym, focussing on your career, focussing on the way you walk, talk and present yourself, improving your looks and style, those kinds of more materialistic qualities.

&#x200B;

>**Meeting people is just a matter of odds** 

Luck plays a role but it is by no means the only important factor. People tend to form cliques and put up social barriers against lone wolves, introverts, shy types and folks with mental health issues or physical defects. That is a barrier that has to be overcome and it is not purely accomplished by going out more which can help but is also a double edged sword (more on this).

&#x200B;

>**""Hey, wanna grab a beer this week?""** 

I understand this has to be contextualised, e.g. in a conversation where you have already built rapport with someone. But if we take this at face value alone, it's not really a suggestion that brings much value. My one is ""would you like to get a coffee some time"" but I use it mostly because I can't think of anything better. I mean there is a world of interesting and fun activities like tennis, salsa, restaurants, theatres and so on. Is getting a drink really the only suggestion you can make to someone? How are you going to make your invitation sound appealing? This person is going to spend time with you so they want to know they will get value rather than just having value leeched off them. How are you going to build up to this kind of invitation? What ways can you be innovative and sound interesting? Just asking people out to drinks is something that more often than not will get a ""sorry but I'm busy this week, maybe some other time though"" type of response. Like I said, I use it but I don't think it should be presented as the optimal strategy at all.

&#x200B;

>*Take yourself on dates*

This is something that is a double edged sword.  Doing this you can build up a foundation for engaging in interesting activities and being an interesting person but you can also be seen as ""that guy"" who's always by himself when you go to these places where hopefully you will also be interested in building up a basis for networking.

&#x200B;

>Being a well-rounded human being is crucial to a good conversation. TV and video games give you very little to talk about. 

Ok, yes I can't disagree with this one. But being good at conversation requires more than just having a wide array of interests. You will need to be good at wit which requires abstract logic. You will need other psychological skills that involve shifting conversations towards subjects you are good at discussing, introducing fascinating anecdotes and in general just being good at improvisation. So having interests is definitely one component of being a good conversationalist but it undermines what actually goes into the art as a whole.

&#x200B;

>It's fine to ask for a glass of water, to say ""dude, that was mean"" or ""please stop interrupting me"". 

Sure but people who do this can also have difficulties socialising. In fact it can come across as an anal, highly  strung-out personality type if you do it all the time. Which is often what happens when guys listen to too much PUA and self-improvement related stuff.

&#x200B;

>*No More Mr Nice Guy*. Every incel should read this book. It really helped me spin things around and realize *I* was being manipulative. 

This is something that makes me sad to hear. Guys can have be non-manipulative and have genuinely good traits but suffer socially and with women regardless. Talking about and complaining of issues you have ***in spite of*** genuinely good traits is something that is often mischaracterised as something that must be non-assertive as well as manipulative which is totally not necessarily the case at all. The *No More Mr Nice Guy* book began a very bad stereotype about ""nice guys"" as manipulative, validation seeking and non-assertive which wasn't fair at all. And it is often recommended as a ""go to resource"" now for men who struggle with women, socialising or other areas in life, where the assumption tends to be that if you struggle in these areas you must be manipulative, validation seeking and non-assertive. Very unhelpful.

&#x200B;

> *How to win friends and influence people*. It's just a great manual on how to deal with other human beings 

I'm sorry but it is not. It is a great manual on how to be a socially subservient ""Yes Man"". In the book Carnegie literally recommends never criticising people or only indirectly so, which does not account for situations where a person may be engaging in destructive behaviour that is potentially dangerous. This is just an example. He also says ""never argue"" or try to prove your right which again doesn't account for many nuanced situations where you may well need to demonstrate correctness if another person is going to engage in potentially foolish behaviour that may harm himself, others or you. There are more instances of passive behaviour and cheesy/forced positivity stuff that really is not particularly helpful at all in that book.

&#x200B;

>*The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F\*\*k*. Optional read. The first chapter (which is free) should be enough. It gets repetitive after that.

I haven't read it. But life requires that people ""give a fuck"".

&#x200B;

My friend's gf once told me she gravitates toward me in social situations bc I make her feel safe (weird thing to say but still cool). I have a really wide set of interests which allow me to go talk Russian history with the nerds in my office, interpersonal drama with the old ladies, share stories with the sales people, and business with the managers.

This is the best list of advice for incels I've ever seen, and I agree with every point on here. Not sure if you've already come across this, but I would focus on trying to emmulate this as much as possible. Basically, stop living in your own head thinking it's impossible to make connections, and focus on being happy with yourself first and foremost. Once you accomplish that, the rest will literally fall into place without much effort. Making lasting connections, platonicaly and romantically, starts with you building love for yourself. Without that, you will continue to fail. "

171,Hugh_Surname,"Trying to keep all this stuff in your head all the time is a surefire way to overthink everything and engage in excessive self-blame. What I found is that I naturally started acting the way this post recommends after getting my first girlfriend. Simply the experience of regularly having sex with someone and spending time with them caused me to be more internally validated, less outcome dependent, more engaged with life, etc.

&#x200B;

So just try to fake all of this stuff the best you can until you can get a gf (who doesn't have to be attractive, or have much in common with you, but should be kind). This is one of those things where sex/a girlfriend really is the solution, at least IME."
172,MaXxUser," **You don't go fishing to catch fish** 

 **Be interesting** 

As a gay dude, who had far to many girls interested in him before he came out of the closet, 3 factors that were huge

I was busy - I had a fucking life, I didn't have time for girls, and that makes you, and your time more valuable. And this isnt a ""fake being busy thing"", this was a I was living my life, doing my best to do things that made me happy.

I wasn't interested - I wanted to do things with people because I wanted to do those things, play Catan, go swimming, go for a road trip, go to an amusement park, and I would always go as a group, and there would always be some girl trying to get my attention

I was happy - One of the most attractive quality's in someone, is that they are happy without you, they dont need you, they are living their best life

&#x200B;

Stop thinking about women, stop trying to chase them, do shit that makes you happy, and I mean genuinely happy, not I played 13 hours of video games happy. Find a ""stretch"" activity aka something outside of your comfort zone and do it. You all know something you want to do, (gym? A party or event? A road trip? A vacation? School? A course? A therapist?) just get started, even if that means its just finding the details out of how to begin."

I'm 'guilty as charged' when it comes to trying to impress other people and I know that's wrong.

It something I'm going to actively try to manage this year. Naturally, as someone at the bottom of the social ladder, this is easier said than done.

Disagree strongly. People on here post about being dishearted because people wrongly assume their intentions. Obviously they could need some advice on this.

>Then the problem is not with intention but communication.

Yes, exactly! That is the point



>You haven't really shown what the positive aspects are.

OP did. I won't take the time to explain to you in detail since OP did that excellently, but i can tell you the key aspects i get from this exact advice.

Self-dating: i feel appreciated and valued, i sometimes meet new people this way and experience new things.

Being selfless when meeting people: people feel comfortable with me and i never get sour when new people/strangers don't return my gestures.

Not giving a fuck: this is about picking battles, though. People instantly get the feeling that i don't judge and i speak my mind so they easily feel safe with me. People used to use me for this, but now i catch on to this and i just tell them how i feel about thst because i don't give a fuck if people will dislike me for who i am. If i lose someone i appreciate, heartbreak is a close friend and i know how to deal with pain. It's better than to give too many fucks.

285,rx470spaceheater,"What you describe is one specific problem you have (to which I can certainly relate), while someone else might have problems with a different point in the post, but the thing is, if he went into great detail for every single point, it would be 20x longer and nobody would bother reading all of it. People fill entire books trying to answer the question you're asking (how to have a good conversation). I don't know the answer myself, so I can't give any good advice, sorry. I guess it could help a bit to listen to other people have those kinds of conversations, e.g. at work (although they rarely get very personal...), and to try and notice how the conversation is propagated at each turn."

I would however never share any precious free time or food with them unless they showed some of the general niceness and interest.

This can happen for various reasons. In particular if you are a woman, people are 10 times more likely to speak to you and want to keep you company. The effect absolutely will not be the same for everyone.

331,quercusp,"Oh this is great, I seem to have the honor of being in conversation with a mod. So let me please take the opportunity to demonstrate to you a more elaborate view on IT.

>We also try our best to censor personal information including usernames and are against doxxing.

I think this goal is achieved. The dark side of this moon, is that in many cases I doubt, that the quoted examples are real at all, because there is no source given with them. Sometimes I assume that the quoted shit is indeed invented by IT users themselves. And to be strict, even if these examples are copied from braincels, it is still possible that they have been placed there by an IT user in order to further ridicule incels. But ruling out such skulduggery is out of scope of the mods.

Therefore let's consider the more obvious misbehavior as mentioned before, this time partly with source:

1. A bulk of 1100 IT users advocate blaming incels for desecration of dead bodies [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/98z2m8/what\_kind\_of\_expetiment\_is\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/98z2m8/what_kind_of_expetiment_is_it/)
2. A braincel post was quoted and actively ""enriched"" with the idea of  rape, just in order to once again accuse and ridicule incels. [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/99dx3c/incel\_cant\_understand\_why\_rape\_is\_bad\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/99dx3c/incel_cant_understand_why_rape_is_bad_and/)
3. Urging to suicide and bullying glorifying IT posts, collected by another user: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/95t5qq/it\_doesnt\_want\_to\_help\_incels\_they\_want\_us/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/95t5qq/it_doesnt_want_to_help_incels_they_want_us/)
4. Several times I tried to reasonably and modestly discuss with IT users. Never possible.
5. As sure as there is the amen in the church, any user in IT who tries to defend one aspect of incels, is downvoted. This happened not to just me.
6. Once there was the claim, that incels generally do not pay their taxes. I objected, that this judgement is not fair, and that I always paid my taxes. Immediate 40 downvotes.
7. A man left IncelTears because ""I can‚Äôt take it anymore"". The posts in this subreddit made him fear for the fate of his daughter. ""The mentality of an incel is sickening and frightening and to know that she could be one bad conversation away from being raped or murdered by one of them gives me panic attacks."" This is the result of this perpetual toxic rain falling from the IncelTears cloud. [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/995b3u/why\_i\_am\_leaving\_inceltears/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/995b3u/why_i_am_leaving_inceltears/)
8. One gets the impression that not only that all incels are rapist, but even worse, that all rapists are incels.
9. While there is hatred in Braincels against women, it is based of real personal bitter experience of their members. On the other hand the hatred in IncelTears against incels is mostly taken out of fresh air, based only on some idiotic utterances on the Internet. Most of these hateful IT user do not even know one incel in person.
10. The hatred of Braincel users is diffusely spread over half of humanity, while the hatred of IncelTears users is focused on a minority, the incel, which are suffering anyway from life. That makes quite a difference in severeness and pain it induces."
332,Board_Gaming,"If you find content that is against Reddit's content policy, then report it.

That sub is out to bully and harass people."
334,,"Main points is that human attraction is based mostly if not entirely on your appearance/sex appeal. If you lack that you cannot get a partner no matter what you do. IE if you're ugly you'll die alone with no hope to experiencing intimacy/sex without either paying for it (which wouldn't solve the incel issue since there is no love and the person you pay obviously does not like you or want to do it willingly, just for money) or having to get extreme reconstructive surgery to drastically altar your appearance to potentially attracting someone. 

Many examples of women taking interest in criminals because they are physically attractive whilst ugly men are shown to be either ignored or simply used as a means of monetary gain.   
When all this info comes to people who all their lives were led to believe women were all collectively these kind/gentle beings and that all you gotta do to get one's affection is to simply be a stand-up/well hearted person  only to learn that was all a lie, it can be VERY detrimental to a person's mind, emotions and overall outlook.  
It's a mixture of disbelief, confusion, anger/frustration that makes you question everything you thought was true, ON TOP OF knowing you aren't and will never be good enough. That dating is nothing more than a superficial rat race with little to no fulfillment and that society continues to place your worth as a man on whether you've had sex or not.

3. Some people believe that all bad things are caused by the incels. That is not true, but some people still believe that. They shouldn‚Äôt and is a poor judgement on their part.
4. If the subreddit scared him, he should honestly leave and will make no attempt to bring him back. But the world is, unfortunately, a very scary place where a lot of bad things happen.

Mainly the whole focus on ‚Äúwomen seek power and good looks and nothing else‚Äù bit. Remember, women are people too. The whole ‚Äúhypergamy‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt seem so strange if you reverse the role; if the princess of some country was in love with you, you would want to marry up if you could. And a lot of the time the whole ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù thing isn‚Äôt as clear-cut as it seems. Some of these people are actually good to them, even if they are standoffish jerks to everyone else. And sometimes it‚Äôs just honestly poor decision-making that comes with regrets. Lastly, appearance is NOT static no matter what you look like. Anyone can always shave, comb, exercise, wear nicer clothes, and change some little things. But it seems like for some of these people, they would rather blame something out of their control than put in hard work to keep themselves in a good position. It is a grim reality, but only if you think it is reality. Make sure to talk to a therapist if you need to."
344,browsingpornignoreme,In my book you're doing a pretty good job already!
345,Stormypwns,"You're right there. I'm not exactly in the same boat as most incels, as I do have some friends with whom I socialize regularly (I do have a job after all) but know that a lot of incels don't, and a good amount of them are agoraphobes, or would find a space like that threatening. My point isn't so much pertaining to myself so much as trying to help you understand the position that some of us are in. 

The fact is that despite your own good will, the majority (and I must stress that we're not just talking about the vocal few) on IT condone shaming and bullying incels. Sure, they're fucked in the head. You're right, but what IT does and perpetuates isn't helping anyone and is entirely detrimental. 

The purpose of the sub to begin with is to spread hate by shaming mentally ill people who obviously need some kind of help, if only an end to their misery. To IT's credit, there is quite a bit of encouraging us to commit suicide, which is fair enough. 

My point is that you take issue with the misogyny, hate, and perpetuation of violence that incels spread, while actively defending a group that majorly and by design perpetuates violence against incels under the pretense that ""Oh we're not all like that."" when infact that is what the sub was intended to be.

If you want to say we deserve more suffering, to kill ourselves, to be round up and shot, then fair enough. That's your opinion and you're welcome to it, I'm not even too inclined to say that it's the wrong one. At that point, however, you have to relinquish your moral high ground and realize that while operating on what is certain to be a drastically higher plane of intelligence quotient than us incels, IT still has the animalistic human desire to hurt and put others below themselves, wherever their conscience will allow."

348,quercusp,">1. Some people fake crap for karma. It happens.

Maybe, but this excuse is clearly not applicable here: 1100 upvotes for a hateful claim, means 1100 hateful people on IncelTears. Period.

>2. Some people don‚Äôt understand nuance and just bandwagon. That also happens.

This excuse only applies to IncelTears?

>3. Some people believe that all bad things are caused by the incels. That  is not true, but some people still believe that. They shouldn‚Äôt and is a  poor judgement on their part.

Some people believe that all bad things are caused by the *women*. That  is not true, but some people still believe that. They shouldn‚Äôt and is a  poor judgement on their part.

>4. If the subreddit scared him, he should honestly leave and will make no  attempt to bring him back. But the world is, unfortunately, a very scary  place where a lot of bad things happen.

If a subreddit scared *her*, *she* should honestly leave and will make no  attempt to bring *her* back. But the world is, unfortunately, a very scary  place where a lot of bad things happen.

See what I mean, why not applying this same reasoning to for example Braincels and leave these people there in peace?

>5. Hating more people doesn‚Äôt make it any better. Hatred of any group is a problem.

So why tolerate the hatred in IncelTears and not that in other subreddits?

>6. If somebody seriously says some of the things said on braincels, it  makes sense that people would be concerned. I don‚Äôt know David Duke in  real life but I know from his uttering on the internet that he is a bad  person.

Idk what you are referring to. What kind of things said on braincels? What's the context to a ""David Duke""?"

350,,"""The whole ‚Äúhypergamy‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt seem so strange if you reverse the role; if the princess of some country was in love with you, you would want to marry up if you could.""

No I wouldn't and most incels wouldn't either. It goes against their own beliefs of things like social status being an irrelevant trait. Even if I did, this argument is terrible since it's just some way to make it seem like it's ok for them be lonely and miserable because ""well u kno ppl wanna all d8 kings/queens bro"".

""But it seems like for some of these people, they would rather blame something out of their control than put in hard work to keep themselves in a good position. It is a grim reality, but only if you think it is reality. Make sure to talk to a therapist if you need to.""

Any person with an IQ above a single digit would rather not. Why would you put a bunch of effort for nothing? That thing out of your control determines the quality of your life as well? Also what ""good"" position? There were never in one lol."
351,gmmp1,"And what next? Every new social opportunity I get myself into I expect to be different but it's literally the same story since puberty.

My friends don't put themelves ""out there"" as much a I do because they aren't bottom whatever percent of male attractiveness. They've met their gfs through class or through mutual friends or a random hookup at a wedding. Nothing I do will ever yield those results - I've been doing those things for years and they've never gotten me anywhere close. What am I supposed to do? Same thing for the next 7 years until I'm 30 and some woman is sad enough to deal with me?  If no woman likes me now at 23 when every woman is looking for some guy, any woman who might like me later on must be out of desperation."
352,BlackMoonstorm,"As I‚Äôve stated before, suicide is not the answer. Originally, from what I can tell, the point of the sub was to make sure the ideology didn‚Äôt run rampant and uncontested in the market of ideas. Even though many people just bandwagon onto any group that‚Äôs against another group just to hate, from what I can tell that wasn‚Äôt the point of this subreddit.

And yes, I‚Äôm all in favor of people getting mental help. I‚Äôm sure most of us wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with the people themselves outside of their ideas. Why do you think incels complain so much that everyone says that they have a ‚Äúbad personality‚Äù? These people ostracized themselves, and the best answer is to get mental help. 

Nobody deserves to suffer, and being hateful because of self-loathing doesn‚Äôt fix anything. I haven‚Äôt heard anyone say they actively or passively wanted to commit an act of violence against anyone with the ideology because of the ideology. We aren‚Äôt against people getting mental help. We don‚Äôt hate the people. We are opposed to the ideas that stem from the damaged worldview that a large collective of people who need mental help have thought up. The original use of ‚ÄúIncel‚Äù was on a board to help the community before it spiraled out of control. If and when we hear that somebody is dropping the incel mindset through therapy, we don‚Äôt scream at them to get back to their hole. We support them and try to help them to rehumanize the people around them. 

TL;DR: Hateful people exist everywhere. People misuse power too. However, a group can still be good even if a majority of its members are not. "

355,BlackMoonstorm,"From what I can tell, 1100 is much less than the total number of subscribers to the subreddit. And this was about people faking posts.

The difference in the lack of nuance between IT and braincels is rather large. 

You made my point for me on number 3.

But IT say things that are actually true, not just peoples‚Äô world views.

I dislike the hatred on both sides. But disagreeing with an ideology does not mean hating everyone with that ideology.

A popular incel claim of self-defense is ‚Äúhow do they know we have bad personalities and aren‚Äôt just horribly ugly?‚Äù People on braincels have advocated for rape, incest, and pedophilia. David Duke is the current leader of the KKK. I‚Äôm not saying that incels are racist, but saying things equivalently hateful doesn‚Äôt look too good.

EDIT: Btw hatred does not justify more hatred. Saying that IT is hateful doesn‚Äôt mean that braincels gets the ‚Äúmean pass‚Äù too."

And this may come as a shock, but most of these ‚Äúhideous monsters‚Äù look perfectly fine, though they may not stand out. Your looks have far less of an impact on most things in life than other factors. E.G.

389,chalkandapples,"\> Isn‚Äôt it obvious enough that if you‚Äôre at least 18 years old and still a virgin that it‚Äôs because most women find you repulsive and that you‚Äôre a confirmed incel?

My brother and most his friends didn't even start dating until 20-21. Later parts of college when they're stable with their career (got good internships or an offer out of college). He did nothing except play video games with his friends throughout high school and was too busy trying to secure employment out of school early parts of college, and then suddenly got interested in girls after all that. I would say looks wise he's above average but still within normie range. He's VERY sweet and gentlemanly though. Like we used to role play pokemon and he would always let me be the stronger / type advantage pokemon so I can win and be happy, and he's my LITTLE brother so if anything I would be letting him win. 

I had problems dating because I'm very asocial and avoidant, but normal people like my brother and friends find relationships very naturally. Similarly it's much easier for him to walk into a social event or party and come out of it with new friends, while it's very hard for me to just make friends from one interaction."

393,ufixusif,Your IQ must be too low then.
394,chalkandapples,"I honestly think it has to do with the fact that we have a ton of more entertainment. We're not bored enough to desperately want to pair up and make kids. Relationships and kids are hard, there are a ton of entertainment that's easier to get and less stressful. It's much easier and simpler to spend a night playing my favorite video game than a first date. At the same time, stuff that's harder to get is more fulfilling and eventually might lead to more. But often we don't realize that, or the pain doesn't get as bad until we're older and got tired of cheap entertainment. 

I say this because I get into a lot of discussions with my parents/grandparents since I was single for so long, and they said when they were my age they really had nothing else to do other than start a family. Even job wise things were simple, they got a job and just kept working at it and they're promoted mostly based on seniority."

426,unknownhorrorwriter,"I have. I do it all the time and constantly post on various subs.

Regardless of how people wanna spin it, men have low self-esteem and body issues too. And I say this as a nice-looking guy with a big dick. I struggle with low self-esteem everyday. I don‚Äôt talk to women well, was bullied growing up, called ugly and creepy by women the majority of the time I tried to ask them out. I mean I‚Äôm not sure what the fuck people expect? The reality is as a woman, no matter how unattractive or ugly you are, you can make a Bumble or Tinder and collect hundreds of matches from hotter guys in minutes. Instant ego boost.

As a man on the same level, or even an unconventionally-handsome one like me, we don‚Äôt have that luxury. Instead, we stare at empty inboxes while women naturally gravitate to the smoking hot dudes. So yeah, I show off my big dick. Oftentimes, the woman will at least talk to me afterward and compliment me. Either way, it‚Äôs a fuck ton better than not getting any matches or endless read-not-replied messages. At the end of the day, most people use these shithole apps to feel hot. So women can post ass and boob shots for their profiles and I‚Äôm evil for showing off my long bulge? Fuck that.

Newsflash: it‚Äôs not a man problem but a desperation problem. I‚Äôve been sent unsolicited nudes and cyber-stalked by various women, and the common denominator was they were ugly as shit. Not just ugly, I mean UG-LEE. Like so ugly, they don‚Äôt even get attention on Tinder. They were dying for dick. The reality is desperate people do desperate things for attention. Women are no different than men. Studies have shown they are just as horny as men. They wanna feel hot too. There are just more desperate men as a result of guys being forced to go on the prowl while women can sit back and collect compliments/matches like Goddamn royalty. All women can do this too as long as they aren‚Äôt super ugly. Unlike men, where only the conventionally hot guys have this luxury. Plus, gender roles play a part as well (guys who have sex with a bunch of women are studs, women who have sex with a bunch of dudes are stigmatized as ‚Äúsluts‚Äù). Not to mention the VAST FUCKING MAJORITY of the time, men are the aggressor. They are expected to make the first move. Something women won‚Äôt comprehend as they essentially play the fucking waiting game. They will never experience the awkwardness of asking a woman out and not being sure if she‚Äôs attracted to you or not. Nor will she usually experience the soul-crushing fun of being rejected.

If gender roles were reversed, and women were forced to go on the prowl while even ugly men could sit back and collect matches all night, you‚Äôd have tons of non-hot women cyber-stalk and send unsolicited nudes for the dude‚Äôs attention. Especially since the guys would be focused on the superhot women. 

You‚Äôre telling me the okay/cute young woman with big boobs isn‚Äôt going to send unsolicited nudes to the hot guys ignoring her for the Instagram models? üòÇ No one is on those fucking apps to stare at an empty inbox.

This is just reality. People want attention and to feel hot. Deal with it."

In all honesty, I have found it quite easy to not send one of these unsolicited pictures.   Perhaps it is a generational thing.   At 43 years of age, I just don't remember ever thinking at any point in my life that this was a good idea.   It's always sounded more like a joking meme, and less like something people actually do.

557,SkyOminous,"**Well, kids spend most of their day in school, and that was a nightmare for me:**

Started out year one as some kind of prodigy. I was known as the smart one.

Constant physical and psychological bullying from both teachers and students at school.

Constant bullying from both educators and other kids at the after-school place I went to because my parents worked till late.

Can't relate to other kids. Pretty much friendless.

The only ""panic attack"" I've had in my entire life was caused by a teacher verbally attacking me for something I didn't even do. After that day I remember feeling dumber and slower each morning (dunno exactly what happened).

I talked back to my teachers when they were being idiots. Sometimes got written up for bad behaviour.

""Obviously"" kids are always wrong and adults are always right...

Constantly grounded at home.

My parents don't believe that my teachers are the problem. Instead, I'm the one to blame.

Had no motivation to study.

My grades kept plummeting.

I fail and have to repeat a school year.

Even more grounded. Can't even cope with video games any more.

9th grade arrives.

Finally have good teachers, my grades go from failing at almost everything to having max grades in most subjects.

Enter 10th grade in a new school. I realize that I'm so socially impaired that I can't even make friends.

I was once again known as the smart kid. Until that point I had actually forgotten that I was considered ""smart"" in the past.

Got called an autist. Even though I was offended, it made me research a bit about autism and I find out it would explain my hardships when growing up.

To this day my parents dismiss my suspicions. *""You don't look like an autist""*. Who even knows at this point...

Got my first crush. A girl from another class.

Took almost a full year to gain courage to talk to her.

Obviously, she already has a boyfriend. At least I managed to get a temporary friend.

12th grade arrives. I was once again bullied by a teacher.

Gym teacher, lies to other teachers about me and purposefully fails my grade. Once again, the adult is always in the right.

The sweetheart of my English teacher was the only one who believed me. She's probably the most empathetic human I've ever met.

School's over anyway. I'm now ~~19~~ 18. Begin university.

As a repeat of 10th grade, I'm unable to make any significant friends. I'm no longer the smart and talented kid (though I disagree I ever was), and I'm actually one of the worst in class. No friends, no girlfriend. Every girl has a boyfriend anyway, it never even began.

And here I am today. I wouldn't go back for anything."
558,soilednapkin,You know
559,randall-politics,"Nope, I just believe in miracles."
560,randall-politics,"Galatians 5:22-23

""But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.""

You say you are seeing a lot of sin in your life.  Well it is good, you are recognizing sin as sin, that is the first step.  Do you believe God can change your heart and change lives?  And are you willing to let him?  We all have things to work through, but if we are willing to change and willing to have faith it may be granted by God's grace.

Many have been through it, it has been recorded over the last 2,000 years. All manner of vices has been cleansed from people's lives, including my own.  You are no less worthy than the rest of us."
561,TheSoftParade69,"I had them from 2005 to 2009, I remember those models fondly. Each year their would be a new gimmick, like a new gun or spinner thingy. I didin't have a ton of money but whenever I did me and my brother would go out and buy our own canister. Then we'd play with them in our room, making up storylines and arcs."
562,Budget_Shift,For me I never really got better. I sort of drifted from one drug to the next trying to feel happy and content but never being able to. Like I remember wanting to die when I was like 8-9 years old but my attention span was so short I never stayed on it for too long. Its been a constant problem throughout my life.

Thats probably why they were bamboozled by your question.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right, I think everyone can have preferences, but I actually... I mean, it's semantics, but I don't think having reasonable preferences is ""shallow"". 

A girl saying she wants a guy who can actually take care of himself and make a half-decent living.. I think that's reasonable. Demanding a guy who makes over $100,000 a year and saying they'd never settle for less (when that's like... What, 10% of the male population)? That's shallow.

A guy saying he wants a girl in half-decent shape who isn't morbidly obese is fine IMO. Saying that a girl who has the slightest amount of extra fat on their belly is ""a fat whale who I'd never even look at"", would of course, be extremely shallow.

I'm throwing out crazy and more limiting examples when it comes to percentages of population. But look at average height in the United States. Saying you demand a guy be over 6 feet tall, when that excludes 2/3 of the male population, based on a SINGLE TRAIT... That's shallow. Look, I get it, some guys get the short end of the stick. Being 5'3"" as a guy is sure as hell to be a tough life. But DEMANDING the top 33% over a single trait (and not a collection maybe of ideal traits) means you're probably putting WAAAAY too much weight on that single trait, which again, I think is shallow. 

Going back to the income vs weight thing.. Actually, just look at how the two are treated. ""Young successful women are having a tough time finding dateable men! They're all poor!!"" You know, instead of saying ""Wow, this is a societal problem and men are suddenly not doing very well, and how can we fix that"", the responde is ""Men are doing badly... It sucks that women need to put up with that."" And then on the fat acceptance thing, ""No, you go girl! Society should conform to you!""

So I think these examples really come full circle. And the fact is... I agree with you on why the Tess Holiday situation is the way it is. It's about nothing but trying to appeal to a specific demographic that's extremely loud, and a movement that's very ""trendy"" right now. But I think my biggest point is that if it were talking about men, it wouldn't be ALLOWED to be trendy. ""Suck it up"" kind of thing. ""You're fat, and that's just against women's preferences sweetheart. Maybe if you would not be fat, you'd do fine!""

The attitudes on the same issues are so radically different that it's actually kind of insulting to basic intelligence. But then we can go into deeper philosophical discussions on how women are ""more valuable"" than men since they have a relatively long gestation period, and a finite number of eggs to reproduce, which could be why society (and men) naturally coddle women more. And I'm not even saying ""OMG, THAT'S WRONG, WOMEN ARE TERRIBLE!!"" Mostly, I'm just pointing out the double standards, and not saying any of this out of any real hatred. More like ""hatred of the game, but not the players""."
840,BlackHeart357,"Yes. Including me, and just about everyone else. The difference is that I'll admit it. Look, I'm on the chunky side, and I'm a 4 overall. But I'll 1000% admit I'm not eager to date a girl who's morbidly obese. I'm being real. And no, I don't expect a supermodel, either. I doubt I could relate to most anyway, so even on that level, it generally wouldn't work. Anyway..

Somehow, preferences for men have become prohibited. If you're a man, ""improve yourself"". If you're a woman, ""men should love you just the way you are!"" I'm exaggerating a bit, but you know what I mean.

Tell you what: Find me the male equivalent of Tess Holiday being on the covers of world-famous magazines whose covers are often centered around physical attractiveness. I'm SURE there's an exception somewhere, but like I said, you probably get what I mean to an extent.."

That's the reason you see women from 4'11 to 5'11 with the same requirement for a man to be at least 6 feet tall. It's not that the short women are ""more shallow"" or ""overcompensating"" and the taller women are ""more fair"", their own height just isn't important - what's important is that the male is **taller than other males** - because men are status objects to women and if a status object isn't fancier than the status objects of others, it's worthless.

Saying ""taller is more attractive"" is different than saying ""height is a REQUIREMENT"".  I've had this discussion with incels who explicitly exclude black women on the basis of their race. In my mind if I was in a situation where I became less attractive than before, the first thing I would compromise would be unalterable physical traits that have no bearing on character.

I have noticed that at least men will acknowledge this, whereas women seem to be deathly allergic to being labeled as shallow. I respect people who at least own their true beliefs even if I dislike them for it."
873,Squez360,">like someone not thinking you're attractive isn't shallow to me. you can't force someone to think you're attractive 

Do you know about the fat acceptance movement? It was not to make you find bigger women attractive. This is a social movement seeking to change anti-fat bias in social attitudes by raising awareness about obstacles faced by fat persons for the general public. Right now, men are being judged for their height (and other bone structures), but unlike weight, height is genetic and not hazardous to our health like obesity. There is ***nothing*** a man can do if he is being discriminated against by women for his height. Some women have said men who are shorter than 6ft are a [waste](https://twitter.com/sonessasary/status/561251830634524672), [useless](https://twitter.com/NonnyUzo/status/447928329157357568), and should [kill themselves](https://twitter.com/shawna_philly/status/490617982834728961). The point to show women's shallowness isn't to force a chick to like you for being short. It's to raise awareness of society's ugly attitude towards men's looks."

Status objects. And not necessarily solely, however it becomes more apparent in respect to romantic association and attraction, for those women who place a great value on male height - whether that's every woman in the world or only a part of them is up for interpretation. Outside of sexuality women can certainly see short men as platonic friends for example. 

>why do you think your life is the way It is?

Absurd question. Like everything in existence, ""my life is the way it is"" as a result of cause and effect."
896,weebmuttgymcel,"Facial attractiveness is not subjective. All attractive faces share certain features - defined jawline, forward growth, prominent zygos. 

You may think that there are lots of different kinds of attractive people, but that‚Äôs likely because you don‚Äôt even notice the unattractive males in your life. There are maybe ten ways to be attractive and there are a million ways to be ugly. 

It is the absolute definition of shallow to judge people based on their face. I see that this idea bothers you, because you are guilty of it. You are dismissing all of a persons accomplishments and their personality for a genetic marker that was determined at birth. How is that not shallow? Women literally don‚Äôt care what you‚Äôve done or how you behave. If you have an ugly face, you will never be dating material. If you have an attractive face, you will always be dating material. It doesn‚Äôt get any more superficial than that."

Relationships are often started for pragmatic, unromantic and unsexual reasons, more often in the past than in the modern age, and more often when women are past a certain era in their lives and opt for stability rather than excitement. The term ""beta bux"" is well understood in incel spheres. 

If you want to see evidence of height having decisive value for women, simply look at the tallest people on the earth, the [Dutch](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2015.0211). Or go to any dating site and look at the requirements women tend to list.

I would often go out there to try to think about where I went wrong with my life, contemplate suicide, or just to spend some time isolated from the rest of the world. Sometimes I would go out there and sing about how much I hated my life. I would stay on that swing until the wee hours of the night almost every day. It was fun, but at the same time, a way to cope with my painful life.

You know how easy it to be friendzoned by a girl? There is a cute girl where I work with who will hug and talk to ANYONE. She just won't fuck anyone who comes her way.

Now if that's what you TRULY want then the old just lift and shower bro thing will work. I however, suspect this is not the case. Interacting with women =/= attracting women. That's just the truth. If no one will even acknowledge you or listen to your problems, then it is something you are doing wrong.

This is coming from a socially awkward 24 year old college drop out KHV, so don't even start by Chading me. Yes, I lift. Yes women have made passes at me, but believe me that's not enough to get a relationship. The only time I've ever seen women literally throw themselves at men is if they are basically gigachad, which let's face it, he doesn't even care for the emotional support at that point. He just see women as another hole to stick his 10 inch penis in.

Edit: Minus the kissing and putting your face in her breasts thing. That's something only women who are into you will do, but that is kind of vaguely sexual anyway.

All Reddit links are NP links, in which you can find: Women talking about touching guys, including 'constantly', as a 'completely mild' flirting technique, including with guys they barely know and guys whose mind they clearly didn't 'read perfectly' because they ended up rebuffing them. Men talking about the physical shit that women are always pulling off with dudes they find attractive, including the posters, even though they find it 'creepy' - yet the women can always keep doing it scots-free. Women describing guys touching their lower waist or backs briefly as an acceptable 'signal' ( I.E, no explicitly consent or previous sexual relationship necessary ), and an article about flirting from researchers which states the following:

>""But what works better than anything else? Touching. And research has isolated which types of touching are regarded as ""merely friendly,"" in the zone of ""plausible deniability,"" or ""going nuclear"" - Friendly: Shoulder push, shoulder tap, handshake Plausible Deniability: Touch around the shoulder or waist, touch on the forearm.

>""What about for men? Touching **is almost always acceptable for women, but can get men in hot water real fast.**

No way researcher-kun! Really? Maybe your next study should be about who's responsible for pushing blatant double standards ( Hint: It's not the homosexual demographic ) , but then you won't be able to publish it, will you? So to summarize, don't forget to keep all of this in mind whenever some woman attempts to justifies *any* kind of criticism or punishment simply because someone dared to touch her arm. It's the same deal with 'creepiness', 'objectification' and bluntness, which is what I started my collection about - Wanna know which 'creepy' acts exist that women *haven't* seen fit to pull on Chads and then brag all over SexPositive, TrollX, AskWomen, GoneWildStories, and StupidSlutsClub about? Literally none. 80% of women are doing whatever they deem 'inappropriate' or 'dehumanizing' or 'too desperate' to hot guys they don't know, have no rapport with, and never established consent with a thousand times over, and evidence is plentiful."

Nursery is Kindergarten and is a preschool environment.

Kids start primary school at around 4 years old, and this goes from Reception to Year 6, though sometimes schools are split between infants (R - Y3) and junior school (Y4 - Y6)

Years 7 to 11 are secondary school and go up to when someone is 16 years old. 

A Levels (AS and A2) are generally done in sixth form and go between 16 and 18 years old. When I was studying, this stage was not mandatory. Sixth form is often referred to as college in the UK while university is either called that or 'uni' for short.

A decade ago, the minimum age to legally leave school was raised to 17, meaning AS Levels are effectively mandatory."

In Latin America and East Asia. You need to travel abroad.

> When they talk about white men they talk about tall good looking Chads.

Remember that the average height is shorter over here, so a man who's average in Europe and North America could be considered tall by Latin American and East Asian standards.

> But I'm sure they will even bang Arabs as long as they are hot and tall.

That's true. The heightpill beats the racepill. You're right in that being white is not enough. The advantage that white men have in the international dating market derives mainly from the fact that white men tend to be taller on average than other ethnic groups."
1157,,No we don't believe in that. Did you wonder why it made the news? Because it's wrong and shocking! Now explain to me how this equals those damned invaders screwing your precious children or that it's somehow in our religion to screw children. We actually do have laws on marriage and l am a Sunni Muslim not Shia.
1158,,You are going to ignore the part where it's banned meaning illegal huh? Well you spin it however you want. I heard you Jews fuck kids too. Look there's Epstein and everyone knows that doctrine means nothing. He was a Jew and fucked kids therefore you are a pedophile too.

It all depends on what they can get where they are. Travelling abroad isn't my cup of tea and never will be. We get the same thing here in Australia .

1161,,"Not so much the point about child marriage. My point is with the Brits-
who are throwing the book at this guy for touching an adult woman, let things like that slide because they don't want to look racist to that sect who does that. There were cases in the news of grown men taking advantage of very young girls in England, and the law turned a blind eye. They weren't Jewish or Christian either. 

It may be wrong and shocking to the western world but they seem to be fine with it. I'm sure it is not everyone, but they seem pretty proud of what they do."
1162,,"The man making this statement seems (maybe not) to be a religious representative of the community. It seems the government is the one prohibiting this terrible thing, but the core religion (or some crazy sickos) seems to be ok with it. 

As for Jews, yes, there is scripture condoning ""marriage"" with girls at very young ages (even younger than stated). I don't believe they consummate though until they are older, but the idea being the woman has no say in the marriage.
Obviously today no one does that.

Epstein is far from an example of the Jewish community, where merely touching a woman that isn't your wife comes with very major ramifications, if you believe."
1163,KahnSuperphone,"Non-white girls from 1st world countries such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong also have a strong preference for white men."

Of course you were there and heard all of the evidence from this ""grown woman"". You were also there for the cases of these very young girls? You saw the court permissible evidence and determined that the court did not want to look racist? You now know these child molesting pedophiles to know they seem proud? How exactly did they show you they were proud? I will assume for the sake of argument that you can link me these stories of these men looking smugly at the camera holding up signs of guilt and looking proud.  Otherwise you're another racist. Isn't that cute that it shouldn't be assault for a white kid, but damn those invaders you never met either. Totally not racist. Believe all women, but only if he isn't white! How does that work in your head?"
1165,,Our governments are based on Sharia law aka the Qur'an. Rape is not okay. It's punished by death. In Islam you can not force a woman to marry you or purchase a wife from her father or anyone else. That is rape and always had been. It was never allowed in Islam. You're spouting racist bullshit again.
1166,Budget_Shift,"They have a preference for white CHADS. Not white men. If I went to any of those countries I guarantee I wouldn't get a single girl. But, then again, why would i? A part of the reason we are in this mess is because people wont stay in their lane."

1168,,"There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that the UK does not pursue persecuting ""refugees"" in their country, especially if anything is religious based. Many EU countries make exceptions for child marriage. 

17 is actually totally legal in NYS. I don't make the laws, and I'm not saying what he did is 100%, but the punishment should fit the crime. 10years and a sex offender registry is probably a minimum punishment for rape, and people get much less even doing that.

 There was a case here where a teacher slept with a student (actually a lady teacher) and the whole case was if it happened a few days before he was 17 or after :lol:. If it was after the cops said it is waste of our time. I think it got thrown out because they could never determine the date."

Chad will make his way into there. The only place left will be that island off the coast of India that kills missionaries if they try to go there. Imagine if an incel made it to that island. He would be seen as a god and would have his choice of the beautiful island women. Sure you‚Äôd have to learn their language. But you would live a life of enjoyment for the rest of your days with a woman who adores and loves you. Bliss. Utopia."
1171,,Legal age for consensual sex doesn't mean old enough to touch against her will. He did it twice and she ran away both times. He didn't speak. He only touched a strange girl and your defense is that she's old enough to fuck? He assaulted her the second time knowing she wanted nothing to do with him. She said he was smirking. It was also in a secluded area that he waited for her. That is not the same as oh they arrested him for touching her arm. Once again not being able to prove a crime doesn't justify another person doing it. Stop with bullshit excuses for bullshit behavior.

Its so fucking tiresome seeing these comics presenting incels as ugly when the same geniuses tend to keep telling incels looks dont matter. why isnt the ridiculous strawman caricature tall, wide framed and square jawed and fit instead of fat and ugly? it almost seems like looks do actually matter and its so very hard to effectively mock people without attacking their looks.

2. has the ""artist"" spent more than 5 minutes in any incel space? its a generally accepted axiom among incels that fatcel=volcel. this ""incels don't shower lmao"" idea also seems to be a pure projection coming from people with questionable hygienic habits themselves (=IncelTears) , and based on absolutely nothing. it's just another strawman attack to make the incel detractors feel good about themselves and like the world is a just place because incels are obviously so ridiculous they wear dirtied pedo anime tshirts outside."

1243,giantillusion,"As other people said, I think both comics are (kinda) correct. I personally relate more to the right one, but being part of incel subs and chats for a long time, there's definitely a radical and a moderate side to incels"
1244,I-N-S-T-A-L-L,"The first panel are the black-pilled men and the second panel are the ""tfw no gf"" men. Both are incels.

The principal fault of the first half isn't that the arguer is a strawman. There are plenty of people, like me, who think this way because we are incapable of looking away from reality and lying to ourselves. No, the principal fault is that the argument is a strawman by omission. The problem isn't that women date up, but that what they define as ""up"" is based primarily on things men can't control (e.g., height, face, and dick size). Meanwhile, men tend to have less stringent standards on what they define as ""up"", so the average woman has a more vibrant sex life than the average man.

On the second panel of the first half, when I, and others like me, say it's ""disgusting"", I'm being sarcastic. That shit is actually life fuel for me. But I know that, subconsciously, the vast majority of humanity will think this way, so I'm just echoing their sentiments as part of the joke.

At the same time if you decide to do that, you‚Äôre gonna have to be okay with some of their legitimate criticisms against incels and answer for a few of the shitty things people with the label you‚Äôd be representing have done.

Most couples are decently looks- and or life-matched. You wont find a fat ugly neet neeckbeard dating a successful fitness chick and all of us know why. So if one side of the couple is seemingly less attractive, ofc people might think about certain reasons why that is. Especially as a lonely guy there are times where you are sad and angry that this other dude that is similar or even worse looking/fat has a gf and you dont. (I think only very radical incels would think like the 2nd left picture)

About the 3rd pic in my opinion it is a bit laughable how some girls get away with just being ""normal"" while guys / their boyfriends are clearly putting much more work into it but its not something I often think or care about. The typical niceguy/neckbeard stereotype that is shown here is only rarely true and those people deserve to be alone.

Ive made some comics before and in a few of them I pointed out mental health problems. When they got posted on IncelTears, the reaction was always that the ITers said that the character in the comic who was depressed was also a misogynist fascist child rapist.

This kinda gives off the message that even if youre just identifying As an incel and you arent hateful at all, people will just accuse you of misogyny, rape, pedophilia, fascism, etc. So at this point whats the point in not being hateful, when you get the same treatment either way?

Also even if you exit the incel community, your life can still be ruined if someone finds your old account, even if you havent posted any hateful stuff. (A story like this was posted to IT once, OP was a woman proud of basically destroying his ex boyfriends life based on his old incel account, on wich he havent posted anything hateful)
So Whats the point in leaving than?


The whole attitude IncelTears has towards incels is exactly what traps incels in these spaces where only a very few not pick up the misogynistsic attitude.
And this is a huge problem, because you might say IncelTears isnt that big of a community, but millions of people get the definition of incel from inceltears, automatically making them think ""all incels""

This could be fixed by a stickied post on there addressing that not every incel is misogynistsic.
Im not saying they should promote inceldom or excuse the misogyny, im saying that the generalisation of such a diverse group As incels based on the worst, most delusional posts found on Incel.co isnt really healthy."

Where are you getting this statistic?"
1315,weirdshit777,How young are we talking about here? Because it's pretty typical for someone to not lose their virginity until they are around 20. I'd say 16-20 is the average age.

Don't let hate infect you, it only hurts yourself. Be a good example for inceldom.

I know this uses a somewhat looser standard, but given that its been long established men tend to lie and say they have more sex than they do (while women lie the opposite way), I think a quarter is a pretty good estimate."
1323,BlackestDusk,"[Age 18 to 30](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lpPQCfvc6yMX_dmg3r67e7h6Foc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4C7SSBIXSNFCLOJIGCWUOKDYTY.png).

The average age of virginity loss in the US is 17. Given this statistic inherently leads to extremes in the old side (i.e. it is possible for that to happen at 22, or even 32, but nearly impossible at 12), the ""typical"" age would be slightly lower than 17.

I live in the UK, where despite the ""stiff"" stereotypes, university accommodation is a complete sexfest for non-incels, and most people enter at around 18.

Incidentally, I remember reading in another study that in western Europe, the average female at the same age range (18-30) tend to have had at least 10-12 sex partners."

1330,br1847,"""I havent seen a red boat in my life, therefore red boats dont exist""

No, you havent seen a swole incel because actual incels never reveal that theyre an incel because it could easily destroy their life."
1331,weirdshit777,"I don't think that's a good statistic. A person who hasn't had sex in the past year is not an incel. An incel is someone who has NEVER had sex and is unable to through normal means. And personally, I think if your below the age of like 24, I don't think you can truly know for sure whether you are an incel or not. You may have a good idea, but there's still a lot of hope being so young. (See below)

Here's a statistic I found- (This is in the US, btw)
https://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/how-many-people-die-virgins-never-have-sex.htm

""Between 12-14% of adults have never had sex between the ages of 20-24""

""Only 5% of people have never had sex between the ages of 25-29""

Notice the huge drop? 

""And around the age 44, only 0.3% report never having sex.""

Personally, I think 25% of all young men being incels is just you huge of a stretch, and just not realistic. BUT in some countries such as Japan, that may be the case. 

""By contrast, in 2010, 25 percent of unmarried Japanese men over the age of 30¬†reported being virgins.""

I'm sure teenage boys might be somewhere around the 25% mark, but I wouldn't call them incels."
1332,BlackestDusk,"Like, a quarter of young males of involuntarily celibate. Thinking all incels are that hateful stereotype is like thinking all Muslims are jihadists."

It doesn't exclude prostitution though. I live in the UK and I suspect the US is also similar in that alcoholism and drug abuse are widespread and also leads to plenty of sexual encounters otherwise not possible ""through normal means""...although at this point I'm starting to think a lot of people consider this normal means..."

Because a guy asked for her phone number (or social media, whatever) she acted like her life was in danger?

GTFO with that shit. A guy thought you were attractive and was interested in going out with you. And you cry that YOUR LIFE WAS IN LITERAL DANGER?

STUPID FUCKING BS. Polite, gentle rejection is one thing, but this kind of reaction is WAY OVERBLOWN. 

A guy thinking a girl is cute and wanting her to go out with him on a date does not automatically equal him being a serial killer rapist or something.

For all I know, he was just a shy, troubled guy (based on her age I assume he was her age, so MAYBE 18?) just trying to work up the courage to ask someone he‚Äôs attracted to out, trying to break out of his shell, and your reaction is LITERALLY ‚ÄúI RAN FOR MY LIFE, I WAS SO SCARED!‚Äù

Absolutely illogical, what has the world come too???

KILLER RAPIST!

I was a bit older than most of the students so I‚Äôd had social experience out in the real world and never had anyone anyone treat me so rudely.  If you‚Äôre still in your college years, just remember that most of the women in these universities are incredibly immature.  The type who do this aren‚Äôt very bright and seem to think they‚Äôre little princesses.  I assume you‚Äôre in the US?  It‚Äôs just a bad culture here.  The women in these universities have been puffed up by their bourgeois parents, have no experience outside of that bubble and think it‚Äôs okay to be rude to perfect strangers.  The girl who tried this with me first got up to use the restroom after I‚Äôd sat down to study.  I got up shortly after for some water and passed her on the way back.  She gave me the dirtiest look, but I simply smirked in return and gave her a little shoulder check to let her know her behavior had no effect on me.  I returned, sat down completely unperturbed and returned to my studies, completely ignoring her.  She got up in a huff and left shortly after.

You don‚Äôt have to let these people make you feel bad about yourself.  Don‚Äôt hate them, but let them know this sort of thing has no effect on you.  You‚Äôre at school to enrich your mind and improve your lot in life, and it‚Äôs completely unacceptable to be subjected to this sort of abuse.  That‚Äôs what it is.  You need to have some courage and assert your right to be present.  I think this is probably what a lot of women refer to when they mention ‚Äútoxic masculinity.‚Äù  For most men, if they don‚Äôt assert themselves, they open themselves up to this sort of behavior.  If you cultivate an air of completely not caring what anyone thinks of you, it helps a lot in dealing with these situations."

1504,Saddam420,Very nice. Next month I am coming up on six years since my last hug so I'm not gonna lie this is pretty painful to read now. I had a horrific caffeine-induced panic attack in public last semester and nearby was a big group of business school undergrad kids. They came over to help when my legs wouldn't hold me up and I wound up coiled to the fire hydrant like a boa constrictor trying to soothe myself (and maybe open the thing to attempt a self-baptism?) and two of them were girls that both rubbed my back and it was helpful.
1505,Mr-PoopyBhole,Hey I‚Äôm happy for you man any progress is good 
1506,BraisedBuster,"Happy for you, my man. Sounds awesome "
1507,Muffcakelord,"Getting compliments on your smell is basically as intimate as a hug too, congrats!"
1508,MotherOfLogic,"It was the fragrance and your approach. Just right. Keep at it, and act suave/reserved, she'll grow fonder. "
1509,BlackHeart357,"Hey man, small steps! One thing is for sure. If she thought you were gross, she def would never hug you. It's a start, right? :)

&#x200B;

Progress, not perfection."
1510,Unknown_Predator88,Save some pussy for the rest of us chad
1511,H20cel,Congrats man! That‚Äôs awesome
1512,NeckMasseuse,"That's nice, but if youre very unattractive AND socially awkward, she was probably being nice.

It is nice, and comfort is good, but dont go dreaming up romantic fantasies.

In my experience, a lot of people (men or women) get a kick out of being generous, it doesnt mean they like you romantically or in a platonic since, even that they'd stand by you when things get tough.

Just wanted to taper your expectations, take care!"
1513,thenameofshame,"I don't want to artificially get your hopes up, because it IS possible that she is just one of those people who is unusually friendly and a rampant hugger, but to me as a woman, those are some pretty strong indicators of interest.  The only other reason I could think of is if you actually sit at her tables frequently and give her huge tips, although even in that case she could very well still be interested in you.

The fact that she essentially said that she missed you and that you smell good are the reasons why I think this, even more than the fact that she hugged you.  I don't know any woman who would act in that specific manner and NOT be somewhat interested.  Those were actions she did spontaneously without you asking for them and without you being sad and her pitying you or anything like that.

It might sound a little weird, but I also congratulate you for paying such close attention to her behavior and picking up on these signals.  My boyfriend had Asperger's, and he literally had his female roommate undressing in front of him trying to get his romantic interest because nothing else she was doing was working.  He was completely blind to these obvious cues, and it happened with a couple of other women too.  

I am quite familiar with the restaurant business in general, and it is pretty frequent for staff members to socialize after work by having a few drinks together at their bar.  One relatively low risk way to spend more time with her and gauge her interest would be to ask her if she'd like to have a drink when her shift is over (or coffee if it's a day shift).  If she agrees to get a drink together, that's a decent clue that she is interested.  If she says something like ""maybe"" or ""I'm really busy right now so..."" or something hesitant like that, then she is likely NOT interested."
1514,glassangelrose,That's awesome! Maybe try to hang out with her more? Do you guys have any common interests?

1519,pauly1993,"Good for you man, next time you do get the chance to hug her include a small compliment, her hair, make-up, maybe a watch or peice of jewelry she has on and guarantee it'll make her smile which will make you smile and may give you a chance for more small talk which could even evolve to a full conversation."
1520,alajameen,Here‚Äôs to more hugs my man 
1521,anxietycel_hopecel,"She told you that you smelled good. That's all the IOI you need, you're already in. In her mind she has accepted you as a potential mate but it won't last long. If you don't act soon it will be too late, she will lose interest in you if you don't have the confidence to go after what you want. Decide what you want to do with her then try and make it happen, smoothly.

It doesn't matter if you fuck it up and humiliate yourself, you need the experience of trying so that the next one will be easier. And if a girl is telling you that you smell good then there WILL be another girl that feels the same eventually (as long as you don't let yourself go)."

1561,SpiritDCRed,"I don‚Äôt really know if getting into the habit of giving people hugs is the best idea. The goal isn‚Äôt to collect hugs, it‚Äôs for people to be comfortable enough around you to build a friendship and possibly a relationship. Hugging people on a regular basis doesn‚Äôt seem like the most normal thing to do, and the only people I know who did that ended up being recognized as quite odd."
1562,nmaddine,sexual harassment accusations incoming...
1563,Rammspieler,"I don't know. I've never encountered a non-wealthy, non-famous ugly dude with a girlfriend in real life before."
1564,,"Maybe they were naturally odd or felt weird doing it...If so. ...then a hug is going to come across as odd

If it's natural for you...its natural for them....if its awkward for you...its awkward for them 

The goal is not to collect hugs...its to become comfortable and feel natural giving them out...which isn't possible if you are ashamed of hugging people....only way to get over a fear is to face it

I'm not gonna pretend that this would be an easy thing to get the hang of if some one is awkward. Like developing any new skill there is an initial cringe barrier to get over. Like it took me a while to get used to kiss on cheek as a greeting in south America...it wasn't normal by my culture....but when i returned home i would still sometimes cheek kiss greet strangers despite it not being a cultural norm 

And of course....use due diligence as to who to hug and when to hug and when not to...dont have to hug absolutely everyone . i didn't kiss absolutely everyone. Deoends on circumstance and social setting.

And last but not least....there are 2 ways to get to the truth... Experience or Theory. You can theorize what will or will not work or you can theorize based on other people's experience (which may or may not be fully competently executed ), but most reliable is testing stuff based on your own experience....and that requires a bit of trial and error and an initial sucky period....until you develop a natural ability.....and that assumes that experimenting is conducted competently and thoroughly and not just give up after a few failed attempts. "
1565,___XANDER___,Have you met many working class married men? Some of em look like alcoholic prunes and yet they have happy marriages and kids
1566,SpiritDCRed,"I‚Äôm not an incel, I‚Äôm just lurking out of curiosity and thought I‚Äôd put in my .02. I hug people on a daily basis, but they‚Äôre my family and my girlfriend, and sometimes close friends if I haven‚Äôt seen them in a while. I just thought that might be a risky move for some, especially because the incels I know irl are not very socially comfortable. 

Perhaps this is a result of the culture in my area. Who knows."
1567,Rammspieler,Then they must be running dark triad gene game.
1568,,"It's most likely a cultural thing...dont know where you are from but when i visited Canada...even hugs were received awkwardly by a lot of girls....i didn't care, i did it anyway because its part of who i am...its not my issue if someone finds it awkward...its their issue to deal with. 

It's definitely risky....and you never know who is or isn't going to feel awkward....and its definitely more difficult for socially uncomfortable people....i don't anticipate that many people will try this....but its a fact that emotional freedom cannot be found inside your comfort zone. ..infact everything your heart desires is outside of your comfort zone.  And we only achieve the life we want by pushing boundaries and risking embarrassment....and experiencing awkwardness "

One thing I DO have a problem with over there are the gatekeepers and the virgin bashers.  It used to be much worse and they're not the majority anymore, but it's still a problem occasionally.   I LMAO at the gatekeepers who claim you ""gotta have dating experience to be a MGTOW"".  Such bullshit.  The problems in the dating game are so bleeding obvious today that even a kissless virgin can see it.  You can learn a lot just from outside observation, and the guy who learns from OTHERS' mistakes is a lot smarter than the guy who has to actually go through it before waking up.

You don't see why it is wrong to use and abuse humans? Seriously, the more I read the more it is not surprising me that dating is as fucked as it is nowadays.

However mgtow has also become a community where men discuss issues of all kinds and of course that will include issues of feminism and female behavior because that's basically defining our lives nowadays.

Sorry but society has rid me of the ability to care."

1657,,"Why dont any females see any issue with women receiving mens money through dating, or the friend zone. Do you think all men are so unintelligent that we dont realise you extract resources from men in the friendzone and then keep men there?"
1658,Ricardosousa95,Therefore they were not incels in the first place. Don't project insecurities
1659,wiseguyx1,So mgtow are obsessed with women lol Manginas Gathering Together Online Whining.
1660,UrMomma4,"Well that's just sad.  I was sexually abused by my father and uncle.  I grew up poor and in a horrible toxic environment.  BUT I don't extrapolate my experiences with men to every single man.  I have been shit on so many times that it has done the opposite to me as it has for you.  I don't want to see anyone hurt the way that I have been hurt.  I know how it affected me, and I think it is evil to do it to others.  Pain and hurt and apathy will only lead to more pain, hurt and apathy.  We all choose how we want to be.  It sounds like you let life destroy you.  You sound weak."
1661,wiseguyx1,Mgtows dont have a backbone. That's why they need other low tier men to tell them how to live.
1662,lostwanderer28,">Just take away women's rights theory.

Nope, that is not what religion is about."
1663,lostwanderer28,">The things that you and I think of as degenerate are no longer thought of as degenerate by society. Stop calling facts ""ironic"".

If more people would think it is not OK then something could change. But no, just keep following the other sheeps."

1665,neubs,Religion and marriage was made obsolete during WW2 when we realized women could be in the workplace too.  Now it only exists in the same way we still use horses for fun now instead of pulling a wagon or plowing a field.

just change society theory...

>But no, just keep following the other sheeps. 

I don't think you understand what ""following the other sheep"" means. If everyone is breathing, you have to breathe. If every employer needs a college degree, you have to get a college degree to get employed. ""following the sheep"" would mean trying to betabux an old, overweight female with absurdly high bodycount, which no incel is currently doing. Given that you're on an incel subreddit, I think it is safe to assume you don't have money, connections or power to implement the large scale societal changes that you wish to implement. Your entire proposal is : ""lets just believe enough in our own values so hard that society starts adopting our values"".

You lack the self awareness to understand the blackpill and you fail to consider that the rest of society does not give a shit.

If this was bait, it's pretty good."
