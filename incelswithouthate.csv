Also, you're a good looking dude, OP. Just a bit overweight and not the best grooming for conventional attractiveness."

We can come off as insensitive at a glance (in my case, when I say something without thinking about how it will be received), but we're actually more caring and empathetic than most.

Incel wasn't a popular (compared to now) term for my teen/college years, but my boyfriend says he definitely would have identified with the community if it existed before he met me. I was attracted initially to his sense of humor and obvious intelligence, and we've been together happily for 11 years as of August.

176,chalkandapples,"\> Isn‚Äôt it obvious enough that if you‚Äôre at least 18 years old and still a virgin that it‚Äôs because most women find you repulsive and that you‚Äôre a confirmed incel?

My brother and most his friends didn't even start dating until 20-21. Later parts of college when they're stable with their career (got good internships or an offer out of college). He did nothing except play video games with his friends throughout high school and was too busy trying to secure employment out of school early parts of college, and then suddenly got interested in girls after all that. I would say looks wise he's above average but still within normie range. He's VERY sweet and gentlemanly though. Like we used to role play pokemon and he would always let me be the stronger / type advantage pokemon so I can win and be happy, and he's my LITTLE brother so if anything I would be letting him win. 

I had problems dating because I'm very asocial and avoidant, but normal people like my brother and friends find relationships very naturally. Similarly it's much easier for him to walk into a social event or party and come out of it with new friends, while it's very hard for me to just make friends from one interaction."
177,This_Makes_Me_Happy,">Isn‚Äôt it obvious enough that if you‚Äôre at least 18 years old and still a virgin that it‚Äôs because most women find you repulsive and that you‚Äôre a confirmed incel?

179,PiStaker_writes,"Honestly neither one of you are wrong on this.

Earlier this year I read a study (I forget from where) on sex & it said 1/3 of people (or at least Americans) under 30 have never had sex (males 31% females 28%)

I believe the reason it‚Äôs skyrocketing is because of modern day American culture (ie the weird social alliance between Christian evangelicals & SJWs) mixed with a terrible economy"
180,ufixusif,Your IQ must be too low then.
181,chalkandapples,"I honestly think it has to do with the fact that we have a ton of more entertainment. We're not bored enough to desperately want to pair up and make kids. Relationships and kids are hard, there are a ton of entertainment that's easier to get and less stressful. It's much easier and simpler to spend a night playing my favorite video game than a first date. At the same time, stuff that's harder to get is more fulfilling and eventually might lead to more. But often we don't realize that, or the pain doesn't get as bad until we're older and got tired of cheap entertainment. 

I say this because I get into a lot of discussions with my parents/grandparents since I was single for so long, and they said when they were my age they really had nothing else to do other than start a family. Even job wise things were simple, they got a job and just kept working at it and they're promoted mostly based on seniority."
182,This_Makes_Me_Happy,I bet that sounded like something coherent in your head
183,Orange_Sticker,out
184,Saddam420,"Not a bad effort. Most of this reduces to things that have been posted by normies on incel communities many times before, but I do like that you were so honest here:

>Meeting people is just a matter of odds.

The IT will hate this truth the most, because it destroys their ability to weaponize accusations of ""bad personality."" In fact, if they were able to grasp this and follow it to its conclusion, they would apologize to us and shut down their sub immediately. (If you start getting racist private messages from sock puppet accounts, it's from IT users.)

Also some advice for your advice: Don't make the 'ball rolling' part so dependent on alcohol because many here are on psychiatric medications that interact severely with alcohol, and inviting someone to go drink alcohol and then proceeding to not drink alcohol yourself is potentially problematic in many ways."
185,,">**You don't go fishing to catch fish**,

I can get behind this however,

&#x200B;

> **don't talk to people only because you want something from them**. 

People have agendas, wants and needs. It's just part of human behaviour (selfishness, cynicism). And some people just are not that sociable to get pleasure out of talking to people and being friendly for it's own sake. So you're saying don't talk to people because you have some kind of intention (like to build up your social network, meet more women and that kind of thing) but realistically you can't quash the desire. It's going to be there.

&#x200B;

>**Don't try to impress people**. 

Again, this isn't something that necessarily works in a superficial society. People form first impressions about people all the time based on how you walk and talk, how you present yourself, what kind of job you have. People who are purely superficial are just as rare as people who purely judge others based only on what's inside. Most people are somewhere inbetween those two extremes, so realistically you need to have a blendure of traits that will appeal to both personality types. You talk about ""things that worked for me"" but realistically, you are probably neglecting to talk about ***other*** things that might have worked for you like going to the gym, focussing on your career, focussing on the way you walk, talk and present yourself, improving your looks and style, those kinds of more materialistic qualities.

&#x200B;

>**Meeting people is just a matter of odds** 

Luck plays a role but it is by no means the only important factor. People tend to form cliques and put up social barriers against lone wolves, introverts, shy types and folks with mental health issues or physical defects. That is a barrier that has to be overcome and it is not purely accomplished by going out more which can help but is also a double edged sword (more on this).

&#x200B;

>**""Hey, wanna grab a beer this week?""** 

I understand this has to be contextualised, e.g. in a conversation where you have already built rapport with someone. But if we take this at face value alone, it's not really a suggestion that brings much value. My one is ""would you like to get a coffee some time"" but I use it mostly because I can't think of anything better. I mean there is a world of interesting and fun activities like tennis, salsa, restaurants, theatres and so on. Is getting a drink really the only suggestion you can make to someone? How are you going to make your invitation sound appealing? This person is going to spend time with you so they want to know they will get value rather than just having value leeched off them. How are you going to build up to this kind of invitation? What ways can you be innovative and sound interesting? Just asking people out to drinks is something that more often than not will get a ""sorry but I'm busy this week, maybe some other time though"" type of response. Like I said, I use it but I don't think it should be presented as the optimal strategy at all.

&#x200B;

>*Take yourself on dates*

This is something that is a double edged sword.  Doing this you can build up a foundation for engaging in interesting activities and being an interesting person but you can also be seen as ""that guy"" who's always by himself when you go to these places where hopefully you will also be interested in building up a basis for networking.

&#x200B;

>Being a well-rounded human being is crucial to a good conversation. TV and video games give you very little to talk about. 

Ok, yes I can't disagree with this one. But being good at conversation requires more than just having a wide array of interests. You will need to be good at wit which requires abstract logic. You will need other psychological skills that involve shifting conversations towards subjects you are good at discussing, introducing fascinating anecdotes and in general just being good at improvisation. So having interests is definitely one component of being a good conversationalist but it undermines what actually goes into the art as a whole.

&#x200B;

>It's fine to ask for a glass of water, to say ""dude, that was mean"" or ""please stop interrupting me"". 

Sure but people who do this can also have difficulties socialising. In fact it can come across as an anal, highly  strung-out personality type if you do it all the time. Which is often what happens when guys listen to too much PUA and self-improvement related stuff.

&#x200B;

>*No More Mr Nice Guy*. Every incel should read this book. It really helped me spin things around and realize *I* was being manipulative. 

This is something that makes me sad to hear. Guys can have be non-manipulative and have genuinely good traits but suffer socially and with women regardless. Talking about and complaining of issues you have ***in spite of*** genuinely good traits is something that is often mischaracterised as something that must be non-assertive as well as manipulative which is totally not necessarily the case at all. The *No More Mr Nice Guy* book began a very bad stereotype about ""nice guys"" as manipulative, validation seeking and non-assertive which wasn't fair at all. And it is often recommended as a ""go to resource"" now for men who struggle with women, socialising or other areas in life, where the assumption tends to be that if you struggle in these areas you must be manipulative, validation seeking and non-assertive. Very unhelpful.

&#x200B;

> *How to win friends and influence people*. It's just a great manual on how to deal with other human beings 

I'm sorry but it is not. It is a great manual on how to be a socially subservient ""Yes Man"". In the book Carnegie literally recommends never criticising people or only indirectly so, which does not account for situations where a person may be engaging in destructive behaviour that is potentially dangerous. This is just an example. He also says ""never argue"" or try to prove your right which again doesn't account for many nuanced situations where you may well need to demonstrate correctness if another person is going to engage in potentially foolish behaviour that may harm himself, others or you. There are more instances of passive behaviour and cheesy/forced positivity stuff that really is not particularly helpful at all in that book.

&#x200B;

>*The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F\*\*k*. Optional read. The first chapter (which is free) should be enough. It gets repetitive after that.

I haven't read it. But life requires that people ""give a fuck"".

&#x200B;

My friend's gf once told me she gravitates toward me in social situations bc I make her feel safe (weird thing to say but still cool). I have a really wide set of interests which allow me to go talk Russian history with the nerds in my office, interpersonal drama with the old ladies, share stories with the sales people, and business with the managers.

This is the best list of advice for incels I've ever seen, and I agree with every point on here. Not sure if you've already come across this, but I would focus on trying to emmulate this as much as possible. Basically, stop living in your own head thinking it's impossible to make connections, and focus on being happy with yourself first and foremost. Once you accomplish that, the rest will literally fall into place without much effort. Making lasting connections, platonicaly and romantically, starts with you building love for yourself. Without that, you will continue to fail. "

I wasn't interested - I wanted to do things with people because I wanted to do those things, play Catan, go swimming, go for a road trip, go to an amusement park, and I would always go as a group, and there would always be some girl trying to get my attention

I was happy - One of the most attractive quality's in someone, is that they are happy without you, they dont need you, they are living their best life

Stop thinking about women, stop trying to chase them, do shit that makes you happy, and I mean genuinely happy, not I played 13 hours of video games happy.

It's going to be there.

You could always try a different sort of agenda. Like being motivated to talk to people in order to improve your social skills and gain some confidence.

Besides, when it comes to more social situations, when you risk embarrassing yourself in front of people, it helps to remember, that those people:

* will hardly remember your face or name

* even if your failure was so memorable and hilarious that it won't be completely pushed out of their memory, those people don't have to be a part of your life after that day

I don't think anyone seriously considers that it is a bad thing to be able to branch out with different women who can introduce you to their female friends and so forth. It's just that platonic, socially-subservient and ""yes man"" traits tend not to have that effect anyway. If you take ownership of your intentions rather than trying to be the guy who does things just for their own sake and the pleasures of social niceties and all the rest, ironically you will probably find it a lot harder to get connected with the right friendship nodes in a society that is competitive and individualistic. That's where the advice falls behind and is probably what people ***actually*** mean when they talk about the ""friendzone""."

Really? Then i guess i'm extraordinarily lucky because this happens to be pretty often and i'm not particularly attractive. People do however tell me that i give them the impression of being a calm and safe person to confront and i receive praise for being content when by myself.

>For a community which is ""incels without hate"" where the men are clearly already trying to distinguish their group from large scale misconceptions, that is absolutely not a valid or fair assumption to make.

Disagree strongly. People on here post about being dishearted because people wrongly assume their intentions. Obviously they could need some advice on this.

Yes, exactly! That is the point



>You haven't really shown what the positive aspects are.

OP did. I won't take the time to explain to you in detail since OP did that excellently, but i can tell you the key aspects i get from this exact advice.

Self-dating: i feel appreciated and valued, i sometimes meet new people this way and experience new things.

Being selfless when meeting people: people feel comfortable with me and i never get sour when new people/strangers don't return my gestures.

Not giving a fuck: this is about picking battles, though. People instantly get the feeling that i don't judge and i speak my mind so they easily feel safe with me. People used to use me for this, but now i catch on to this and i just tell them how i feel about thst because i don't give a fuck if people will dislike me for who i am. If i lose someone i appreciate, heartbreak is a close friend and i know how to deal with pain. It's better than to give too many fucks.

>We also try our best to censor personal information including usernames and are against doxxing.

I think this goal is achieved. The dark side of this moon, is that in many cases I doubt, that the quoted examples are real at all, because there is no source given with them. Sometimes I assume that the quoted shit is indeed invented by IT users themselves. And to be strict, even if these examples are copied from braincels, it is still possible that they have been placed there by an IT user in order to further ridicule incels. But ruling out such skulduggery is out of scope of the mods.

Therefore let's consider the more obvious misbehavior as mentioned before, this time partly with source:

1. A bulk of 1100 IT users advocate blaming incels for desecration of dead bodies [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/98z2m8/what\_kind\_of\_expetiment\_is\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/98z2m8/what_kind_of_expetiment_is_it/)
2. A braincel post was quoted and actively ""enriched"" with the idea of  rape, just in order to once again accuse and ridicule incels. [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/99dx3c/incel\_cant\_understand\_why\_rape\_is\_bad\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/99dx3c/incel_cant_understand_why_rape_is_bad_and/)
3. Urging to suicide and bullying glorifying IT posts, collected by another user: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/95t5qq/it\_doesnt\_want\_to\_help\_incels\_they\_want\_us/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/95t5qq/it_doesnt_want_to_help_incels_they_want_us/)
4. Several times I tried to reasonably and modestly discuss with IT users. Never possible.
5. As sure as there is the amen in the church, any user in IT who tries to defend one aspect of incels, is downvoted. This happened not to just me.
6. Once there was the claim, that incels generally do not pay their taxes. I objected, that this judgement is not fair, and that I always paid my taxes. Immediate 40 downvotes.
7. A man left IncelTears because ""I can‚Äôt take it anymore"". The posts in this subreddit made him fear for the fate of his daughter. ""The mentality of an incel is sickening and frightening and to know that she could be one bad conversation away from being raped or murdered by one of them gives me panic attacks."" This is the result of this perpetual toxic rain falling from the IncelTears cloud. [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/995b3u/why\_i\_am\_leaving\_inceltears/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/995b3u/why_i_am_leaving_inceltears/)
8. One gets the impression that not only that all incels are rapist, but even worse, that all rapists are incels.
9. While there is hatred in Braincels against women, it is based of real personal bitter experience of their members. On the other hand the hatred in IncelTears against incels is mostly taken out of fresh air, based only on some idiotic utterances on the Internet. Most of these hateful IT user do not even know one incel in person.
10. The hatred of Braincel users is diffusely spread over half of humanity, while the hatred of IncelTears users is focused on a minority, the incel, which are suffering anyway from life. That makes quite a difference in severeness and pain it induces."

375,,"Main points is that human attraction is based mostly if not entirely on your appearance/sex appeal. If you lack that you cannot get a partner no matter what you do. IE if you're ugly you'll die alone with no hope to experiencing intimacy/sex without either paying for it (which wouldn't solve the incel issue since there is no love and the person you pay obviously does not like you or want to do it willingly, just for money) or having to get extreme reconstructive surgery to drastically altar your appearance to potentially attracting someone. 

Many examples of women taking interest in criminals because they are physically attractive whilst ugly men are shown to be either ignored or simply used as a means of monetary gain.   
When all this info comes to people who all their lives were led to believe women were all collectively these kind/gentle beings and that all you gotta do to get one's affection is to simply be a stand-up/well hearted person  only to learn that was all a lie, it can be VERY detrimental to a person's mind, emotions and overall outlook.  
It's a mixture of disbelief, confusion, anger/frustration that makes you question everything you thought was true, ON TOP OF knowing you aren't and will never be good enough.

379,BlackMoonstorm,"Exactly. However, you get painted over with the same brush because you are complicit in allowing these things to be said.

And as for the 2nd point, there are plenty of people that are willing to help as long as you help yourself. The main issue is the steadfastness on how the world works.

380,BlackMoonstorm,"Hey there. Not a mod. Just a user who cares about the community. Thanks! I‚Äôm glad we are now able to have a civil discussion. A few points I would like to mention. 
1. Some people fake crap for karma. It happens. 
2. Some people don‚Äôt understand nuance and just bandwagon. That also happens.
3. Some people believe that all bad things are caused by the incels. That is not true, but some people still believe that. They shouldn‚Äôt and is a poor judgement on their part.
4. If the subreddit scared him, he should honestly leave and will make no attempt to bring him back. But the world is, unfortunately, a very scary place where a lot of bad things happen.
5. Hating more people doesn‚Äôt make it any better. Hatred of any group is a problem.
6. If somebody seriously says some of the things said on braincels, it makes sense that people would be concerned. I don‚Äôt know David Duke in real life but I know from his uttering on the internet that he is a bad person.

382,BlackMoonstorm,I feel like it‚Äôs more that the people are. Bandwagoning happens and it sucks. Some people just don‚Äôt get nuance and misuse power. I‚Äôm sorry about that experience. 
383,Iswallowedafly,"I see incels bully and harass other incels on a daily basis and this is support by incels subs. 


Why is that tolerated? "
384,BlackMoonstorm,"Well when it‚Äôs phrased like that, it makes sense that they would all be so emotionally charged. However, I feel like some of these core beliefs are just off. Mainly the whole focus on ‚Äúwomen seek power and good looks and nothing else‚Äù bit. Remember, women are people too. The whole ‚Äúhypergamy‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt seem so strange if you reverse the role; if the princess of some country was in love with you, you would want to marry up if you could. And a lot of the time the whole ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù thing isn‚Äôt as clear-cut as it seems. Some of these people are actually good to them, even if they are standoffish jerks to everyone else. And sometimes it‚Äôs just honestly poor decision-making that comes with regrets. Lastly, appearance is NOT static no matter what you look like. Anyone can always shave, comb, exercise, wear nicer clothes, and change some little things. But it seems like for some of these people, they would rather blame something out of their control than put in hard work to keep themselves in a good position. It is a grim reality, but only if you think it is reality. Make sure to talk to a therapist if you need to."
385,browsingpornignoreme,In my book you're doing a pretty good job already!
386,Stormypwns,"You're right there. I'm not exactly in the same boat as most incels, as I do have some friends with whom I socialize regularly (I do have a job after all) but know that a lot of incels don't, and a good amount of them are agoraphobes, or would find a space like that threatening. My point isn't so much pertaining to myself so much as trying to help you understand the position that some of us are in. 

The fact is that despite your own good will, the majority (and I must stress that we're not just talking about the vocal few) on IT condone shaming and bullying incels. Sure, they're fucked in the head. You're right, but what IT does and perpetuates isn't helping anyone and is entirely detrimental. 

The purpose of the sub to begin with is to spread hate by shaming mentally ill people who obviously need some kind of help, if only an end to their misery. To IT's credit, there is quite a bit of encouraging us to commit suicide, which is fair enough. 

My point is that you take issue with the misogyny, hate, and perpetuation of violence that incels spread, while actively defending a group that majorly and by design perpetuates violence against incels under the pretense that ""Oh we're not all like that."" when infact that is what the sub was intended to be.

If you want to say we deserve more suffering, to kill ourselves, to be round up and shot, then fair enough. That's your opinion and you're welcome to it, I'm not even too inclined to say that it's the wrong one. At that point, however, you have to relinquish your moral high ground and realize that while operating on what is certain to be a drastically higher plane of intelligence quotient than us incels, IT still has the animalistic human desire to hurt and put others below themselves, wherever their conscience will allow."

389,quercusp,">1. Some people fake crap for karma. It happens.

Maybe, but this excuse is clearly not applicable here: 1100 upvotes for a hateful claim, means 1100 hateful people on IncelTears. Period.

This excuse only applies to IncelTears?

>3. Some people believe that all bad things are caused by the incels. That  is not true, but some people still believe that. They shouldn‚Äôt and is a  poor judgement on their part.

Some people believe that all bad things are caused by the *women*. That  is not true, but some people still believe that. They shouldn‚Äôt and is a  poor judgement on their part.

>4. If the subreddit scared him, he should honestly leave and will make no  attempt to bring him back. But the world is, unfortunately, a very scary  place where a lot of bad things happen.

If a subreddit scared *her*, *she* should honestly leave and will make no  attempt to bring *her* back. But the world is, unfortunately, a very scary  place where a lot of bad things happen.

See what I mean, why not applying this same reasoning to for example Braincels and leave these people there in peace?

>5. Hating more people doesn‚Äôt make it any better. Hatred of any group is a problem.

So why tolerate the hatred in IncelTears and not that in other subreddits?

390,Board_Gaming,"Misogyny and sexism exists all over Reddit, yes."
391,,"""The whole ‚Äúhypergamy‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt seem so strange if you reverse the role; if the princess of some country was in love with you, you would want to marry up if you could.""

No I wouldn't and most incels wouldn't either. It goes against their own beliefs of things like social status being an irrelevant trait. Even if I did, this argument is terrible since it's just some way to make it seem like it's ok for them be lonely and miserable because ""well u kno ppl wanna all d8 kings/queens bro"".

""But it seems like for some of these people, they would rather blame something out of their control than put in hard work to keep themselves in a good position. It is a grim reality, but only if you think it is reality. Make sure to talk to a therapist if you need to.""

Any person with an IQ above a single digit would rather not. Why would you put a bunch of effort for nothing? That thing out of your control determines the quality of your life as well? Also what ""good"" position? There were never in one lol."
392,,"And what next? Every new social opportunity I get myself into I expect to be different but it's literally the same story since puberty.

My friends don't put themelves ""out there"" as much a I do because they aren't bottom whatever percent of male attractiveness. They've met their gfs through class or through mutual friends or a random hookup at a wedding. Nothing I do will ever yield those results - I've been doing those things for years and they've never gotten me anywhere close. What am I supposed to do? Same thing for the next 7 years until I'm 30 and some woman is sad enough to deal with me?  If no woman likes me now at 23 when every woman is looking for some guy, any woman who might like me later on must be out of desperation."
393,BlackMoonstorm,"As I‚Äôve stated before, suicide is not the answer. Originally, from what I can tell, the point of the sub was to make sure the ideology didn‚Äôt run rampant and uncontested in the market of ideas. Even though many people just bandwagon onto any group that‚Äôs against another group just to hate, from what I can tell that wasn‚Äôt the point of this subreddit.

And yes, I‚Äôm all in favor of people getting mental help. I‚Äôm sure most of us wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with the people themselves outside of their ideas. Why do you think incels complain so much that everyone says that they have a ‚Äúbad personality‚Äù? These people ostracized themselves, and the best answer is to get mental help. 

Nobody deserves to suffer, and being hateful because of self-loathing doesn‚Äôt fix anything. I haven‚Äôt heard anyone say they actively or passively wanted to commit an act of violence against anyone with the ideology because of the ideology. We aren‚Äôt against people getting mental help. We don‚Äôt hate the people. We are opposed to the ideas that stem from the damaged worldview that a large collective of people who need mental help have thought up. The original use of ‚ÄúIncel‚Äù was on a board to help the community before it spiraled out of control. If and when we hear that somebody is dropping the incel mindset through therapy, we don‚Äôt scream at them to get back to their hole. We support them and try to help them to rehumanize the people around them. 

TL;DR: Hateful people exist everywhere. People misuse power too. However, a group can still be good even if a majority of its members are not. "

395,BlackMoonstorm,"Suicide doesn‚Äôt fix the problem. It does guarantee that you will never get better, though. And what exactly are you apathetic about? And remember that unfortunately sometimes self improvement is forcing yourself to do crap that you hate in the short term to help in the long term."
396,BlackMoonstorm,"From what I can tell, 1100 is much less than the total number of subscribers to the subreddit. And this was about people faking posts.

The difference in the lack of nuance between IT and braincels is rather large. 

You made my point for me on number 3.

But IT say things that are actually true, not just peoples‚Äô world views.

I dislike the hatred on both sides. But disagreeing with an ideology does not mean hating everyone with that ideology.

A popular incel claim of self-defense is ‚Äúhow do they know we have bad personalities and aren‚Äôt just horribly ugly?‚Äù People on braincels have advocated for rape, incest, and pedophilia. David Duke is the current leader of the KKK. I‚Äôm not saying that incels are racist, but saying things equivalently hateful doesn‚Äôt look too good.

EDIT: Btw hatred does not justify more hatred. Saying that IT is hateful doesn‚Äôt mean that braincels gets the ‚Äúmean pass‚Äù too."
397,BlackMoonstorm,"I‚Äôm not saying they deserve to be miserable, but blaming women for all of it isn‚Äôt the right answer.

And this may come as a shock, but most of these ‚Äúhideous monsters‚Äù look perfectly fine, though they may not stand out. Your looks have far less of an impact on most things in life than other factors. E.G.

428,unknownhorrorwriter,"I have. I do it all the time and constantly post on various subs.

Regardless of how people wanna spin it, men have low self-esteem and body issues too. And I say this as a nice-looking guy with a big dick. I struggle with low self-esteem everyday. I don‚Äôt talk to women well, was bullied growing up, called ugly and creepy by women the majority of the time I tried to ask them out. I mean I‚Äôm not sure what the fuck people expect? The reality is as a woman, no matter how unattractive or ugly you are, you can make a Bumble or Tinder and collect hundreds of matches from hotter guys in minutes. Instant ego boost.

As a man on the same level, or even an unconventionally-handsome one like me, we don‚Äôt have that luxury. Instead, we stare at empty inboxes while women naturally gravitate to the smoking hot dudes. So yeah, I show off my big dick. Oftentimes, the woman will at least talk to me afterward and compliment me. Either way, it‚Äôs a fuck ton better than not getting any matches or endless read-not-replied messages. At the end of the day, most people use these shithole apps to feel hot. So women can post ass and boob shots for their profiles and I‚Äôm evil for showing off my long bulge? Fuck that.

Newsflash: it‚Äôs not a man problem but a desperation problem. I‚Äôve been sent unsolicited nudes and cyber-stalked by various women, and the common denominator was they were ugly as shit. Not just ugly, I mean UG-LEE. Like so ugly, they don‚Äôt even get attention on Tinder. They were dying for dick. The reality is desperate people do desperate things for attention. Women are no different than men. Studies have shown they are just as horny as men. They wanna feel hot too. There are just more desperate men as a result of guys being forced to go on the prowl while women can sit back and collect compliments/matches like Goddamn royalty. All women can do this too as long as they aren‚Äôt super ugly. Unlike men, where only the conventionally hot guys have this luxury. Plus, gender roles play a part as well (guys who have sex with a bunch of women are studs, women who have sex with a bunch of dudes are stigmatized as ‚Äúsluts‚Äù). Not to mention the VAST FUCKING MAJORITY of the time, men are the aggressor. They are expected to make the first move. Something women won‚Äôt comprehend as they essentially play the fucking waiting game. They will never experience the awkwardness of asking a woman out and not being sure if she‚Äôs attracted to you or not. Nor will she usually experience the soul-crushing fun of being rejected.

If gender roles were reversed, and women were forced to go on the prowl while even ugly men could sit back and collect matches all night, you‚Äôd have tons of non-hot women cyber-stalk and send unsolicited nudes for the dude‚Äôs attention. Especially since the guys would be focused on the superhot women. 

You‚Äôre telling me the okay/cute young woman with big boobs isn‚Äôt going to send unsolicited nudes to the hot guys ignoring her for the Instagram models? üòÇ No one is on those fucking apps to stare at an empty inbox.

This is just reality. People want attention and to feel hot. Deal with it."

In all honesty, I have found it quite easy to not send one of these unsolicited pictures.   Perhaps it is a generational thing.

557,GiraffesTV,"Cars 2 was good. There, I said it"
558,SkyOminous,"**Well, kids spend most of their day in school, and that was a nightmare for me:**

Started out year one as some kind of prodigy. I was known as the smart one.

Constant physical and psychological bullying from both teachers and students at school.

Constant bullying from both educators and other kids at the after-school place I went to because my parents worked till late.

Can't relate to other kids. Pretty much friendless.

The only ""panic attack"" I've had in my entire life was caused by a teacher verbally attacking me for something I didn't even do. After that day I remember feeling dumber and slower each morning (dunno exactly what happened).

I talked back to my teachers when they were being idiots. Sometimes got written up for bad behaviour.

""Obviously"" kids are always wrong and adults are always right...

Constantly grounded at home.

My parents don't believe that my teachers are the problem. Instead, I'm the one to blame.

Had no motivation to study.

My grades kept plummeting.

I fail and have to repeat a school year.

Even more grounded. Can't even cope with video games any more.

9th grade arrives.

Finally have good teachers, my grades go from failing at almost everything to having max grades in most subjects.

Enter 10th grade in a new school. I realize that I'm so socially impaired that I can't even make friends.

I was once again known as the smart kid. Until that point I had actually forgotten that I was considered ""smart"" in the past.

Got called an autist. Even though I was offended, it made me research a bit about autism and I find out it would explain my hardships when growing up.

To this day my parents dismiss my suspicions. *""You don't look like an autist""*. Who even knows at this point...

Got my first crush. A girl from another class.

Took almost a full year to gain courage to talk to her.

Obviously, she already has a boyfriend. At least I managed to get a temporary friend.

12th grade arrives. I was once again bullied by a teacher.

Gym teacher, lies to other teachers about me and purposefully fails my grade. Once again, the adult is always in the right.

The sweetheart of my English teacher was the only one who believed me. She's probably the most empathetic human I've ever met.

School's over anyway. I'm now ~~19~~ 18. Begin university.

As a repeat of 10th grade, I'm unable to make any significant friends. I'm no longer the smart and talented kid (though I disagree I ever was), and I'm actually one of the worst in class. No friends, no girlfriend. Every girl has a boyfriend anyway, it never even began.

And here I am today. I wouldn't go back for anything."
559,soilednapkin,You know
560,randall-politics,"Nope, I just believe in miracles."
561,randall-politics,"Galatians 5:22-23

""But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.""

You say you are seeing a lot of sin in your life.  Well it is good, you are recognizing sin as sin, that is the first step.  Do you believe God can change your heart and change lives?  And are you willing to let him?  We all have things to work through, but if we are willing to change and willing to have faith it may be granted by God's grace.

Many have been through it, it has been recorded over the last 2,000 years. All manner of vices has been cleansed from people's lives, including my own.  You are no less worthy than the rest of us."
562,TheSoftParade69,"I had them from 2005 to 2009, I remember those models fondly. Each year their would be a new gimmick, like a new gun or spinner thingy. I didin't have a ton of money but whenever I did me and my brother would go out and buy our own canister. Then we'd play with them in our room, making up storylines and arcs."
563,Budget_Shift,For me I never really got better. I sort of drifted from one drug to the next trying to feel happy and content but never being able to. Like I remember wanting to die when I was like 8-9 years old but my attention span was so short I never stayed on it for too long. Its been a constant problem throughout my life. I really doubt it will get better.

709,MutilatedPhallus,"I don‚Äôt cry per se, I‚Äôm past the point of crying. When I get upset I end up staring off into space with a blank look on my face, like my own version of the thousand yard stare. 

Back at home, I had a swing out in the back, where I would spend hours. I would often go out there to try to think about where I went wrong with my life, contemplate suicide, or just to spend some time isolated from the rest of the world. Sometimes I would go out there and sing about how much I hated my life. I would stay on that swing until the wee hours of the night almost every day. It was fun, but at the same time, a way to cope with my painful life. 

If I had a girlfriend, I might cry in front of her. I would hate to inconvenience her, but I have so much sadness bottled up in me from the past countless years, and no one to vent to."

718,Gesetzistgesetz,"Yes. A lot. Even more than men.

Cuddling has something special, resting your head in the chest if a woman, hearing her heartbeat, you feel beign the biggest and smallest man on earth, you feel weak, but nothing can hurt or bother you, nothing matters, the universe is meaningless, there only exists that precise moment, while it lasts."

745,,"Sex is part of a healthy romantic relationship. Emotional understanding and physical contact is important too, but I think if all you want to do is get hugged by a women then make friends with a female. It's not that hard. You know how easy it to be friendzoned by a girl? There is a cute girl where I work with who will hug and talk to ANYONE. She just won't fuck anyone who comes her way.

Now if that's what you TRULY want then the old just lift and shower bro thing will work. I however, suspect this is not the case. Interacting with women =/= attracting women. That's just the truth. If no one will even acknowledge you or listen to your problems, then it is something you are doing wrong.

This is coming from a socially awkward 24 year old college drop out KHV, so don't even start by Chading me. Yes, I lift. Yes women have made passes at me, but believe me that's not enough to get a relationship. The only time I've ever seen women literally throw themselves at men is if they are basically gigachad, which let's face it, he doesn't even care for the emotional support at that point. He just see women as another hole to stick his 10 inch penis in.

Edit: Minus the kissing and putting your face in her breasts thing. That's something only women who are into you will do, but that is kind of vaguely sexual anyway. Honestly, I've had strippers do that kind of shit. I even had a stripper once listen to my problems. You'll have to pay for it, but at this point what do you have to lose?"

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right, I think everyone can have preferences, but I actually... I mean, it's semantics, but I don't think having reasonable preferences is ""shallow"". 

A girl saying she wants a guy who can actually take care of himself and make a half-decent living.. I think that's reasonable. Demanding a guy who makes over $100,000 a year and saying they'd never settle for less (when that's like... What, 10% of the male population)? That's shallow.

A guy saying he wants a girl in half-decent shape who isn't morbidly obese is fine IMO. Saying that a girl who has the slightest amount of extra fat on their belly is ""a fat whale who I'd never even look at"", would of course, be extremely shallow.

I'm throwing out crazy and more limiting examples when it comes to percentages of population. But look at average height in the United States. Saying you demand a guy be over 6 feet tall, when that excludes 2/3 of the male population, based on a SINGLE TRAIT... That's shallow. Look, I get it, some guys get the short end of the stick. Being 5'3"" as a guy is sure as hell to be a tough life. But DEMANDING the top 33% over a single trait (and not a collection maybe of ideal traits) means you're probably putting WAAAAY too much weight on that single trait, which again, I think is shallow. 

Going back to the income vs weight thing.. Actually, just look at how the two are treated. ""Young successful women are having a tough time finding dateable men! They're all poor!!"" You know, instead of saying ""Wow, this is a societal problem and men are suddenly not doing very well, and how can we fix that"", the responde is ""Men are doing badly... It sucks that women need to put up with that."" And then on the fat acceptance thing, ""No, you go girl! Society should conform to you!""

So I think these examples really come full circle. And the fact is... I agree with you on why the Tess Holiday situation is the way it is. It's about nothing but trying to appeal to a specific demographic that's extremely loud, and a movement that's very ""trendy"" right now. But I think my biggest point is that if it were talking about men, it wouldn't be ALLOWED to be trendy. ""Suck it up"" kind of thing. ""You're fat, and that's just against women's preferences sweetheart. Maybe if you would not be fat, you'd do fine!""

The attitudes on the same issues are so radically different that it's actually kind of insulting to basic intelligence. But then we can go into deeper philosophical discussions on how women are ""more valuable"" than men since they have a relatively long gestation period, and a finite number of eggs to reproduce, which could be why society (and men) naturally coddle women more. And I'm not even saying ""OMG, THAT'S WRONG, WOMEN ARE TERRIBLE!!"" Mostly, I'm just pointing out the double standards, and not saying any of this out of any real hatred. More like ""hatred of the game, but not the players""."

I doubt I could relate to most anyway, so even on that level, it generally wouldn't work. Anyway..

Somehow, preferences for men have become prohibited. If you're a man, ""improve yourself"". If you're a woman, ""men should love you just the way you are!"" I'm exaggerating a bit, but you know what I mean.

That's the reason you see women from 4'11 to 5'11 with the same requirement for a man to be at least 6 feet tall. It's not that the short women are ""more shallow"" or ""overcompensating"" and the taller women are ""more fair"", their own height just isn't important - what's important is that the male is **taller than other males** - because men are status objects to women and if a status object isn't fancier than the status objects of others, it's worthless.

Saying ""taller is more attractive"" is different than saying ""height is a REQUIREMENT"".  I've had this discussion with incels who explicitly exclude black women on the basis of their race. In my mind if I was in a situation where I became less attractive than before, the first thing I would compromise would be unalterable physical traits that have no bearing on character.

I have noticed that at least men will acknowledge this, whereas women seem to be deathly allergic to being labeled as shallow. I respect people who at least own their true beliefs even if I dislike them for it."
921,Squez360,">like someone not thinking you're attractive isn't shallow to me. you can't force someone to think you're attractive 

Do you know about the fat acceptance movement? It was not to make you find bigger women attractive. This is a social movement seeking to change anti-fat bias in social attitudes by raising awareness about obstacles faced by fat persons for the general public. Right now, men are being judged for their height (and other bone structures), but unlike weight, height is genetic and not hazardous to our health like obesity. There is ***nothing*** a man can do if he is being discriminated against by women for his height. Some women have said men who are shorter than 6ft are a [waste](https://twitter.com/sonessasary/status/561251830634524672), [useless](https://twitter.com/NonnyUzo/status/447928329157357568), and should [kill themselves](https://twitter.com/shawna_philly/status/490617982834728961). The point to show women's shallowness isn't to force a chick to like you for being short. It's to raise awareness of society's ugly attitude towards men's looks."

Status objects. And not necessarily solely, however it becomes more apparent in respect to romantic association and attraction, for those women who place a great value on male height - whether that's every woman in the world or only a part of them is up for interpretation. Outside of sexuality women can certainly see short men as platonic friends for example.

943,weebmuttgymcel,"Facial attractiveness is not subjective. All attractive faces share certain features - defined jawline, forward growth, prominent zygos. 

You may think that there are lots of different kinds of attractive people, but that‚Äôs likely because you don‚Äôt even notice the unattractive males in your life. There are maybe ten ways to be attractive and there are a million ways to be ugly. 

It is the absolute definition of shallow to judge people based on their face. I see that this idea bothers you, because you are guilty of it. You are dismissing all of a persons accomplishments and their personality for a genetic marker that was determined at birth. How is that not shallow? Women literally don‚Äôt care what you‚Äôve done or how you behave. If you have an ugly face, you will never be dating material. If you have an attractive face, you will always be dating material. It doesn‚Äôt get any more superficial than that."

Relationships are often started for pragmatic, unromantic and unsexual reasons, more often in the past than in the modern age, and more often when women are past a certain era in their lives and opt for stability rather than excitement. The term ""beta bux"" is well understood in incel spheres. 

If you want to see evidence of height having decisive value for women, simply look at the tallest people on the earth, the [Dutch](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2015.0211). Or go to any dating site and look at the requirements women tend to list.

However, I personally feel that this article is specifically speaking purely on dominance and superiority in the form of two men in a power clash, rather than what the original post and comment seemed to claim of it being a high school bully.  This difference is what sets apart the claims of women being attracted to classic cliche bullies and women being attracted to physically and intellectually superior men."
1121,Chromium-Domium,"I fully agree with you that some women are attracted to those characteristics and that humans are animals and we can‚Äôt just ignore centuries and millennia of genetics and evolution.

1144,Blubber_Whaling,"Domestic abusers are definitively bullies, so females do like bullies. Females actively chose and most likely chose to have sex with a domestic abuser, they do bear responsibility with their choices. Females should use their personality detector on domestic abusers like they use on us incels. Do you really expect incels to just fly with that excuse when we are constantly told our personality is terrible?

50 Shades of Grey was a smash hit and not a box office bomb. That is hard evidence on what females actually like.

Incels do not owe females anything at all. Incels do not have to call females anything other than female or upvote them on reddit. It shows your clear lack of empathy thinking that incels should never say anything negative about females despite an incel's experience. Females have never loved incels and should not expect love from incels. Not loving and kissing the ass of females is not hate."

* Domestic abusers are bullies
* females have sex with domestic abusers
* As a result females like bullies

Females say they can detect ""muhsoginy"" and ""bad puhsonalities"" hence they reject incels but that goes out the window with domestic abuse. I have no sympathy at all as a result and there are plenty of men who are not abusive who are desperate but females reject them. A shy meek individual is very unlikely to be abusive. Females also spout bullshit about ""niceguys"" which they use as an excuse to fuck abusers. They made the choice, it is partly their fault.

All Reddit links are NP links, in which you can find: Women talking about touching guys, including 'constantly', as a 'completely mild' flirting technique, including with guys they barely know and guys whose mind they clearly didn't 'read perfectly' because they ended up rebuffing them. Men talking about the physical shit that women are always pulling off with dudes they find attractive, including the posters, even though they find it 'creepy' - yet the women can always keep doing it scots-free. Women describing guys touching their lower waist or backs briefly as an acceptable 'signal' ( I.E, no explicitly consent or previous sexual relationship necessary ), and an article about flirting from researchers which states the following:

>""But what works better than anything else? Touching. And research has isolated which types of touching are regarded as ""merely friendly,"" in the zone of ""plausible deniability,"" or ""going nuclear"" - Friendly: Shoulder push, shoulder tap, handshake Plausible Deniability: Touch around the shoulder or waist, touch on the forearm.

>""What about for men? Touching **is almost always acceptable for women, but can get men in hot water real fast.**

No way researcher-kun! Really? Maybe your next study should be about who's responsible for pushing blatant double standards ( Hint: It's not the homosexual demographic ) , but then you won't be able to publish it, will you? So to summarize, don't forget to keep all of this in mind whenever some woman attempts to justifies *any* kind of criticism or punishment simply because someone dared to touch her arm. It's the same deal with 'creepiness', 'objectification' and bluntness, which is what I started my collection about - Wanna know which 'creepy' acts exist that women *haven't* seen fit to pull on Chads and then brag all over SexPositive, TrollX, AskWomen, GoneWildStories, and StupidSlutsClub about? Literally none. 80% of women are doing whatever they deem 'inappropriate' or 'dehumanizing' or 'too desperate' to hot guys they don't know, have no rapport with, and never established consent with a thousand times over, and evidence is plentiful."
1246,Coping_Drawcel,upvote this blackpill
1247,KurtaKid,That is so bad because he looks like a normie tbh.
1248,,Imagine having a mental breakdown because somebody touched your shoulder. This dude is probably autistic and had no bad intentions when trying to talk to her and doesn‚Äôt deserve jail time tf is wrong with our world

1250,abundleofboomers,"I'm not even an incel, but this is so messed up. Poor kid, the UK is absolutely fucked. I remember seeing that article of a 6 year old being charged with sexual assault for hugging and kissing a female classmate. White men are absolutely under attack in today's society, and nobody gives a damn. I hope he gets the charges dropped."
1251,Bionicleforever12,Im just wondering. Why is a 17 yo in college?? Wtf
1252,DubsPackage,"That sucks but keep in mind this is the UK where people get imprisoned for any trivial offense.

Kid looks handsome but also a touch of asperger's, if he were NT he'd be Mr Chad himself."
1253,Green-Moon,He should have just run JBW
1254,timetorock19,"It does unfortunately depend on the girl and the specific situation

No such thing as a ""sure safe thing"" for all situations in our lives

I grabbed random girls' butts a few times in my life but I never had to suffer any negative legal consequences.  

But then again there were multiple times I was ridiculed, and/or yelled at, even if I did not put my hand on a girl at all

And I am an incel."
1255,captvic,Is this real? JFL society is finished
1256,,That is terrible. Meanwhile they let the invaders conduct their business as usual with no interference. That is one society that fucking hates White men. Maybe they have guilt over their conquests over the centuries.
1257,OutsideDream,"well it is terrible advice to try to put your arm round 17yo girl's waist, let's be honest here.  unless there is more to it then sentence does seem disproportionate on first reading.  But it's not unreasonable to be upset by stranger approaching you a second time and escalating like that."
1258,Kondijote,He's a mentalcel.
1259,Throwmeawayoffcliff,"I mean, maybe that's an overreaction, but I think it is good to just not touch someone without their explicit consent anyway, regardless of whether you will face any negative consequences over it or not. It just seems like the respectful thing to do, don't touch someone unless they tell you to. And there's various issues with guys being overly handsy with girls, in ways they'd rarely do with fellow guys"
1260,SabeFX,And this is exactly whats wrong with this world.
1261,69Vegana69,I mean if you touch someone in inappropriate places in a sexual way I'ven if it is intentional you should get some punishment for it I don't think he should get harsh punishment but some form of punishment is probably deserved
1262,LoonyPeace,Wow
1263,Newbhero,"I can't really say that this isn't bad, because it very much so is quite horrible. But if it's anything to him if he can get out of this, I'm sure this guy will have the sympathy of quite a large amount of people and hopefully it will help him to interact and socialize with new people.

Hopefully everything works out for him."
1264,Lellex69,Just imagine what would‚Äôve happened if the guy was attractive xD

1270,deep_muff_diver_,"He touched a girl's waist who he hardly knew. This is not ""making friends""."
1271,Gesetzistgesetz,"For one part, the UK has gone nuts with the laws regarding socialization, what he did was bad, but no for beign thrown to a court.

For the other, what do you expect from touching a stranger? There's no amount of inexperience that justifies it."
1272,DavidRP4K,"It‚Äôs his own fault, I don‚Äôt feel sorry for him. don‚Äôt touch people."
1273,Dokidokita,Why would a 19 year old adult want to be friends with a 17 year-old minor??
1274,,Dont cope. She could have lied but if you are so autistic that you touch someone you just met then you deserved to be jailed
1275,,Apparently he could receive a potential sentence as Amber guyger the convicted murderer lol. It's probably because he's a male. If a chick did this to a guy he probably wouldn't even bother telling it to a friend because it's so boring.
1276,,"It's the UK. Ours is not a nation of sensible laws. We nearly jailed a man over teaching his dog to do a Nazi salute as a joke. We jail hundreds of people every year for offensive tweets. We have police units who do nothing but browse social media looking for people causing offense, yet apparently not enough money to put police on the streets while London is in the middle of a stabbing and acid attack crisis."
1277,OblivionsMemories,I don't see how anyone could read this article and logically conclude that he deserved this.
1278,,"I guess they‚Äôre going off the basis that he touched a girl without her consent, claiming it‚Äôs sexual assault/harassment. Even though this contact wasn‚Äôt sexual in nature ü§°"

1280,seven_pillars_of_wut,"If anything, it's actually going to make it easier for her to get in: she can claim extenuating circumstances, which will make tutors and staff look upon her application with some sympathy.

1292,giantillusion,I just heard the other day about a 50 year old fucking a 20 year old girl but the autistic kid trying to make a friend is the problem right?
1293,giantillusion,I literally asked a classmate after hanging out with her for a few months if I could hug her because she was sad and she said yes. Then when I went in for the hug she moved away and was creeped out.
1294,,"Shockingly high, like 3x that of women at least."
1295,OutsideDream,"bollox my dear, if you read further rather than the Daily Fail in his own words he didn't talk to her.  This is NO WAY making the same move as a so-called alpha male.  Even alpha males don't do this.  This report gives his perspective as well as her's ... read his carefully and tell me honestly that you'd be entirely comfortable with a man doing this to you.  This isn't being in the wrong because he's romantically unsuccessful, it's being in the wrong because he put his arm round the waist of a complete stranger without speaking a word to her.  I do feel charge and sentence is excessive though.  But don't pretend it's a double standard!  It clearly isn't.

1298,,"He looks 100% incel.

Not a normie."
1299,Clbull,"Based on the mention of Oxford University in the article, I'm guessing this is a British kid. The British school system works differently to America's.

Nursery is Kindergarten and is a preschool environment.

Kids start primary school at around 4 years old, and this goes from Reception to Year 6, though sometimes schools are split between infants (R - Y3) and junior school (Y4 - Y6)

Years 7 to 11 are secondary school and go up to when someone is 16 years old. 

A Levels (AS and A2) are generally done in sixth form and go between 16 and 18 years old. When I was studying, this stage was not mandatory. Sixth form is often referred to as college in the UK while university is either called that or 'uni' for short.

A decade ago, the minimum age to legally leave school was raised to 17, meaning AS Levels are effectively mandatory."
1300,Milk-and-pickles,She could of been a high school student doing half of her day in college. Lots of hs now do that and kids graduate with an AA.
1301,OutsideDream,applying for a place
1302,,Thats true. Possibly if she was older she might have acted more maturely?
1303,DunSorbus,Hm? I was 17 when I started university
1304,,Especially unattractive men. If this happened to me I wouldn't think anything of it. If I was the girl I'd just laugh it off to be honest. Some people are just weird and who knows what goes through their heads. That's why I was never a people person and never will be.
1305,Kondijote,"BULLSHIT. White men are the most preferred by women in the dating market. The very same women who claim to hate white men on social media, actually have a sexual fetish for white men in real life. Check out the subreddit r/JustBeWhite to find out more about that. The real victims of hypergamy are South Asian and East Asian men."

1333,Fortcraft97,"It‚Äôs because he was already a legal adult and she was still a minor. But yeah on a morality level it‚Äôs fucked up. They are both very close in age and they shouldn‚Äôt have made it a big deal. But the girl over reacted and wanted to press charges. Now the poor kid will have to face jail time, have a criminal record, and be a registered sex offender. His life is literally fucking over. Finding a job will be impossible now. If he didn‚Äôt have autism and was a Chad this wouldn‚Äôt be happening. But yet sugar daddies who are 40, 50, 60, and sometimes even 70 are fucking 18-22 yr old girls who are old enough to be their daughters or granddaughters. I know they are technically legal adults but morality wise it‚Äôs fucked up and sick. They are basically pedophiles in the closet and they use the Excuse that they are ‚Äúlegal.‚Äù Poor kid though, I hope he at least have parents who care about him and will help him get out of this situation"

1341,SuitableStart,"No this is not contradictory.

White people hate their own kind.
Ethnic people admire white people."
1342,,I call bullshit bro. I'm white and haven't found other nationalities here any 'easier'. Most of them that rave about white men just want a green card or just to get out of their 3rd world shit hole country. If they have access to tinder they will of course go for the tall chads. Also most of the nationalities I've been with were white. Also Indian and Asians have a better chance sticking within their own race. I've seen many Asian couples and Indian couples.

1362,OutsideDream,in the context of whyayeman's comments it is.  He believes that it's an example of how romantically inexperienced people are stigmatized for doing the same thing that romantically experienced people do.  That's what i'm arguing against.  he's saying it would be ok if chad did it - i'm saying don't kid yourself it's not ok.  issue over whether men are treated more severely than women for the same offence is a worthwhile one and one i have time for.  but the case here isn't an example of double standards for experienced/inexperienced people
1363,,"Trust me, they‚Äôre not gonna care that he‚Äôs autistic (if he even is) because the system thrives off of targeting people like him"
1364,,"That's true too, you can't win as a sub5 man. Lol  Even the jocks get falsely accused in that environment. It's a danger zone like cherynobl."
1365,,I can relate to this at the hairdressers. A woman was touching me inappropriately but I just brushed it off. Was awkward getting a boner in a chair tho so I told her I just need a minute before getting up. Had a gay guy kiss me at a party and I'm not even gay and was with my girlfriend lol I just laughed it off. It's true though unattractive men are the most at risk. Women don't even have to worry about this nonsense and can freely just be themselves and act how they feel.

1367,Kondijote,"Many white SJWs are actually closeted racists. I have a German friend who's studying for a master's degree here in Chile. Even though she's left-leaning, she prefer her own kind when it comes to breeding. When I told her that her younger brother should come to Chile ‚Äúto meet a Chilean girlfriend‚Äù, she couldn't hide a slight face of disgust. Check out the YouTube channel of Saint Hamudi. He's a Syrian refugee who lives in Germany since 2011. No German woman has ever been sexually interested in him."
1368,Kondijote,"Dude! I'm a Chilean so I can assure you that women here in Latin America have a strong sexual preference for European men, particularly those with nordic appearance. Remember that the vast majority of male celebrities are white men, so they also benefit from perceived higher status. But, of course, if you're a very low-tier white men ‚Äìat the bottom of your race in terms of looks‚Äì you won't benefit from this."
1369,Kondijote,">I get bombarded with enough ugly looking ethnics holding hands with decent white girls

As Saint Hamudi says, they're outliers. And from what I've seen, white girls choose those who are most sexually dysmorphic: The taller ones, those with broader shoulders, etc. Some ethnics, such as Indians working in STEM, are betabuxers (which is the case of most men anyway)."

1380,I_CAPE_RUNTS,The video of him grasping the breasts of bras on hangers in the store And saying ‚Äúyou will never feel this‚Äù. is hilarious. Sadly it‚Äôs also true.
1381,,Why do European women stand with welcome signs for every ethnic that comes into their country?
1382,,I don't feel celebrated bro. Where are these women who worship white men? I'm missing out. Yes and being short does not help either way. When they talk about white men they talk about tall good looking Chads. But I'm sure they will even bang Arabs as long as they are hot and tall. Some white guys prefer Asians some black guys prefer Asians. It's a mixed bag bro.

1387,OutsideDream,"They should for behaving like that!  even if called out laughingly - 'a man doing what you just did would be reported!'  nothing will change if women are not called out for their double standards in the workplace.  even if all you achieve is to make them think for a second, that otherwise they would not have done"
1388,Kondijote,"Have you ever heard the concept of **VIRTUE SIGNALING**? That's exactly what those women are doing. Saint Hamudi talks about that [in this video starting from the minute 8:56](https://youtu.be/S4RynhpuX1k?t=536):

>White leftist women want refugees welcomed here and try to say ‚Äúwe love refugees‚Äù and ‚Äúwe love diversity‚Äù... But if it comes to fucking or to get pussy, they don't want the Abdul from Syria or the ugly African sandnigger. They want white people. That is the truth. Nobody want ethnics. 

I know he's right from personal experience. I'm a Chilean mestizo. Two years ago, I met a German girl one year younger than me who came to study for a master's degree in my city. She rented a room in my apartment for over a month. Although we became friends, she felt sexually repulsed by me. She ended up becoming friends with benefits with a Chilean man of **GERMAN-DESCENT** 10 years older than her. He's blonde, tall, broad-shouldered and muscular."
1389,Kondijote,"> Where are these women who worship white men? I'm missing out.

In Latin America and East Asia. You need to travel abroad.

> When they talk about white men they talk about tall good looking Chads.

Remember that the average height is shorter over here, so a man who's average in Europe and North America could be considered tall by Latin American and East Asian standards.

> But I'm sure they will even bang Arabs as long as they are hot and tall.

That's true. The heightpill beats the racepill. You're right in that being white is not enough. The advantage that white men have in the international dating market derives mainly from the fact that white men tend to be taller on average than other ethnic groups."
1390,,No we don't believe in that. Did you wonder why it made the news? Because it's wrong and shocking! Now explain to me how this equals those damned invaders screwing your precious children or that it's somehow in our religion to screw children. We actually do have laws on marriage and l am a Sunni Muslim not Shia.
1391,,You are going to ignore the part where it's banned meaning illegal huh? Well you spin it however you want. I heard you Jews fuck kids too. Look there's Epstein and everyone knows that doctrine means nothing. He was a Jew and fucked kids therefore you are a pedophile too.
1392,shadowcat211,"Of course it's silliness but this is the world we live in.  It's extreme but I've never gotten in trouble for not interacting with women.  At this point, there is no reason to fix what is not broken."
1393,,Yeah they will definitely fuck for a better quality of life. Bring them over to a first world country and once they have access to tinder then all the sudden you're not that hot. It all depends on what they can get where they are. Travelling abroad isn't my cup of tea and never will be. We get the same thing here in Australia . We get lots of backpackers from Irish and Swedish decent who clean up when they arrive. Lots of Australian girls here have a preference for Irish men now.
1394,,"Not so much the point about child marriage. My point is with the Brits-
who are throwing the book at this guy for touching an adult woman, let things like that slide because they don't want to look racist to that sect who does that. There were cases in the news of grown men taking advantage of very young girls in England, and the law turned a blind eye. They weren't Jewish or Christian either. 

It may be wrong and shocking to the western world but they seem to be fine with it. I'm sure it is not everyone, but they seem pretty proud of what they do."
1395,,"The man making this statement seems (maybe not) to be a religious representative of the community. It seems the government is the one prohibiting this terrible thing, but the core religion (or some crazy sickos) seems to be ok with it. 

As for Jews, yes, there is scripture condoning ""marriage"" with girls at very young ages (even younger than stated). I don't believe they consummate though until they are older, but the idea being the woman has no say in the marriage.
Obviously today no one does that.

Epstein is far from an example of the Jewish community, where merely touching a woman that isn't your wife comes with very major ramifications, if you believe."
1396,KahnSuperphone,"Non-white girls from 1st world countries such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong also have a strong preference for white men."
1397,,"I assume you mean a 17 year old minor that he touched against her will and physically assaulted her under the law. Of course you were there and heard all of the evidence from this ""grown woman"". You were also there for the cases of these very young girls? You saw the court permissible evidence and determined that the court did not want to look racist? You now know these child molesting pedophiles to know they seem proud? How exactly did they show you they were proud? I will assume for the sake of argument that you can link me these stories of these men looking smugly at the camera holding up signs of guilt and looking proud.  Otherwise you're another racist. Isn't that cute that it shouldn't be assault for a white kid, but damn those invaders you never met either. Totally not racist. Believe all women, but only if he isn't white! How does that work in your head?"
1398,,Our governments are based on Sharia law aka the Qur'an. Rape is not okay. It's punished by death. In Islam you can not force a woman to marry you or purchase a wife from her father or anyone else. That is rape and always had been. It was never allowed in Islam. You're spouting racist bullshit again.
1399,Budget_Shift,"They have a preference for white CHADS. Not white men. If I went to any of those countries I guarantee I wouldn't get a single girl. But, then again, why would i? A part of the reason we are in this mess is because people wont stay in their lane."
1400,,I don't see it here. And I live in a multicultural country. I see Asian couples that's it never mixed.
1401,,"There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that the UK does not pursue persecuting ""refugees"" in their country, especially if anything is religious based. Many EU countries make exceptions for child marriage. 

17 is actually totally legal in NYS. I don't make the laws, and I'm not saying what he did is 100%, but the punishment should fit the crime. 10years and a sex offender registry is probably a minimum punishment for rape, and people get much less even doing that.

 There was a case here where a teacher slept with a student (actually a lady teacher) and the whole case was if it happened a few days before he was 17 or after :lol:. If it was after the cops said it is waste of our time. I think it got thrown out because they could never determine the date."

1403,I_CAPE_RUNTS,"Yep  Now that everyone has a smartphone there will be no place left on earth to take advantage of statusmaxxing. The only places left are tribal villages, and some African areas. Chad will make his way into there. The only place left will be that island off the coast of India that kills missionaries if they try to go there. Imagine if an incel made it to that island. He would be seen as a god and would have his choice of the beautiful island women. Sure you‚Äôd have to learn their language. But you would live a life of enjoyment for the rest of your days with a woman who adores and loves you. Bliss. Utopia."
1404,,Legal age for consensual sex doesn't mean old enough to touch against her will. He did it twice and she ran away both times. He didn't speak. He only touched a strange girl and your defense is that she's old enough to fuck? He assaulted her the second time knowing she wanted nothing to do with him. She said he was smirking. It was also in a secluded area that he waited for her. That is not the same as oh they arrested him for touching her arm. Once again not being able to prove a crime doesn't justify another person doing it. Stop with bullshit excuses for bullshit behavior.

Because a guy asked for her phone number (or social media, whatever) she acted like her life was in danger?

GTFO with that shit. A guy thought you were attractive and was interested in going out with you. And you cry that YOUR LIFE WAS IN LITERAL DANGER?

STUPID FUCKING BS. Polite, gentle rejection is one thing, but this kind of reaction is WAY OVERBLOWN. 

A guy thinking a girl is cute and wanting her to go out with him on a date does not automatically equal him being a serial killer rapist or something.

For all I know, he was just a shy, troubled guy (based on her age I assume he was her age, so MAYBE 18?) just trying to work up the courage to ask someone he‚Äôs attracted to out, trying to break out of his shell, and your reaction is LITERALLY ‚ÄúI RAN FOR MY LIFE, I WAS SO SCARED!‚Äù

Absolutely illogical, what has the world come too???

I was a bit older than most of the students so I‚Äôd had social experience out in the real world and never had anyone anyone treat me so rudely.  If you‚Äôre still in your college years, just remember that most of the women in these universities are incredibly immature.  The type who do this aren‚Äôt very bright and seem to think they‚Äôre little princesses.  I assume you‚Äôre in the US?  It‚Äôs just a bad culture here.  The women in these universities have been puffed up by their bourgeois parents, have no experience outside of that bubble and think it‚Äôs okay to be rude to perfect strangers.  The girl who tried this with me first got up to use the restroom after I‚Äôd sat down to study.  I got up shortly after for some water and passed her on the way back.  She gave me the dirtiest look, but I simply smirked in return and gave her a little shoulder check to let her know her behavior had no effect on me.  I returned, sat down completely unperturbed and returned to my studies, completely ignoring her.  She got up in a huff and left shortly after.

You don‚Äôt have to let these people make you feel bad about yourself.  Don‚Äôt hate them, but let them know this sort of thing has no effect on you.  You‚Äôre at school to enrich your mind and improve your lot in life, and it‚Äôs completely unacceptable to be subjected to this sort of abuse.  That‚Äôs what it is.  You need to have some courage and assert your right to be present.  I think this is probably what a lot of women refer to when they mention ‚Äútoxic masculinity.‚Äù  For most men, if they don‚Äôt assert themselves, they open themselves up to this sort of behavior.  If you cultivate an air of completely not caring what anyone thinks of you, it helps a lot in dealing with these situations."

Given that you're on an incel subreddit, I think it is safe to assume you don't have money, connections or power to implement the large scale societal changes that you wish to implement. Your entire proposal is : ""lets just believe enough in our own values so hard that society starts adopting our values"".

You lack the self awareness to understand the blackpill and you fail to consider that the rest of society does not give a shit.

2. has the ""artist"" spent more than 5 minutes in any incel space? its a generally accepted axiom among incels that fatcel=volcel. this ""incels don't shower lmao"" idea also seems to be a pure projection coming from people with questionable hygienic habits themselves (=IncelTears) , and based on absolutely nothing. it's just another strawman attack to make the incel detractors feel good about themselves and like the world is a just place because incels are obviously so ridiculous they wear dirtied pedo anime tshirts outside."

The principal fault of the first half isn't that the arguer is a strawman. There are plenty of people, like me, who think this way because we are incapable of looking away from reality and lying to ourselves. No, the principal fault is that the argument is a strawman by omission. The problem isn't that women date up, but that what they define as ""up"" is based primarily on things men can't control (e.g., height, face, and dick size). Meanwhile, men tend to have less stringent standards on what they define as ""up"", so the average woman has a more vibrant sex life than the average man.

On the second panel of the first half, when I, and others like me, say it's ""disgusting"", I'm being sarcastic. That shit is actually life fuel for me. But I know that, subconsciously, the vast majority of humanity will think this way, so I'm just echoing their sentiments as part of the joke.

About the 3rd pic in my opinion it is a bit laughable how some girls get away with just being ""normal"" while guys / their boyfriends are clearly putting much more work into it but its not something I often think or care about.

Ive made some comics before and in a few of them I pointed out mental health problems. When they got posted on IncelTears, the reaction was always that the ITers said that the character in the comic who was depressed was also a misogynist fascist child rapist.

This kinda gives off the message that even if youre just identifying As an incel and you arent hateful at all, people will just accuse you of misogyny, rape, pedophilia, fascism, etc. So at this point whats the point in not being hateful, when you get the same treatment either way?

Also even if you exit the incel community, your life can still be ruined if someone finds your old account, even if you havent posted any hateful stuff. (A story like this was posted to IT once, OP was a woman proud of basically destroying his ex boyfriends life based on his old incel account, on wich he havent posted anything hateful)
So Whats the point in leaving than?


The whole attitude IncelTears has towards incels is exactly what traps incels in these spaces where only a very few not pick up the misogynistsic attitude.
And this is a huge problem, because you might say IncelTears isnt that big of a community, but millions of people get the definition of incel from inceltears, automatically making them think ""all incels""

This could be fixed by a stickied post on there addressing that not every incel is misogynistsic.

I know this uses a somewhat looser standard, but given that its been long established men tend to lie and say they have more sex than they do (while women lie the opposite way), I think a quarter is a pretty good estimate."

The average age of virginity loss in the US is 17. Given this statistic inherently leads to extremes in the old side (i.e. it is possible for that to happen at 22, or even 32, but nearly impossible at 12), the ""typical"" age would be slightly lower than 17.

I live in the UK, where despite the ""stiff"" stereotypes, university accommodation is a complete sexfest for non-incels, and most people enter at around 18.

1872,weirdshit777,"I don't think that's a good statistic. A person who hasn't had sex in the past year is not an incel. An incel is someone who has NEVER had sex and is unable to through normal means. And personally, I think if your below the age of like 24, I don't think you can truly know for sure whether you are an incel or not. You may have a good idea, but there's still a lot of hope being so young. (See below)

Here's a statistic I found- (This is in the US, btw)
https://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/how-many-people-die-virgins-never-have-sex.htm

""Between 12-14% of adults have never had sex between the ages of 20-24""

""Only 5% of people have never had sex between the ages of 25-29""

Notice the huge drop? 

""And around the age 44, only 0.3% report never having sex.""

Personally, I think 25% of all young men being incels is just you huge of a stretch, and just not realistic. BUT in some countries such as Japan, that may be the case. 

""By contrast, in 2010, 25 percent of unmarried Japanese men over the age of 30¬†reported being virgins.""

I'm sure teenage boys might be somewhere around the 25% mark, but I wouldn't call them incels."

And men who are sub 8 get left in the dust, even if you are tall like me. 

IT and lefties always say men care more about looks than women do but I find this untrue. This lady who used to visit a bar I frequent almost separated with her husband because he gained too much weight. This thot I am friends with on Facebook only wants guys with big cocks regardless of how nasty they are to her.

Why do they call us misogynists when they are the ones who proclaim women are a magical species that have transcended the bounds of human nature and all of a sudden no longer care about looks? They're the ones putting pussy on a pedestal, not us. Women are still human beings and humans are a very superficial species. Visit a major SoCal city like Los Angeles if you don't believe me how much big cock and six pack abs women chase after. I've been there. If you're not a male model material there you're fucked.

So if I made an average girls POF OKC account etc I bet you money I can set up 10 dates within 2 weeks. That's a lot of chances for a boyfriend especially if you are willing to have realistic or average standards.

I believe this is the well intended point gentlemen. That just because one is not a male nor ugly does not mean they cannot relate to mistreatment nor dating incompetency. 

I think the value in this is not to discredit the pain or agony of others nor to hold to it that whoever has suffered more egregiously is better than those who have suffered less. The lesson here is that we all suffer and only through shared understanding, empathy and compassion can we go on to recognize unhealthy symptoms occurring in our society and work united to solve them.

A partner is only potential if that person fulfills the first thing: making you horny.

Would you call volcel a man that doesn't get aroused by a MTF transexual full of body hair and with a penis?

Or someone is volcel if some disgusting woman wants to have sex with him?

If someone is intrested in you, and that person makes your hormones boil, and you choose not to be with that  person, you're choosing to be celibate.

You mean transgender. And yes, if a woman within reasonable standards (not drug addicted, relatively close to your age, mentally stable enough for a relationship, etc.) is attracted to you, you are not an incel. 

> But if no one of your ""options"" is able to even create some sexual desire, they're not even options.

You are dismissing romantic love. Say, if your wife had a disfiguring accident that made you no longer sexually attracted to her, would you divorce her? If no, you just proved my point. If yes, cool, you discredited yourself as being able to understand human relationships.

Inceldom always has been about lacking both physical AND mental intimacy. If you can have either, you are not an incel. And no, you can only buy sex from a prostitute, not intimacy. Google the definition."

So, if your only option is someone who is unable to attract you, you're not an incel because you ""only""have to be with someone who you don't like and wich physical intimacy makes you sick.

I don't see that as something reasonable and healty.

My partner has already created sexual attraction to me, that has been fulfilled, but if she transitioned I would left her inmediately, and I won't start a relationship with someone that doesn't make me desire her.

>Inceldom always has been about lacking both physical AND mental intimacy. If you can have either, you are not an incel. And no, you can only buy sex from a prostitute, not intimacy. Google the definition.

No, being an incel is not a healthy state. But there is no cure either, so you have to make the best of it.

> My partner has already created sexual attraction to me, that has been fulfilled, but if she transitioned I would left her inmediately, and I won't start a relationship with someone that doesn't make me desire her.

Wait, so you say you would never date a trans woman, no matter what she looked like, no matter how much your personalities fit? Thats is incredibly idiotic. Your dick doesn't have a built-in chromosome detector, you know?

> You can't have neither with someone that doesn't have any attractive for you. If someone who is, essentially, sexless at you eyes desire you, that doesn't make you a volcel, because you can't have any healty relationship, of any kind, with that person.

I have definitely developed a crush on a man before, even though I'm very heterosexual. But thats not a concept you would ever have to deal with I guess, you can just find someone for both things at the same time.

There could not possibly be anything wrong with women and their choices. Surely all women will be able to find the chad of their dreams and live in his harem, while average and unattractive men return from their jobs to empty homes and jerk to VR porn. Surely this will not have disastrous social implications for both men and women alike.

2440,giantillusion,"An incel is someone who, no matter how much work they put into themselves and how much effort they put into dating, is statistically extremely unlikely to find a partner.

Let's suppose you're a straight male. If you're average looking, around 1/5 women will find you physically attractive. That's usually enough for normal guys to have a few girlfriends in their life since they have a wide enough network of friends which allows them to talk to girls and build up confidence. When you meet a girl through a friend, that will give you more credit and it's more likely that she will judge you by your personality first, which will raise your chances a little bit. Let's say that 1/4 girls will be into you and you are acquainted with 5-20 girls.

An incel might be a guy who was always bullied or an outcast, for various reasons, which lead up to him having a small circle of friends, if he has one at all, most of which probably are male(cause same sex friendships usually have lower standards). That means he will be acquainted to no girls or, in very rare cases, a couple. If he's average looking, he has a  1/5 chance of a girl liking him for his looks, but we can assume he's not used to flirting, so he'll probably blow up the few chances he gets without realizing it.

That means that the only thing he can resort to is casual and online dating, which is already hard for an average guy, but for an ugly guy with not much flirting skills it's near impossible.

An average looking woman, on the other hand, will be considered reasonably attractive by, let's say, 4/5 guys. Even if a guy doesn't find a girl attractive, he might want to settle for it because most guys don't get many chances and being kind to a normal guy is usually enough for an average girl to bump her chances up. Moreover, girls have stronger friend circles and there's more collaboration among them, which means most average girls will have connections with 10-100 guys.

The closest a girl can get to being an incel is to have no friends and be unattractive. That still means 1/5 guys will probably be into her, which are the chances of an average guy. That means that, with casual and online dating, she has a pretty good chance of finding a match.

Now the real reasons girls say they're incels is A they are ""shy"" (they are cold and show disinterest whenever a guy talks to them) or B they can't get the guy they want (they won't even look for other options so if he rejects them, they're done) or C they want an attractive guy (usually in a high enough league that girls are already flocking to him). These reasons aren't mutually exclusive.

So you can see how women usually create the trouble for themselves.

TL;DR: ""incel"" women are usually doing better than average guys. That's why we consider them volcels"

You also don't really feel attraction the way men do. For us, we will probably be into most girls physically and, if they're nice to us, that's all we need. Women are more picky and very rarely can only use physical attraction as a standard (which in my opinion is often the case for girls being single).

These are all things incels have been talking about for a long time but people won't give us credit just because, well, just as we get bullied in our private lives, we get bullied online.

What most women fail to understand is that it's a hundred times more likely for Chad to be the violent guy and the abusive one, but I think they ignore it because they get so rarely aroused just by the looks of a guy that they can't handle it and it's like their brain becomes instinctive and the danger becomes fun (until they've been with him for long enough to realize how bad the situation is).

You don't just talk to guys who are attracted to you. First of all, at least give them a shot instead of trying to predict if they will like you or not. If they don't but you get along, actually make friends with them and get them to introduce you to their male friends. If your standards aren't Chad level you'll find someone after getting close to at least 10 guys 100%. Also give it time if you're actually unattractive.

>I talk to guys at Meetups. I talk to guys at conventions

Your hypotheticals are fun, but not founded in any actual evidence. If everybody had their own very specific preferences, something like attractiveness would not exist as a concept and the beauty industry wouldn't exist. Just look at how homogenic the ratings on subs like /r/Rateme are.

I recently lost my access to my old uni account, so finding studies to prove my point has become a little harder. The good, old, horribly overused [Tinder article](https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a) is pretty enlightening though.

Because the data is based on Tinder, it is mostly limited to visual attraction. The base result is that men swiped  right on far more women of all attractiveness levels. That clearly proves that men considered way more womens looks to be acceptable.

Because I have had this discussion a few times, I'll just disarm the usual counter arguments in advance to save everyone the time.

* ""Many men swipe right on everybody and then filter out afterwards."" While this is true, this doesn't disprove my point. This strategy only works for men if they would have liked the vast amount of women anyway, otherwise they wouldn't save much time at all.
* ""Maybe women just like every attractiveness level equally, leading to this distortion."" Interesting thought, but this would lead to a noticeable advantage for very unattractive men over very unattractive women, visible as an effect in the lower left corner. And there is no such thing on display.
* ""Tinder means nothing."" Yes, it does - especially when you want to talk about physical attractiveness. I would argue it gives even better data than actual studies, because the participants did not feel observed and under societal pressure.
* ""Tinder is just about hookups."" For pretty much everybody, the first step into a relationship is a hookup, so this is a very relevant metric. Funny enough, I recently saw a study that pointed out that something like 20% of asked couples met on Tinder or a similar app.
* ""Who cares about statistics, you only need to find one person that fits!"" Even conventionally attractive people have huge issues finding permanent partners. And the smaller the dating pool, the smaller the chance of meeting someone like this.

&#x200B;

So instead of telling everyone that they will definitely find someone if they just hang in for long enough (just world fallacy), you should accept that millions of people just won't. Thats not great, but you can't fix that. If you want to help, help them finding ways to live with it instead."
2493,le_ebin_trolecel,">what would you refer to as a hot chick

A 3rd degree burn victim that is obese, toothless, bald and never showers of course. Objective attractiveness has been done several times, and another poster even said you're aware of this which just proves you're arguing in bad faith here.

>maybe shes only hot in your eyes

Thats not objective though, thats subjective. You can delusionally believe the burn victim i described above is a beautiful person but you're deluded if you believe everyone else will agree.

>maybe she writes X in her diary

I have a hard time believing that there is a physical look that is indicative that someone is violent.  Good looking men with crappy characteristics are certainly traps for women (Ugh . . Ted Bundy . . Ugh).  The same could be said of good looking women.

2513,giantillusion,">Good looking men with crappy characteristics are certainly traps for women 

This is what I was talking about.

You can get a lot of evidence for that. The most basic for is when on r/tinder (I don't know what they're up to now and don't wanna check) there was the meme among Chads of starting the conversation with ""do you like being chocked?"". If an incel did that they would be reported or if a IT member found out they'd swat his house.

It's kinda sad but some I saw some people trying to start conversations with texts from r/creepypms or saying they're rapists and nazis while using a really handsome profile picture and tons of girls responded saying ""that's ok as long as the sex is good"".

You can also see that with fandoms of shitty celebrities or asshole tv characters or straight up murderers in jail, some girls get even more turned on at the idea that they are the special one who gets the best part of a dangerous man.

It's like women are using a different part of their brain when dealing with hot guys. Again NOT ALL WOMEN but generally speaking, hot guys always get away with more than ugly guys and that means they will have less inhibitions in good and bad ways.

I'm sure there's some study about it on r/blackpillscience, but I haven't visited that sub in a long time and it's late, so maybe I'll pull it up tomorrow.

Either way, I'm not just trying to claim that all Chads are evil, they just get away with more and many girls don't really care, specially in the beginning, so they might get stuck in an abusive relationship.

Incels on the other hand don't really want anything more from a girl than being hugged and being told ""I love you"""

Fun fact by the way, cis-men are usually forbidden from entering BDSM or swinger clubs when they don't bring at least one woman with them. Otherwise there would be more limp sausages than in my dads drying cabinet.

>It would be like a child-free person trying to comfort and infertile person who wants a baby. You know?

Yeah, I absolutely get that. But right now, you're telling the infertile person that you're sure that some miracle will happen. 

> But I can't just sit here and watch fellow humans who are in pain and just ignore them.

You sould like a genuinely good person, but you have to realize that you're not responsible for other peoples well being. Just like you can't fix homelessness, war or famines on your own. And thats okay. Noone, not even you yourself, should demand this from you.

If you want to be an uberbro tho, here is something you can do: when a friend of yours talks shit about us, just say something like ""meh, I talked to them, one or two don't seem like they are complete turdcakes""."
2521,le_ebin_trolecel,"Where did i say shes disloyal? I actually presumed loyalty on a landwhale but not for the stacy which is why i specified it. Not mentioning it leads to the obvious conclusion: a loyal landwhale > cucked by stacy. Stacies dont go for incels, you cant be loyal to someone you never associate with in daily life because of the disparity in looks."
2522,HowardAdderly,"Even when you ""ascend"" it ain't no bouquet of roses, you don't just find some chick, marry her and then your life is better. That's not how it works.

I don‚Äôt recall saying that, that was how it works. What it would do make us feel more human and less outcast. For myself it‚Äôs more about self hate than women. More about just being happy or even just okay with how i look

Or maybe they look like you and me and they don't obsess over it.

They aren‚Äôt balding alien looking framelets. I‚Äôm seriously not even exaggerating. Super flat mid face, large forehead, dramatic taper from top of the head to the chin (balloon head), and then a fucked up skull shape (like on top that is covered by hair but soon won‚Äôt be)

Not the ‚ÄúNormal situation‚Äù to be 23 HHKV (I know HHKV is a cringey term, just making it clear my experience is literally zero) who has never been in a date or successfully gotten a number. 

Right now I‚Äôm in a big three story house. Alone .

‚ÄúBig three story house‚Äù nice humble brag

My friday night comprised of shitposting, back to back episodes of ER (an old tv show, not Elliott Rodger) and eating a dinner of spaghetti and hamburgers.


Hilarious that this is the guy shitting on inkwels and telling them to kill themselves

2523,Bekiala,"I think you are making an accurate assessment.  I tend to think that it is  young women who are more vulnerable to the good looking assholes.  Not always but most people tend to get wiser with age. (Note I think this is true for the guys too)

> Incels on the other hand don't really want anything more from a girl than being hugged and being told ""I love you""

I would argue that incels are as diverse as most groups of people.  There are some spectacularly horrible ones and probably some spectacularly great ones (of course the later don't make the news . . .sigh)"

There you go, you nailed it.
It's about needing someone to validate you, that you're ok and worthy, so you can feel comfortable in your own skin.

But doesn't it pop out at you that that's a mental trap that goes on forever? Like...""I fucked a 6, why can't I fuck a 9, am I not worthy? Am I not good enough?""

Because you can scrape together 50 bucks and go get a blowjob, in other words, sex is on tap anytime you want it. But that's not good enough, it doesn't provide enough validation.

See in reality there's really no such thing as an incel, you can go beta bux and get a wife. But that doesn't provide the validation you want either.

So it's an ego problem, an endless desire to be validated.

See next paragraph.

> They aren‚Äôt balding alien looking framelets. I‚Äôm seriously not even >exaggerating.

Lookism itself is kind of like a mental disease.

I'm not saying you're not ugly, I'm saying I'm ugly too, the difference being I don't give a shit and you're obessessed with it.

Also I have a broader perspective on looks vs attractiveness. Looks is the raw material, an uncut diamond. Attractiveness is the setting, the cut, etc. So at least %60-%70 of that, we have control over it.

I can't do much about having the physique of an ogre. But I can put on a dark suit, slick back my hair and clean up well.

That's Looks vs Attractiveness.

> Not the ‚ÄúNormal situation‚Äù to be 23 HHKV (I know HHKV is a cringey >term, just making it clear my experience is literally zero) who has never >been in a date or successfully gotten a number. 

I think most 23 year olds are KHHV.

But again. $50 blowjob. You can go lose that v-card anytime you want.

> ‚ÄúBig three story house‚Äù nice humble brag

Well I put that there for a reason.

a. It's nice to have things to brag about
b. Life isn't just about getting pussy, it's also about living well in general, living the life
c. If you offer me a choice between fucking a 9.5 and getting $1000, I'll take the $1000, because $1000 buys alot of 9.5's, and 9.5's are mostly just fakeup anyway, beneath the thin venier of hollywood glamour, they're the same fugly alien as you or me, 2 pounds of baloney in a 1 pound dress.

Hollywood is fake, it's bullshit, this whole world is fake. Fake politics, fake beauty, fake money, fake security, fake countries, fake issues, fake religions, fake jobs producing fake value, fake freedom, fake democracy, you're living in the matrix buddy boy.

Men like you built civilization. From dirt. From nothing.

The hollywood 9.5 isn't the real value. You are. But you're too busy crying and moaning into your beer about being a framelet or whatever. You bought into this stupidity hook, line and sinker.

> Hilarious that this is the guy shitting on inkwels and telling them to kill > themselves 

Yep.

So next time you think normies must be having wild monkey sex on the roof, think back to the normie in the big house watching ER.

This is what normies do. This is normie life. Every day isn't a party.

%99 of the time, I'd rather be sitting alone watching old reruns. If some chick rang my doorbell, I would tell her to get off my lawn.

My father was like this too. He was king chad. But he was like ""fuck these bitches, they give me a headache,"" and he would go off into the woods with his best friend, they would catch fish and cook it over a fire. No women, no nothing, ahhhh peaceful life.

What I'm describing of course is a kind of mgtow thing. The mgtow ideal. Women are a nuisance. Self-important pests.

You wanna become a real man someday? Have 2-3 male buddies.

That's all you need in life for ""validation"" or anything else."
2532,giantillusion,"That's true, not all incels are good and not all Chads are bad. That never was what I was trying to argue. I personally had to deal with some disgusting incels and Chads in my life.

What people seem to ignore is that lonely men are a large part of the population and assuming that a big chunk of them is murderers and rapists makes statistically no sense, as the part of the population who has severe enough mental issues is really small and it includes both good and bad looking guys (the famous Elliot Rodgers was a handsome guy and didn't classify as an incel. He was just a maniac who hated women).

You asked for studies and here I deliver: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440510000154

http://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167214543879

Basically psychology points to the fact that aggressive men are considered more attractive and that attractive men get a pass for being aggressive. That includes things like bullying, pushing themselves onto a girl and being manipulative.

It's true, most women grow out of liking them as they get older, but you also have to realize that the good Chads are usually the ones with the highest standards and the first to be taken. So you're left with the bad Chads and the incels. Most women will go after bad Chads for most of their life, until they really need to settle and compromise by finding an ugly and uncharismatic man in a stable enough situation"
2533,giantillusion,Then there's nothing incorrect in what I said
2534,ForeverInvisible,"Congratulations cherry picking a few cases. Let me tell you something. For one woman out there having a ""shit life"" (whatever that means for them), there are hundreds of average to ugly guys out there with shittier lives."

""I have no argument: the post."" Also, jfl at pretending only women can be morbidly obese. What a dumb response, a 400lb guy is just as much a landwhale. 

>maybe i should refer to you as a dog

The phrase ""men are dogs"" is literally decades old and internationally known. I guess that means most people on the planet are, according to you,  fucking disgusting and lacking manners.

>makes you feel good?

I dont really care."
2536,HowardAdderly,"There you go, you nailed it. It's about needing someone to validate you, that you're ok and worthy, so you can feel comfortable in your own skin.

I meant it‚Äôs mostly about hating myself and how I look more than it is about women. Like being alone isn‚Äôt that big of a deal, it does kinda suck sometimes, but the bigger issue is I‚Äôm ashamed of how I look


But doesn't it pop out at you that that's a mental trap that goes on forever? Like...""I fucked a 6, why can't I fuck a 9, am I not worthy? Am I not good enough?""

Because you can scrape together 50 bucks and go get a blowjob, in other words, sex is on tap anytime you want it. But that's not good enough, it doesn't provide enough validation.


I don‚Äôt want sex. I want to like myself

Even if I did it would be the last straw before suicide because the admission of being such a loser.

Also I have a broader perspective on looks vs attractiveness. Looks is the raw material, an uncut diamond. Attractiveness is the setting, the cut, etc. So at least %60-%70 of that, we have control over it.

You can‚Äôt be fucking serious 

I can't do much about having the physique of an ogre. But I can put on a dark suit, slick back my hair and clean up well.

Ogre physique is substantially more attractive to women than tiny men who look like kids

That's Looks vs Attractiveness.

That‚Äôs you talking out of your ass and making whit up

No. I go to university and it certainly is not the norm. Heck it‚Äôs not the norm in high school either. 

But again. $50 blowjob. You can go lose that v-card anytime you want.

But I don‚Äôt want to have sex and I certainly don‚Äôt want to have it with someone who doesn‚Äôt like me. You‚Äôre paying someone to do something against their will

I love fishing but it doesn‚Äôt fix my issues so I don‚Äôt really get your point. Before my brother left for the army we hiked into the woods and camped for a week. It was nice but it doesn‚Äôt cure anything

2543,Saddam420,Very nice. Next month I am coming up on six years since my last hug so I'm not gonna lie this is pretty painful to read now. I had a horrific caffeine-induced panic attack in public last semester and nearby was a big group of business school undergrad kids. They came over to help when my legs wouldn't hold me up and I wound up coiled to the fire hydrant like a boa constrictor trying to soothe myself (and maybe open the thing to attempt a self-baptism?) and two of them were girls that both rubbed my back and it was helpful.

2550,H20cel,Congrats man! That‚Äôs awesome
2551,NeckMasseuse,"That's nice, but if youre very unattractive AND socially awkward, she was probably being nice.

It is nice, and comfort is good, but dont go dreaming up romantic fantasies.

In my experience, a lot of people (men or women) get a kick out of being generous, it doesnt mean they like you romantically or in a platonic since, even that they'd stand by you when things get tough.

Just wanted to taper your expectations, take care!"
2552,thenameofshame,"I don't want to artificially get your hopes up, because it IS possible that she is just one of those people who is unusually friendly and a rampant hugger, but to me as a woman, those are some pretty strong indicators of interest.  The only other reason I could think of is if you actually sit at her tables frequently and give her huge tips, although even in that case she could very well still be interested in you.

The fact that she essentially said that she missed you and that you smell good are the reasons why I think this, even more than the fact that she hugged you.  I don't know any woman who would act in that specific manner and NOT be somewhat interested.  Those were actions she did spontaneously without you asking for them and without you being sad and her pitying you or anything like that.

It might sound a little weird, but I also congratulate you for paying such close attention to her behavior and picking up on these signals.  My boyfriend had Asperger's, and he literally had his female roommate undressing in front of him trying to get his romantic interest because nothing else she was doing was working.  He was completely blind to these obvious cues, and it happened with a couple of other women too.  

I am quite familiar with the restaurant business in general, and it is pretty frequent for staff members to socialize after work by having a few drinks together at their bar.  One relatively low risk way to spend more time with her and gauge her interest would be to ask her if she'd like to have a drink when her shift is over (or coffee if it's a day shift).  If she agrees to get a drink together, that's a decent clue that she is interested.  If she says something like ""maybe"" or ""I'm really busy right now so..."" or something hesitant like that, then she is likely NOT interested."
2553,glassangelrose,That's awesome! Maybe try to hang out with her more? Do you guys have any common interests?

2559,alajameen,Here‚Äôs to more hugs my man 
2560,anxietycel_hopecel,"She told you that you smelled good. That's all the IOI you need, you're already in. In her mind she has accepted you as a potential mate but it won't last long. If you don't act soon it will be too late, she will lose interest in you if you don't have the confidence to go after what you want. Decide what you want to do with her then try and make it happen, smoothly.

It doesn't matter if you fuck it up and humiliate yourself, you need the experience of trying so that the next one will be easier. And if a girl is telling you that you smell good then there WILL be another girl that feels the same eventually (as long as you don't let yourself go)."

The goal isn‚Äôt to collect hugs, it‚Äôs for people to be comfortable enough around you to build a friendship and possibly a relationship.

2603,,"Maybe they were naturally odd or felt weird doing it...If so. ...then a hug is going to come across as odd

If it's natural for you...its natural for them....if its awkward for you...its awkward for them 

The goal is not to collect hugs...its to become comfortable and feel natural giving them out...which isn't possible if you are ashamed of hugging people....only way to get over a fear is to face it

I'm not gonna pretend that this would be an easy thing to get the hang of if some one is awkward. Like developing any new skill there is an initial cringe barrier to get over. Like it took me a while to get used to kiss on cheek as a greeting in south America...it wasn't normal by my culture....but when i returned home i would still sometimes cheek kiss greet strangers despite it not being a cultural norm 

And of course....use due diligence as to who to hug and when to hug and when not to...dont have to hug absolutely everyone . i didn't kiss absolutely everyone. Deoends on circumstance and social setting.

And last but not least....there are 2 ways to get to the truth... Experience or Theory. You can theorize what will or will not work or you can theorize based on other people's experience (which may or may not be fully competently executed ), but most reliable is testing stuff based on your own experience....and that requires a bit of trial and error and an initial sucky period....until you develop a natural ability.....and that assumes that experimenting is conducted competently and thoroughly and not just give up after a few failed attempts. "

I just thought that might be a risky move for some, especially because the incels I know irl are not very socially comfortable. 

Perhaps this is a result of the culture in my area. Who knows."
2606,Rammspieler,Then they must be running dark triad gene game.
2607,,"It's most likely a cultural thing...dont know where you are from but when i visited Canada...even hugs were received awkwardly by a lot of girls....i didn't care, i did it anyway because its part of who i am...its not my issue if someone finds it awkward...its their issue to deal with. 

It's definitely risky....and you never know who is or isn't going to feel awkward....and its definitely more difficult for socially uncomfortable people....i don't anticipate that many people will try this....but its a fact that emotional freedom cannot be found inside your comfort zone. ..infact everything your heart desires is outside of your comfort zone.  And we only achieve the life we want by pushing boundaries and risking embarrassment....and experiencing awkwardness "

2775,,IT won't screenshot this
2776,thepearmister,why are they so mean
2777,Liptusg,"Don't forget the fact that all of IncelTears charitable, socially gracious and stable members are also almost always subscribers, as can be seen in their profiles, to almost every subreddit imaginable in which they can smear, humiliate, attack and take glee in lording over virtually everyone they could get away with doing it to - /r/trashy, /r/IamVerySmart, /r/Badwomensanatomy, /r/Justneckbeardthing, /r/Drama, /r/AmITheAsshole, the list goes on.

Inceltears user, particularly their dainty female ones, for some reason always consistently spend 99% of their time on Reddit exclusively on venting out their sadism on other people and circling like vultures in large groups against any person they've been authorized to pounce on. 99% of their post history revolves around insults and 3rd-grade gossip, no joke. Then they turn around and try gaslighting incels about how 'toxic' it is to complain about stuff or harbor 'hatred' or how women can sense their 'shitty attitudes'. Doesn't work so well when you point out their posting history to them.

Also, as always, an honorable mention to incels being the top priority of getting 'hunted down' and driven to suicide in order to prevent rapes and abuse of women - even as 99.9% of rapes and abuse occur by women's beloved fraternity bros, 'Daddy Doms', and self-admitted terrible partner choices."
2778,BikerTheEnchilada,Seeing such creativity put into degrading human beings is distressing.
2779,icedankquote,"I think we, as the reasonable bunch have to remember that these people are nearly as psychopathic as the worst incels out there. Importantly, if we respond to this kind of harassment with hate instead of reasonable discussions with admins, it will lead to bans of incel communities, and thus it will be more acceptable to inflame the discussion.

We still need to force discussion on the issue of mental health in the context of expectations set upon everyone, without dismissing others for any reason."

I'll take the downvotes as a hint to fuck off, so you don't need to worry, this evil moderator from IncelTears will not be back.

Downvoting everything that faintly resembles ""the enemy"" or his arguments while completely ignoring what he actually says it utterly stupid, by who ever does it. I experienced this behavior mainly in IncelTears.

* I was downvoted to -40 for just stating that I always paid my taxes (countering the claim that incels do not pay their taxes)
* I was downvoted by an IT lady on every single answer of mine to her in a some 14 step dialogue. I could finally tell from the vote counter, if she had already read my most recent comment.

I concluded that this must be the way IT mercenaries are programmed.

Edit: Thanks for visiting IWH and making this offer of yours. I appreciate it and would gladly accept your offer for intervention if I hadn't given up reading IT long time ago. My own conclusion, they simply are not relevant, thus **I**gnore **T**hem."

I was more than interested in that, a bit over two years ago. Comment after comment getting downvoted to oblivion, then the userbase of your bullying circlejerk told me to ice myself while streaming it for entertainment. Afterwards, I got banned for ‚Äúbeing a jerk‚Äú (the people engaging in the aforementioned behavior are still free to post, however).

No offense, but you shouldn't virtue signal about the rift between the communities and how you want to fix it when your entire subreddit has been on the side of actively shutting down conversation.

I think it's fair to say that IT shines more light on Incel subs etc and shows people where to go (before braincels got banned, lots of members said they found their way there purely because of IT). 

So being that IT is causing more people to ""join inceldom"" (as you may put it) and shines a light on those places etc, will IncelTears ever shut down? If you truly cared about keeping potential ""would be incels"" away from there, surely you'd want to remove their #1 advertising source?"

Anyway, this is my last response here, I'm not welcome over here it seems, so I hope I have answered your question, and you are free to contact me in private if you wish. Anyone is, I will engage in any non-hateful discussion, but tend to block abuse, ain't nobody got time for that."

So when Incels are automatically downvoted on IncelTears, no matter what they say, that means they are not welcome there?

If I could screenshot the message somehow here I would.  Again, didn‚Äôt break any rules, wasn‚Äôt hostile or rude, and this is what happened.  

They claim moral high ground but truth is some of the posters there are just as offensive as the  some of the posters were on Braincels.  The difference is IT‚Äôs bullying and contempt for a large group of people is justified thanks to a few nutcases for which the entire group is stigmatized for"

+ You have a cute cat.

To people who have not had issues finding a relationship, or think ""being single is hard"" when they're only without a relationship for a couple of months, don't always understand what it's like for people who have been without relationships for *years*. People who don't have any friends or many friends and have trouble making friends or even talking to people.

I never got the girls I wanted in high school and there were always these pangs of resentment or feelings of being cheated by some universal laws of attraction I didn‚Äôt meet. I felt girls were attracted to dumb things, and I felt that it was their responsibility to change, not mine. I even spent sometime believing that, forwhatever reason, women just didn‚Äôt want me, and that I needed to learn that was ok. 

I see the pain in some incels, and I see the things they say and where their logic takes them, and I remember being at those crossroads before. Thankfully I kept choosing to be positive, and I kept working on myself, because if I went the other direction at those cross roads I could be some lonely, angry redpiller making the cringy posts that get screenshotted on IT. IMO, the incelosphere only spirals down, the longer you‚Äôre in it the less likely you‚Äôll ever ascend."

3005,DubsPackage,"Pretty blue pill actually, and unremarkable, applies to everything from employment to dating to hiring a plumber.

""Why did you hire me to fix your sink?""  
""Because you were there and I couldn't find anyone better.""

But if you're smart you take example from other aspects of life, ie your employer hires you because he couldn't find anyone better, but if you prove yourself you can become indispensible, same thing with relationships, she doesn't know your soul from the first moment she sees you, it can take years to really KNOW a person, so you're both kind of bullshitting each other with lovey dovey words that start off rather superficial and fake, but develop into something deeper and real over a long period of time.

That's why ""fake it til you make it"" applies to nearly every situation in life, nobody is born perfectly knowledgable, sometimes you have to shitshow your way thru while reassuring the client that you know what you're doing. Same with romance, same with anything.

The reason why women seem cold-hearted sometimes is that by nature they have an abundance of romantic opportunities, this makes them seem callous, heartless, eschewing the value of individual would-be partners because in their world, would-be partners are a dime-a-dozen. In a man's world, if you find a lover, you might not find another one for months, so each relationship seems alot more vital, more important. To us it seems unthinkable to say to a woman, ""fuck off, I don't love you anymore"" but for women it's pretty standard fare because they have another potential lover around every corner."

For starters, your mothers pregnancy was a year shy of being considered‚Äùhigh risk‚Äùmedically speaking, but even if she had you at 45 the only true risk would‚Äôve been to HER health as well as increased odds that her baby might have certain neurological defects or ‚ÄúDown‚Äôs syndrome‚Äù-all of which she would‚Äôve been tested for if pregnant after 1960‚Äôs.
So unless you do in fact have downs and that‚Äôs what u meant by blaming your looks on your mothers age rather than your unique, totally random & non age related genes/DNA passed down to you from BOTH your mother AND your fathers side of THEIR respective gene pools, you‚Äôre simply barking up the wrong genetic blame tree....and countless times looks(from attractive to average to unfortunate)are overlooked by women when the guy is genuinely confident in himself both with & without a woman-a man who doesn‚Äôt project desperation or insincerity"

**Lyrics**

***[Intro]***
Mhm, they're rotting my brain, love

These hoes are the same

*[Verse 1]*

I admit it, another ho got me finished

Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't

Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle

Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow

Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow

Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo

With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado

And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow

Who am I kiddin'?

All this jealousy and agony that I sit in

I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon

I just want real love, guess it's been a minute

Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in

Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it

Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'

Ran into the devil today, and she grinnin'


*[Pre-Chorus]*

Hey, these girls are insane, yeah (Uh)

*[Chorus]*

All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love

Think I need a change, before I go insane, love

All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love

Think I need a change, before I go insane, love


*[Verse 2]*

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes

To break my heart, oh no she didn't

Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow

Fuck givin', I'ma take not borrow

And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind

I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time

All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?

It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'


[Chorus]

Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love

Peace I can't attain, 'cause all these girls the same, love

Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love

Peace I can't attain, 'cause all these girls the same, love"

No kid's gonna murder people because he heard someone singing about it. He's more likely to treat bitches like shit though because his favorite rapper do that too.

And there's already an equivalent in rap music of the stuff you're talking about. It's the gangbanging, killing niggas shit. Everybody knows most of that is fake ass shit. But the misogyny displayed is quite real."

I can't believe people were actually sad over XXXTENTACION being shot when he was a total complete son of a bitch. He beat his pregnant GF within an inch of her life, was staunchly homophobic and had a history of assaulting his fans. The fact that there's trashy THOTs sad when he died shows that many of them don't care about misogyny, so long as it's not those ugly small dick inkwells doing it (it's wrong either way but you get the point)."

If I walked into my place of work and said ""I'm an incel!"" I highly doubt this would be the case.   


Most people are afraid of or hate incels. Most people are neutral or fine with gay people."
3186,Throwmeawayoffcliff,"Well idk what to say. I don't really do much of reading mainstream publications, media houses, and magazines. I'd think academic sources would be more reliable than other stuff anyway

As for Hollywood? I mean, looking to a capitalist thing, that exists first and foremost to gain profit, for politics isn't that great of an idea. This is in fact one of the big criticisms radical feminism has of more mainstream stuff, how capitalists will often stick a thin veneer of progressive rhetoric on stuff that ultimately isn't really that progressive at all, just to try and package something and increase its appeal and profitability. That doesn't mean that genuinely trying to be woke is bad, it just means Hollywood and capitalists in general aren't genuine about shit"
3187,Reformedgufestus,Rap is the single most misogynistic media I've ever consumed. Literally nothing is more misogynistic than rappers. Yet there's not a peep from mainstream media about it. When's BBC gonna make a documentary on it? When is CNN gonna have a prime time show about it? When will Vice and Buzzfeed and Vox have articles about it? They won't. Because they can only shit on non-mainstream people.
3188,MENTAINCEL,I guess alek minassian is a good song but it's not taken seriously lol
3189,inceltruther,"I'm not an incel I'm just here man. I'm a truther about incels, not an incel myself. Learn about the community and report back to npcs how their hatred of incels is ableist, racist, classist, and sexist. They either learn or their brains explode and both cases are fine"

3191,AmfStarBoy,And we were a legally and socially oppressed people for centuries and were often murdered. The last few years of legal progress doesn't really change that. LGBT oppression often was and still is extremely violent and trans people still have a life span in their mid-30's as a result.

3240,Madphilosopher3,"They presented a valid criticism of the incel community.

Help doesn‚Äôt just mean actually getting a girlfriend and having sex, it can also mean to help cope in a healthy and non-toxic way.

3244,NadaBeautiful,">  doesn‚Äôt just mean actually getting a girlfriend and having sex 

do you know what ""incel"" means, no? This is THE only problem at hand."
3245,Madphilosopher3,"Well if some people *are* truly hopeless in actually getting a girlfriend then the next best solution is to cope with that reality as healthily as possible and try to find happiness through other means. Romantic relationships and sex are far from necessary for happiness trust me. 

Also, you still haven‚Äôt addressed the criticism of the toxicity of the incel community. You‚Äôre not denying it, you‚Äôre avoiding it like it isn‚Äôt really an issue. I fully support the incel community don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I want it to be more helpful and less destructive to the thinking and behavioral patterns of its members. r/incelswithouthate is a big step in the right direction, but it still needs improvement tbh."
3246,NadaBeautiful,"Which is impossible, considering procriating is one of the most important parts of the human life.

You expect a place full of sad, depressed people to NOT be toxic? Stop being so out of touch, this is natural when you deal with a shitty situation, like the one we are."
3247,Madphilosopher3,">Which is impossible, considering procriating is one of the most important parts of the human life.

It‚Äôs not at all impossible. There are plenty of important things in life and hardly anyone gets to have everything they want. Being a parent can be accomplished via adoption and incels who are the least likely to ever get a girlfriend can still have loving relationships with friends and family. These relationships if cultivated enough can make up for the lack of romance and sex enough to find a level of happiness worth living for. Gratitude for what we do have is one of the best ways to feel better about what we don‚Äôt have. Life can be a lot worse than not having sexual or romantic relationships.

>You expect a place full of sad, depressed people to NOT be toxic? Stop being so out of touch, this is natural when you deal with a shitty situation, like the one we are.

There are plenty of support groups full of sad and depressed people which aren‚Äôt toxic. I get why it can devolve into that but that doesn‚Äôt mean it should stay that way. The community can and should improve to be a better influence on its members so that it can actually help them as much as possible rather than keeping them down with negativity."

Why do you think that?"
3379,Budget_Shift,"Yeah I mean I feel like I've talked about it a lot on here, the feeling of regret knowing you missed out on a lot of experiences when you were young. Knowing that guys actually want a specific girl to be with and will take the ones who are actually marriageable while abandoning the ones who aren't. Leaving the ones for us later in life as angry, emotionless and manipulative. I feel like once they go through college its too late. Ive seen too many girls get destroyed by it for several reasons. I partially blame the men for using them so much for sex and other selfish shit when in reality they don't want just that."
3380,Budget_Shift,"For two reasons, because people are, naturally, self self-serving. Obviously to different degrees, the ones who are less self serving aren't going to be around later in our life, they are going to be taken, probably since high school, and the ones that are left are the burned ones who either have a mental illness and cant feel empathy, or are so callous they don't have empathy. One of the two. The second reason is because psychopaths can read people like us, they can see that they can get a lot out of us since we have been alone for a really long time, our experiences are child like, and because of that they can take whatever they want and leave quickly. You got to keep in mind we are subhumans and for that reason won't be given mercy by the female, especially the manipulative psychopathic female population. 

Also I want to use this comment to respond to the raining fire of downvotes I received in the last comment. I thought this sub would be knowledgeable enough to understand that women follow strong men and traditionalism would fix a lot of our issues. The sexual revolution was a mistake. Most of what they do is created by strong men influential men. Why do you think they adapt and follow the rules of society so quickly? Why do you think they commonly do so well in school while boys try to go against shit all the time? Because biologically thats how they are. When you have a bunch of influential chad men whoring women out, when they have no interest in doing anything besides sex, it creates a domino effect. It starts to be seen as normal, while destroying women in the process. I could go on about this for a while but I am too tired to do so. Some day I'll write it all down but I know it will be wildly unpopular with anyone who isn't either christian or a fascist or religious in some degree."
3381,RockSoy,lol...
3382,Schroef,">	they are going to be taken

Right, I didn‚Äôt get from your original response you were talking about later age. Agreed, the older you get, the fewer ‚Äònormal‚Äô people will be single.

>	we are subhumans

This is a self fulfilling prophecy‚Äî if you think you‚Äôre subhuman, other people will sense it, and at the very least think you‚Äôre weird.

>	women follow strong men 

Yeah but ‚Äòstrong‚Äô is a VERY broad term, and different girls consider different things strong. Universally I would say ‚Äòbeing decisive and true to yourself‚Äô is considered strong, but that‚Äôs attainable for every guy. The rest is taste.

>	and traditionalism would fix a lot of our issues.

How so? You mean, women having less rights than men, women being taught to follow and obey men?

Yeah that would help you get laid. But it wouldn‚Äôt solve your bigger issues‚Äî you‚Äôd still be unhappy and frustrated. Also, the fact that this might help you with your unhappiness doesn‚Äôt make it right‚Äî because it isn‚Äôt right.

&#x200B;

You dont get what I mean. You are using strong as a synonym for attractive. What I mean by it is men who are the top dog in their social group, the alphas, the natural leaders, the smart physically fit guys who people listen to. The ones who create trends and push ideas that people follow. The ones women want and men want to be. Only like 10% of guys are like this, but they influence a lot of society through media and entertainment.

&#x200B;

\>How so? You mean, women having less rights than men, women being taught to follow and obey men?

&#x200B;

More like no sex before marriage, no polygamy, no hypergamy, none of that modern bullshit that completely ruins women and lies to them telling them to become sex toys to men while also making men empty and depressed because they know their lives have no meaning banging random broads.

&#x200B;

\>Yeah that would help you get laid. But it wouldn‚Äôt solve your bigger  issues‚Äî you‚Äôd still be unhappy and frustrated. Also, the fact that this  might help you with your unhappiness doesn‚Äôt make it right‚Äî because it  isn‚Äôt right.

&#x200B;

My goal isn't to get laid, its to get with a girl who isn't going to cheat on me, or seriously fuck me over because society has ground her down so much she no longer has emotion. I would love to have a family with acres of land out in the country somewhere but I know I won't get that because women today aren't made for that, they are built up to be worker/slaves for the government and the newest product and be sex toys to the top percent of men so they can feel loved for a short minute. They have been brainwashed to want that. Living just to buy shit and screw dudes who won't call you back isn't right either, but no one cares because apparently that is their ""right"" now. They made a choice to do it, even though in a different society they could be living better lives but hey, at least its their ""choice"". Its ruining our society at large, because we no longer have things like the nuclear family or communities that come with it, we have damaged people, regions where no one knows each other, and massive gender distrust(look how popular mgtow is getting, i know several people in my life who follow it. A lot of men are scared of women and a lot of women hate men because of what they have experienced and been told). This comes from this apparently modern and accepting society. Shits breaking down, people are checking out. 

\>Or am I misunderstanding what you meant?

&#x200B;

Completely, I debated even responding but I felt like it gave me a vehicle to rant for a bit. I doubt anyone will actually agree with me but it shows I am too far gone from the average person and is another reason why i cant get into a relationship."
3385,Schroef,"I‚Äôm not saying what you write isn‚Äôt true‚Äî those people you describe, men and women, do exist, but they‚Äôre a small minority from what I can tell.

>	 a girl who isn't going to cheat on me, or seriously fuck me over because society has ground her down so much she no longer has emotion.

Those kind of girls. They‚Äôre really the vast majority.

You think 10% of men are leaders, smart, fit. All right, agreed. What percentage of the population are incels, do you think? What percentage is left, and what do those guys do? Do they have girlfriends? What kind of girls are that?"
3386,Budget_Shift,">What percentage of the population are incels, do you think?

I would reason to say about the same amount, 10% in the other direction. I feel around 70% of men have trouble dating, as in they are sleeping around with random women because they are scared to settle down or have unchecked emotional issues that just blows relationships apart, or their relationship is on a thread and they know if it fails it will be years before they can find another partner because it was sheer luck they found their current one. Theres a spectrum of normal men though, the ones who are borderline incel are probably more likely to be in relationships because they have a ""debt"" in a way that has to be paid off with a lot of work, while the borderline high value males are sleeping around. 


I would consider myself to be in the borderline incel failed normie category, which sucks because I can't really get advice or help on it. I am rejected by normal people and incels alike while at the same time realizing although my chances are slightly higher than say a full blown incel, it doesn't matter in the age of the internet. If there wasn't so much competition I, along with many others here, could probably get into healthy relationships. It just seems for us to do that we have to find a girl who is apparently just bored and wants to quickly use us because she can stomach us enough to just do that. She knows she can get better because she can and because of that feels she deserves better. I would argue 40% of this sub falls into the same category as me. Their looks are somewhat normal but they have so many character flaws they get put in the same category as incels."

Sorry, find some simps to believe this lie you tell yourself. Hardworking, kind doctors and mit students are more likely to be virgins, compared to a [homeless druggie](https://youtu.be/bmav517MQJc).

And you contradict yourself in the next statement.


>However even very vulnerable women who are in dangerous relationships usually leave them in the end.

How does a lot of women who are well aware of red flags end up in abusive relationships. It doesn't matter whether they stay or not, abusive men are chosen and are rewarded with a lot of sex. That is all that matters.

If kindness and respecting women was appreciated in men then bullies and felons would die as virgins, lol they don't even make it to their 20s without fucking dozers of females.


>Then of course instead of recognising they need to change they either go after another vulnerable women or they do all they can to punish the woman who left.

Lmao, nice cope. If only ""vulnerable"" women lusted after kind but ugly short men. 



>Women have support to get out of these sort of relationships and compassion from other women.

Too bad that we keep supporting females who make shitty life choices. She should be forced to be in abusive relationship because she chose it. You really think women don't come across good guys everyday, but it just so happens she doesn't consider any one of them until she's too old for chads.

But it's all so convenient now, women get to have fun in a series of ""abusive"" relationships. Then finally make the correct choice in avoiding redflags when she's no longer attractive to chad. 

There are thousands of good guys in r/foreveralone and millions in real world who are forced to be virgins because they're ugly. There isn't a single bad guy anyone knows who's not getting sex."

I agree that Chad can get the best women, what I don't agree is with trying to trick unattractive men into giving away so much to get so little in return.

Sure it's easier to stand against bullies but not the ""freinds & family"" who harrasses your partner. They want a safer space. Nobody wants a toxic parents in law in their social circles.

Now, generally, in my experience, not a lot of women say that. When they do, however, it's because of the fact that they're bitter at their breakup, or whatever it may be. Not necessarily, the personality of said ex-partner.

What'd your sister say?"
3547,redramsfan123,"I'll admit you make a good point but I honestly just think it's strange that the girl would just automatically assume the guy would be a weak wimp that wouldn't defend her from his friends or family members just because he's super nice. He could have a backbone but a situation has never popped up where he needed to have a firm assertive hand on things. That's just one of the things you could never know until it actually happens.

I didn't mention the bad boy thing but I do agree to a certain extent with you. There are indeed alot of cases where the guy was nice at first and then became nasty eventually. But here's something most girls aren't willing to admit. There are also many cases where everyone and their grandma knows that the guy has a tendency to be a complete and total jerk and a player yet the girl dates him anyways because he turns her on. Then they get upset when the relationship goes sour. I have known many girls including my own family members who have been in relationships like this and when they take a honest look back they realize that they should have never been in that sort of relationship in the first place. 

The sad truth is that the so called ""spark"" is why many girls date bad boys and refuse to date the nice guy. The nice guy didn't light up the spark within her so it was easy for her to see the wimpy people pleasing red flag and act accordingly. She most likely did see signs that the bad boy was a douchebag by the way he talked, and acted and the reputation he has but since he lit up the ""spark"" within her she could easily ignore it and focus mostly on his good qualities. 

 This is why it's best for the guy to have the best qualities of the nice guy and the bad boy at the same time so he can be in a long term relationship and light the ""spark"" at the same time. The problem is, how does the nice guy do that without changing his personality, being manipulative, or jeopardizing his moral code? Unfortunately, he most likely can't. The only thing he can do is keep making friends, making money, looks maxing, skills maxing, and asking out girls and maybe just maybe he MIGHT get lucky and a girl MIGHT accept who he is and say yes eventually. Even then he might not make it past the 1st date but its better than nothing.

He could also skip the clown show and give up. This could end up with him being miserable and depressed later on in life that he didn't try hard enough to get a girlfriend and its too late now. Or he could feel like he dodged a bullet and be very grateful that he didn't waste his time trying to get something he could never have. This all depends on the guy."

Some refuse to date nice guys because of  miscommunications. They made bad assumptions. They think you manage to build relationships because you were spineless. That your social circle can easly out your girlfriend if she doesn't agree with them. Unfortunately most people are judgmental. That's why many people play a facade.

3600,braincelaccount,Hugging is above definitely as you feel the warmth of the other. Hand holding is just a step before that and we still haven‚Äôt experienced something as simple as this
3601,Pine131,"For me handholding is less than hugging. I know you guys mean it romantically but holding a girls hand is the easiest thing to get. You can just introduce yourself to a girl and shake her hand or going to the strip club is enough to get this. When you go get a private dance, the stripper grabs your hand and takes you to the VIP room."

3611,tonicKC,Yeah I kind of agree with you.
3612,tonicKC,True... I guess I was thinking of like holding it prolonged on a walk or something. I‚Äôve been hugged by female peers I‚Äôve found attractive but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever held hands in any romantic context.
3613,Oblivionka,It's just a lie.

Indeed yes. For antagonizing my cancer pain I need to take strong opiate meds which at times block my short time memory and apprehension. I remember having had a hard time to believe what I read in this post. Sorry if I misunderstood. And the foreign language didn't make it easier."
3618,Pine131,They hugged you? There might be hope for you. Women who I found attractive would never initiate a hug from me. The only way I can hug them is if I initiate an awkward hug with them and I bet like 25% of them time they probably find it uncomfortable.

3640,Jeremy-Meeks,"
Pretty much a similar story here. Virginity exchange with a femcel that lived a 6¬Ω hour drive away. Originally an online relationship, that eventually mutually ended cause of distance+living in different countries, and we stayed best friends (still talk everyday for hours, sometimes with visual ""benefits""). Even took her to prom about a year ago. Basically, when it happened, we just made a deal that unless we find partners that actually live in our area that we actually like more than eachother, we'll have to restructure our life plans to eventually live together.

And well, judging by the fact I'm still an ugly manlet who's still failing left and right with girls, I'm not finding anyone any time soon. Especially someone of quality. Still not doing well with girls. She's pretty unnattractive herself, and with Pretty bad social skills (especially with guys, due to going to an all girl's HS), and is always busy, so I guess the same, even though she has a lot more hope than me due to being a girl."

I agree, women are not entirely into looks if we are talking about dating though. Still you don't have to be 5'11 nor white to ascend. I know a lot of 5'6-5'7 dudes that made it, quite easily for some of them. For most of us we haven't ascended because we are held back by our brain's defense mechanism. Of course there are still some truecels but they are a very small minority and for incels it's mostly comes down to luck to ascend so idk"

They originally wanted to take my virginity and leave, but they liked my personality believe it or not so I'm still seeing them currently but we aren't dating, just FWB, and they plan to start taking testosterone and presenting as male so I won't be seeing them much longer but I'll still be their friend."

Doesn't change the fact that the overwhelming majority think this way and act on it if they're attractive enough. Women want Chad. Non-chads don't even register as men til they're desperate for someone to support their crotch goblins leftover from riding the carousel. 
I mean, shit, /r/femcels is right over there if you want more proof."

3961,Arthillidan,"Like I just stated, it's a figure of speech. I don't actually think 30% is a measly amount."
3962,Board_Gaming,">monogamy disappeared a couple of years ago as well

It didn't disappear. Monogamy is still alive and well."
3963,Arthillidan,"It's a figure of speech. It's like saying that if certain things had happened, the plague wouldn't have settled on a mere third of the population of Europe. There is nothing ""mere"" about a third of europe but in comparison to the hypothetical alternative it is.

This is just how language works."
3964,UrMomma4,"I haven't found that to be true.  I've had a ton of shitty women, but just as many shitty men.  

I know some wonderful empathetic women.  Nurturing women.  Women that just want good vibes and people to be happy.  Women that care for the downtrodden.  

This is classic you vs us mentality.  You ever wonder why both sides cry out that the other gender is shit?  How many radical feminists have you heard about proclaiming men are pigs and only want sex?  That men are violent and greedy?  How many men proclaim women are gold digging whores?  That women are superficial and judgmental.

You don't know any women that aren't shitty?  JW, that may be why you have the perception that you do.  I would recommend reading up on the bias  ""[The Availability Heuristic](https://www.verywellmind.com/availability-heuristic-2794824)"""
3965,desperateThrowaway89,"Going with the ""who hurt you?"" deflection? Pathetic. At least try to be original."
3966,luvidepenu,">Monogamy is still alive and well. 

Just because we have a large supply of crude oil now, does not mean that the supply of crude oil is alive and well.

Just because the GDP of a country is high, does not mean the economy of the country is alive and well.

There's a lot of boomers who are in monogamous relationships, but that does not mean monogamy is alive and well."
3967,KrasierFrane,"Nope, you're just heartless."
3968,mineben256,that isn't even how you use mere. just take the loss and admit you messed up or at least stop defending it.
3969,Vandalized_Love_Map_,"Nah, you can go read about the Halo effect. Then you'll see why we don't have ""enough data"""
3970,UrMomma4,"Ok, you're just a dick. You don't have pain from rejection. No, your misogyny is because women are awful. Is this what you want?

Maybe you're an incels because you have no chill. You can't even accept any type of niceness."
