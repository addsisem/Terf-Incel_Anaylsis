@jk\_rowling Thank you for saying this. WE LOVE YOU ‚ö°Ô∏è [twitter](https://twitter.com/rGenderCritical/status/1208084151573725184)"
1,DrinkingCoconut,RetlaOge,"Christ... the kind of shit people are replying you'd think she'd murdered an entire nursery of disabled kids or something.

It's twitter though, so no real surprise it's full of absolute clowns.

Apparently it's now *""cruel and primitive""* to understand that sex exists... Who the fuck are these people? How do they manage to function in the real world?"
2,ABeerAndCheer,MrMojoRiseman,"The replies to the tweet are just incredible. All she said was don't fire a woman for saying biological sex is a thing, and people are saying that trans kids wouldn't be allowed in Hogwarts and that Rowling is a literal Death Eater üòÇ"
3,sa7ira,GoshawkToday,"The fact that she put the hashtag #ThisIsNotADrill indicates she knows perfectly well what she is doing. ""This is Not a Drill"" is the title of an article, mentioned in another post in this sub, written by Kathleen Stock and subtitled ""I call upon UK academic philosophers and other academics to publicly demonstrate their disciplinary values."" Kathleen Stock is mentioned in Julie Bindel's recent article, ""Triumph of the Trans Lobbyists.""

I wonder if anyone else if putting up any #ThisIsNotADrill tweets."
4,Aslan_reed,ComplicatedSpirit,"Digg.com's article on the issue said that J.K. Rowling is wrong because ""trans people have a right to exist"". Jesus fuck. Any time some random person doesn't give them what they want, it gets blown into some massive human tragedy on par with the worst violations of the right to live.

NO ONE SAID TIP DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO EXIST. Fuck. Not buying into your ideology =/= believing you don't have the right to exist.

It's like having someone refuse to convert to your religion and claiming that they want you dead because of it."
5,maymoona,remquarqk,"I still can't believe a CHARITY WORKER was fired.

People in the biological, medical sciences say things like ""sex is immutable"" every single day.

If I wasn't on this sub I don't think I would understand the level of pushback a statement like this would cause."
6,aladyfleeingzombies,Taveing,"This is fantastic! This must be difficult for her as she'll undoubtedly attract a lot of venom from some of her own supporters. Like Dumbledore says: ""It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.‚Äù"
7,Sensirr,littlecandyapple,"As much as I love this, the replies are so bizarre. Guilt-tripping someone for acknowledging reality. I hope she doesn‚Äôt cave in and apologize to the TRA circlejerk."
8,halloweenaita1,quasarbar,"SEX IS REAL.

What the actual fuck is going on when you're ""violating human rights"" by stating an objective scientific fact?"
9,ShameSchool,Beepus_Maleepus,"Ok today is the day. I've fucking peaked. Reading through the comments to her tweet has well and truly stuck the knife in. All my life I have suffered because I am female. I don't ""feel"" any way in particular, I *am* female. And I have suffered for it. From being raped at 7 to being abused by my ex boyfriend and everything in between. Now we are being told these experiences are imaginary and to suggest that our experiences are because of our BIOLOGICAL SEX is fucking transphobic!  I just can't anymore. This is insane, I am done."
10,,freshpicked12,Now THAT is a brave and stunning woman.
11,,UnableGiraffe3,"I'm not surprised! She might be filthy rich now but once upon a time she was the kind of woman who spent time in women's shelters. I speak from experience when I say middle class privilege makes it easy to chant transwomen are women because it doesn't even occur to ask questions like ""what if I was at a homeless shelter and my roommate was the Gamestop Ma'am? What if I were in prison and had to share a shower with Kate White?"""
12,,femaleisnotafeeling,"People are losing their damn minds in the replies. They love posting that photo of Emma Watson wearing the ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äùshirt, as if JKR is advocating for the hunt of trans people for sport."
13,,vageennpeenrgender,"I‚Äôm shook right now. I feel like I will never have the professional and personal security to be so bold.
Seeing JK be brave enough to STAND UP is amazing to me. HP was a big part of my childhood and family life."
14,,ThrowThrowBurritoABC,A few months ago several of my acquaintances went to local libraries and hid Rowling's books so patrons couldn't find them.   At least two refused to let their children read Harry Potter because they consider her a TERF.
15,,Calamity_loves_tacos,"So surprising (/s) how such a sound, non aggressive statement is met with loads of memes saying ""shut the fuck up terf"" with cutesy guns being pointed from the side shouting about being on ""the right side of history""."
16,,restlessyears,"Oh thank goodness. Well done JK. We need someone with her profile to stand up for women.

The replies and indirects about her tweet is absolutely INSANE.... all this whining and crying about ‚Äúhow will the trans kids feel seeing this‚Äù and all this... what?? Nobody should be so fragile and deluded that they cry at the MATERIAL REALITY that biological sex is a real thing. Like other commenters have said, people are making it seem as if she is some sort of mass murderer for acknowledging a basic fact that EVERYONE ACCEPTED up until recently."
17,,flapyourwings,"Oh damn, JK went IN!"
18,,sara7147,YES!!!  So glad a celebrity had the balls to stand up and SAY SOMETHING!!!
19,,cavesofsponge,"Thank you, J.K."
20,,modernmedusaa,"FANTASTIC NEWS!!

And this is why I love when poor women end up super rich but don't forget about their sisters- she is still in touch with her struggles as a single mother and the other underdogs thrown under the bus

Also writing fantasy novels for a living she probs has a lot to say about that LOLLLL

Glad JK was able to see the growing gravitas of this issue. This is actually huge given her level of fame!! Seems like she was flirting with it in the background but has now decided to go full throttle GC!!!"
21,,raddy-set-go,"I find it deeply disturbing that merely saying ""sex  is real"" is now front page news. I genuinely feel like I'm going crazy reading the responding tweets, like I've stepped into a parallel universe."
22,,accioupvotes,Oof. According to some of the comments this post is rising in /r/all. Prepare for the TRAs
23,,Saitschik,The comments under her tweet are a living proof that many transgenderpeople unfortunately have severe mental health issue. The way they are losing it is more than creepy and the way they threaten women for their agenda disgusting. Everybody supporting them supports a new form of misogyny. Plain and simple.
24,,sojourner_truth_,Yes!!!! I love to hear celebrities pushing back.
25,,2or3thingsIknow,The idiot trans loons who trashed her from a Like on a tweet caused their own issues. The more they screech and whine and ban and censor the more people push back. Of course she was going to be a terf. This is what happens when you are metaphorically and literally bullied by men. You push back.
26,,FlyinBananaPhone,The man who started all this with Maya referred to a feminist charity group as ‚Äúroasties‚Äù and said he hoped they got raped. Incel language.
27,,BasieSkanks,"Rowling didn‚Äôt even mention gender ideology, and the TRAs are losing their shit.  She only mentioned that biological sex is real. How can ANYONE with a functioning brain stem argue with that? The fact they are frothing at the mouth at a statement of objective true just shows how crazy this movement has become."
28,,mokebe_asfalit,Is woke twitter going to start comparing her to Voldemort now?
29,,Jo_in_TN,"This court ruling has emboldened cyclopath.  He is talking lawsuits and is wanting to contact major news publications.

He really thinks he can sue every woman into shutting up, but will more likely begin a campaign of contacting employers of every woman who speaks out.   I have nothing to lose to this bully, but I fear for women in the U.K.

I can read his twitter account from my phone only (which I find difficult), since I'm been blocked on my computer.  :)"
30,,antediluvian5,"Came to this sub to see if anyone was talking about this! I saw ‚ÄúJK Rowling is a terf‚Äù trending and thought, ‚ÄúGood for her. I like her more now.‚Äù"
31,,RealMapelFlavour,"""Cool."" - Magdalen Berns"
32,,furious_doog,Watch them burn their Harry Potter books.
33,,moglbu,The replies to her tweet are all people claiming to be in tears and heartbroken. I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine being that affected by someone‚Äôs words.
34,,shapesofthesea,"I read the tweet and my first thought was, she‚Äôs not saying anything wrong. She‚Äôs acknowledging reality. The people angry about her comment are so deep in denial. I don‚Äôt get it."
35,,,[deleted]
36,,Jenjenhar,"So wonderful that JK is brave enough to stand up for common sense and women‚Äôs rights. A large number of her fans are crying about it. Looks like they still believe in fantasies.

Maya F is crowdfunding her legal fees. Unfortunately she has only hit ¬£85,000 so far. It‚Äôs against rules to link it but please please donate if you are able to."
37,,apfrun,"I cannot believe saying ""sex is real"" is such a massive issue. Also how is it even transphobic whatsoever? Even trans people fucking know they have a biological sex. This is all so ridiculous lol."
38,,,[deleted]
39,,BanksyGuy00018,"Just some minutes later you'll see hundreds of raging lib HP fans dissowning JK and talking trash about their fav franchise.
Maybe now they'll read another book"
40,,Ergative_Absolutive,Goddess bless her.
41,,yesisaiditxx,"I‚Äôm so amazed. I wish she‚Äôd know that despite all of the people who throw this to the erroneous extreme of, ‚ÄúShe hates trans people‚Äù and attack her accordingly, there are women out there like me who read that from such a distinguished person and felt that they could breathe a little more easily. I had really believed that no person of her caliber would ever do this‚Äî hell, I had even doubted that any were out there who didn‚Äôt buy in to the fantasy. Anyone who accuses her of hateful bigotry is living in their fragile imagination. She‚Äôs not calling for trans abuse in any way. She is simply speaking up for what she knows as true regarding justice and reality.

People often tell the story of how she started Harry Potter, and I see that same determined woman in this tweet. Congratulations to J.K Rowling for living with integrity."
42,,gencritgenz,the like ratio is also really encouraging! way more likes than any of her recent tweets!!
43,,,Women continue to suffer while men don't. This is not fair and it is not right.
44,,knight_siegmeyer,"BEAUTIFUL. Thank you JK! I've always felt a little honoured to have a signed copy of The Goblet of Fire from her but now it's extra special ngl.

I take back everything I said about the Crimes of Grindlewald being kinda bad. (But not the Cursed Child. I stand by my review of 'pretty show, not nearly as good as the actual books')"
45,,EquivalentApple,"Holy shit I hope JK Tweets about the Scottish GRA reform consultation. The fucking bastards have been trying to sneak it in below the radar like they always do. Coincidentally Wings over Scotland, the biggest Scottish GC Twitter account and the one with the widest reach, got banned the day they announced the consultation."
46,,Tonglentoo,Just got called a terf today over in Twitter for applauding her. üòè
47,,stompbixby,"maybe shes sick of literal hundreds of creeps arguing about 'girldick' in every fucking tweet she makes

it would bother me less if there werent actual tweets from children sandwiched between these fucking girldick tweets

god bless you jkr"
48,,,"The only negative consequence of this are the liberal think pieces that are going to flood youtube on why JK Rowling is cancelled and how ‚Äúwrong‚Äù she is. üòÇ

_All_ the people I follow who usually stick to pop culture and avoid politics, are going to have something to say about this. I‚Äôm tired already."
49,,spoopypigeon,finally
50,,Felix_Dzerjinsky,Holy shit TRA heads will explode.
51,,Fitncurly,I think I‚Äôll go out and buy the entire Harry Potter set just for this üòÜ.  Yessss!
52,,black_it_out,Hurrah!! I was so miserable this morning - the court ruling was outrageous. I now feel galvanised. Speaking out always makes a difference.
53,,sparklesailor,"She‚Äôs in a unique position in that she‚Äôs made her fortune and success and is no longer reliant on public opinion. We all know she‚Äôs had these opinions for a while but I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs finally being open and bold about it. The TRAs can cry and complain if they want, and call for a boycott of one of the world‚Äôs biggest and most beloved franchises, and it won‚Äôt make the slightest bit of difference."
54,,vitisrotundifolia,"If you listen closely, you can hear thousands peaking at once"
55,,Deleteordecay,"Really appreciate when influential people, especially women stand up to this bullshit. Maybe she can have a word with Emma Watson.

The replies are both sad and comical at the same time.

Edit: remember the outrage over a tweet she liked? She knew she was gonna catch hate for this but did it anyway. Good for her."
56,,,[deleted]
57,,maiarooberts,"Shout out to JK Rowling for taking a stand because this shit has been getting ridiculous. They're engaged and it's currently trending on Twitter. They even have ""JK Rowling is a TERF"" trending. LOL"
58,,Sasasamker,"Such a big deal. I have been trying to battle commenters on that post by explaining what the T-word means, who uses it, why the case was important, why it was so disappointing, why it's outrageous she lost her job, how sex cant change.

The basics really. Same as in real life, gently gently explaining to people why this is harmful to women.

If you arent already, would any of you mind joining in on Twitter and helping us look as reasonable as we are? The TRA's are out in force. Unfortunately for them, they've come out with the gun memes and manga characters and look, frankly, ridiculous."
59,,purrfekt,T\*RF is trending now on Twitter üôÑ
60,,whitelilyflower,"Good for her. The replies to her tweet are so pathetic, I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre at a point in time where stating basic facts about biology can get you crucified. Ridiculous."
61,,Lonely_Cartographer,She said how I feel exactly! I don't care if men want to dress like women or even call them women as long as they are not legally recognized as women and i don't get thrown in jail for calling them a man
62,,Aunpasoportucasa,Why is it wrong to understand there is a biological sex? People are completely overreacting. I see a lot of Harry Potter tattoo coverups in the near future.
63,,quack-snack,The number of people apparently reduced to a puddle of tears over this - a statement of biological fact and reality - makes me laugh.
64,,ShootTheMoon03,"Apparently Mark Hamill liked the tweet. I suspect a lot more prominent figures share the same views but don‚Äôt want to deal with the Twitter circus and ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù. Twitter really thinks they are the majority opinion because they start trending topics and try to cancel everyone when it‚Äôs really propelled by teenagers and college age kids trying to be woke and regurgitating they same mantras, such as‚Äùtranswomen are women‚Äù, without a clue of what they‚Äôre talking about . They can‚Äôt even define woman without circular logic or sexist stereotypes"
65,,Far-Air,She is wonderful and knows actual kindness‚Äî not TRA-‚Äòkindness‚Äô threatened into her. We need more people like her standing up for women.
66,,ATWTFRK,This is almost too good to be true!
67,,Sasofa,"They're gonna try and cancel her in every way possible.

Too bad cancel culture doesn't exist. I can think of very few people who have been ""cancelled"" on Twitter and had anly longterm negative impact on their career. All she has to do is not address it."
68,,FrenchieFrankenstein,I‚Äôm so glad
69,,lefromageetlesvers,"Never read the Harry Potter books, because i was too old when they came out, but i'm all in. I'm teaching philosophy, so maybe i can work her into on my syllabus. Great news!"
70,,purrfekt,"Well! Excuse me, while I cheer (silently at work)! üòç

I'll remember this, when the famous skeptic dudebros come along and appropriate the resistance against TRA. The cowards."
71,,SadMadNomad,"Good for her. I know she's super rich and all, but it takes guts nowadays to speak common sense. She didn't say anything particularly controversial, yet we all know how simply acknowledging biological sex as a reality is considered ""transphobic.""

I enjoyed the Harry Potter books when I was a kid, but I never stuck around too long in the fandom. Every big fandom has its overzealous fans; the petty side of me wonders how libfem HP fans will handle this. Judging by the responses on Twitter, I'm sure they'll be oh so calm and open-minded, unlike evil transphobic JK Rowling...

Seriously though, I can't believe we live in a world where ""sex is real"" needs to be said and is considered offensive. I'm glad someone greatly influential like JK Rowling is speaking out.

Edit: I looked up more responses on Twitter and Tumblr, and I can't feel a smidgen of gleeful pettiness like I thought I could. The viciousness and heartbreak many people are showing is exhausting. Rowling said nothing hateful or prejudiced, yet people are treating her as if she's a supervillain on the levels of Voldemort."
72,,spin_the_globe,"Good for her. Never been a Harry Potter fan, but that may have to change."
73,,tr330fsn4rk,"Some idols never let you down..

This is absolutely wonderful! And she was so classy about it, too."
74,,rezkidsinlove,"Where's that David Tennant 10th Doctor 'GOOD OL' J.K.!!!!!!' gif????

(Also, presumably, The Tenth Doctor knew about all this, considering he's a Time Lord and all. The Doctor is a TERF, confirmed.)

I think I might wear my Gryffindor scarf today in solidarity."
75,,jadedjude,"I hope she stands her fucking ground.

One look at the replies and I wanna gag, I hate these people so fucking much. I'm not a rad fem so I find it ironic they call anyone a terf simply because we hate their bullshit.

I doubt JK is even a TERF, she's just peak trans and I'm glad she had the balls to speak her mind.

\#IStandwithJKR"
76,,Lesbian_Frylock,Finally. Saw this coming from all of her rabid genderkweer fans annoying her constantly. She was gonna crack eventually.
77,,why_cambrio,"Pleasantly surprised at the amount of support in the comments, even if it is intermittently placed in between memes that are LITERALLY calls to violence against ""t\*rfs"""
78,,raddy-set-go,"I've liked her tweet. That doesn't seem at all like a big deal but I'm becoming less afraid. Especially considering women (and some men like @glinner but let's face it mostly women) are actually paying with their livelihoods for stating the truth. It's the least I can do.

Edit: a number of people I know and follow have called J.K. Rowling an ""evil terf"" or something to that effect, saying they stand by ""those she has hurt with her transphobia""... And these are otherwise intelligent seeming people. I've not uttered a word of my own on the matter but I can't help feeling like I need to brace myself for some backlash soon."
79,,medusahisshiss,"I picture her reading the responses, laughing, surrounded by piles of money. I love it."
80,,trw365,"I feel so sorry for Maya that she is having to go through all of this, from her writing she seems to have a very clever and smart point of view about international tax policy, its a pity she isn't still in the job she loved but at the same time I am enjoying the sun shining through the overton window now that people are now discussing how batshit this all is."
81,,Shotgunshine__,"I‚Äôve been a Harry Potter fan since I was 8, and I thought that I couldn‚Äôt love her more. She has officially proven me wrong! I‚Äôm so glad that she‚Äôs using her massive platform to say what the rest of us are thinking."
82,,LeishaCamden,I was SO HAPPY when I saw this on Twitter earlier today. This is a big deal.
83,,DownWithPorn,Well done Rowling! Looks like my country is leading the way in resisting this trans bullshit.
84,,antikvariaatti,I'm proud of her.
85,,brownclown96,Yes!!! Queen Rowling. It is so valuable to have people in her position who cannot be silenced by firing or intimidation to speak out on behalf of women. I‚Äôm so happy she‚Äôs done this
86,,hobbittoisengard,Things like these shows the true qualities of the trans movement. Ignorance and rudeness.
87,,vierkeervijf,Well done Joanne! The TRAs are going crazy and showing their true nature to an even wider audience now!
88,,arnaq,Fuck yes! Ily JK Rowling! Come visit us at this sub :)
89,,NoctaeBride,What a fucking queen. Unironically.
90,,InASeaOfReality,My favorite part is the trans activists comparing her to characters from her own book
91,,PollyannaPenny,"I'm so glad she finally came out of the Gender Critical closet officially. We need women like Rowling in our corner because not only is she a beloved figure, she's so rich that she doesn't have to worry about her income being slashed or becoming financially destitute as a result of being ""cancelled"". So she can say things that many other women WANT to say but can't because they can't afford to lose their careers and reputations.

&#x200B;

TRAs can call her ""Hitler"" and ""TERF"" all they like. She'll still be collecting those sweet Harry Potter royalty checks!"
92,,astheykissconsume,"""Joanne Andrea,""¬†I said quietly, ""you were named for two censored feminists. One of them was called a TERF and she was probably¬†the bravest woman I ever knew."""
93,,writerlylesbian,"Hilariously, I remember back in the early 2000s when it was the religious right who were banning Harry Potter books for being full of the devil's work. Now the Left have met them on the other side of the horseshoe and are banning the books too!"
94,,mossmalachite,"In a FB group that‚Äôs something like, ‚Äúliking harry potter isn‚Äôt a personality trait‚Äù where people post like over the top HP themed weddings and people naming their kids Albus, and they‚Äôre absolutely going off about how transphobic it is and all the ‚ÄúAS A WOMAN WITH A PENIS I AM SO SAD TO KNOW I WOULDNT BE ALLOWED AT HOGWARTS‚Äù and I had to come here and read logical reactions to regain my sanity"
95,,glitteristheanswer,"Original tweet was awesome and she clearly knows what shes doing! If I didnt work in games and animation I'd retweet with a million confetti horn emojis! Really depressing to see my entire timeline filled with people I look up to in my field or consider intelligent equals saying ""if you're a terf you can go die"" and just repeating ""trans rights are human rights""

No they're fucking not frankly, they're exceptional not standard. Human rights (for women,for minority groups, for disabled people) are rights and protections you CANT CHANGE. If you change your mind on your gender WELL LOOK AT THAT YOU CHANGED AND IT MEANS ITS SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY THAT ISNT IMMUTABLE. That makes any request for those rights or protections exceptional, a luxury,NOT a requirement"
96,,tgrewy,"A beautiful peak trans end to a decade of madness.
Hi r/all please read links in the sidebar and also visit r/itsafetish or r/actuallynotlesbians for more great content."
97,,LucyWColitisGoesBy,"> Trans folks have an extraordinary high suicide rate... can we just let them have the identity they want please? They're not doing anyone any harm. Leave them alone.

Some of these people are so full of shit it's coming out of their ears. The fact that mentally ill men kill themselves is not our problem. Why the fucking hell should all the women of the world have to agree that a woman is a identity for a mentally ill man to have?

As for not doing any harm that's a laugh. This woman is being fired for stating they're not women. Rowling is being called horrible names for standing at her side. How about they leave us alone?"
98,,milpathecat,I am so happy and just came here to say I love all women of Gender Critical and especially the mods and veterans for doing the hard work for years!!!! You absolute stars!
99,,UterusUnderground,"Honestly, seeing what feels like the entire female nerd establishment coming for Rowling‚Äôs neck makes me feel so hopeless. It‚Äôs so hard to be reminded that women that I once felt so much kinship with are caught up in this misogynist ideology almost to a fault. I saw Siobhan Thomas tweet that Rowling was a bitch who should retire, and it just broke my heart. Mara Wilson, Noelle Stevenson, Kate Beaton... I know that these women are libfems, they have to be to get anywhere in the nerd establishment, but it‚Äôs still disheartening to be reminded of how intolerant and extremist the whole scene has become. Or maybe it always was? I think I finally understand what the gamergaters meant when they said they wanted politics out of nerd media (even if I otherwise think they were a bunch of fools).

I am so glad Christmas is happening and I at least won‚Äôt be seeing my irl nerd friends until this has hopefully calmed down a bit, because I‚Äôm sure they would talk about it and I just can‚Äôt deal with that. I just want to agree to disagree and move on to talking about Godzilla."
100,,OCPEoireitum,"I was raised to think that accusations of thoughtcrime, crimethink, and wrongthink were worse than the blasphemy they sought to punish. FYI I am a man (adult human male) - and suspect that we both read, interpret and take lessons from Orwell in exactly the same way.

That was a very scary judgment.....and the decision, to use a legal term - seems ‚Äòperverse‚Äô indeed."
101,,slushpilot,"From the BBC article:

>""It is a core component of her belief that she will refer to a person  by the sex she considered appropriate even if it violates their dignity  and/or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or  offensive environment,"" he continued.
>
>""The approach is not worthy of respect in a democratic society.""

So, calling things as you see them is not allowed in a democratic society? Have we no freedom to think as individuals anymore? What makes such a society *democratic,* then?"
102,,BoringDisorder,"People are acting like she said transpeople don't deserve rights or respect. She literally just said that a woman should not lose her job for acknowledging biological sex. You can't change it. Maybe one day that technology will exist, but it doesn't currently. That's like someone saying ""believe what you want, but don't fire someone for saying the earth isn't flat"" and it causing huge outrage. Hard sciences exist and we shouldn't cover our ears and act like theory is more viable.

She probably knew there'd be a lot of backlash and posted the tweet anyways. Proud of her."
103,,Amareldys,Someone rich and famous finally stood up for women! JK Rowling if you read this board... I LOVE YOU!

Who the fuck said she hates you? You're just not a woman. FFS.

I knew what it would be like, but the pile on she's experiencing now is just incredible.

126,,ZombieSazza,"In Scotland the number 3 trending hashtag is ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äù, number 5 being ‚ÄúI Stand With Maya Forstater‚Äù.

So twitter is at war of trans folk losing their shit and shouting ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äù, gender critical folk pointing out ‚Äúbut women‚Äôs rights aren‚Äôt trans rights‚Äù, lots of threats towards Rowling, lots of folk speaking out in favour of Rowling including gender critical Scottish MP Joan McAlpine and Blair White, and several trans folk supporting Rowling as well (sadly being drowned out), basically a bit of a war zone.

Vast majority of Scottish folk I‚Äôve seen online support what Rowling has said.

Maya Lost her job for being gender critical, and folk are trying to claim she was horrible etc, but she was calm, makes sense, is defending women‚Äôs rights, and trans folk are screaming over the top of everyone, including Amnesty International,

Yesterday, a UK court upheld this woman's firing, claiming that her statement that people could not change sex was incoherent and incompatible with a democratic society.

This is how it happens!

I will lose a job in a hot minute for something like this but then again I had a tough upbringing & am really not with the bullshit. Also my value lies outside of capitalism and its demands so I really do not give a shit about some poncey woke male telling me to swing my hook bc I made a man in fishnets uncomfortable. I just think about the Nazi's to remind myself of the importance of speaking up for morality against the madness of crowds. So often people make out like they are trapped in their job- no you have trapped yourself in that job...the world is very big and there's plenty of employers who won't force you to believe biological sex is a lie. Way more than you think in fact...or worse comes to worse work at home/online for an agency. Work for yourself and cut out the woke middle man. Connect with your sisters, I'm sure at least one knows a position going or a lawyer of some kind. Don't allow them to make you feel fearful and trapped

Damn...it was only 30 years ago marital rape was legal...wake up women! We aren't as safe as you think! Our rights need constant defence in the numbers! Think of the bigger picture!

I hear a lot of women talking a big feminist empowerment game nowadays but when it comes to supporting their sisters in difficult situations and saying SEX IS REAL they are somehow easily swayed into silence or the 'ummm ermmm I don't know'?

They definitely are infatuated with womanhood to the point of violence, probably even more often than the average man, which is really saying something.

I'm sorry but in 2019 I'm kinda cringed out by the sheer number of women who have allowed someone to convince them biological sex isn't real& to give up the rights of other women without any solid evidence whatsoever to confirm this. I mean its not a complicated thing- biological sex is MATERIALLY evident- it takes some passivity to believe its not. Its one thing to know its bs and not speak out of fear...but its another entirely to actually buy into behind closed doors & be part of its manifestation throwing other women under the bus for some woke SJW points for a tiny mentally unstable minority. I think the latter set of women need to have an even stronger word with themselves than the former. As in they clearly need to learn to have humility/ assertiveness. Some of these women had to be told 28874329 examples of why this is a bad idea for them to finally get it- I think that signals ignorance.

I don't want to hear your feminist views if you're all fluff when it comes to defending our boundaries. Thats just lip service- and we need more action. We need more women that put their foot down when they're say they're going to

I never bought it- I remember the first time I got put in the hot seat for my views in a room full of lib fem students who already despised me for not being a hipster....and the minute I spoke up they fell silent and the trans lecturer called me transphobic...but you could tell on their faces they wanted to nod and agree. They were just scared.. & I thought WTF? Are we back in the 50s??? Whats the point having access to education/ right to vote if women aren't going to use their voices???!

I couldn't NOT say anything because it sounded so bullshit...and was being taught to people in higher education- I immediately wanted to debate what he was saying. It was like a lecturer claiming the earth is flat to a bunch of naive paying students

All for asking what happens to womens boundaries if we allow men to say they're women...that was my crime

To me this just signals something off is happening with British healthcare- they have been selling bits off to private healthcare firms for some time. I truly believe one motivation for them doing this is to overwhelm the NHS with trans patients thus pushing it further into desperation that can only be 'saved' through more privatisation (I mean seriously- its costs MONEY to dish out these hormone blockers/medical transitions/mediate lifelong effects). And I believe this even more so because trans culture is very established/widespread in America where for profit healthcare is already the same  (they NEED customers= ¬£¬£¬£¬£). With free healthcare there is incentive to keep people well as that drains the government less & keeps costs down. Thus to me, this signals Britain's NHS moving towards a for profit structure.

And ofc the icing on the cake is that they can erode womens hard fought boundaries that they resent allowing us have (to a degree). Can't have equality if you can't tell who's who!!

Yeah exactly! People overlook this aspect when I mention it as if its a conspiracy but its really not. The NHS has been struggling for some time due to forced austerity since the financial crash etc...and quite frankly the NHS could do WITHOUT a huge influx of trans kids and all their complications adding to the bill. I mean the trans journey is quite a long & costly experience...and the government funded NHS has to foot the bill for taht.

If anyone is curious why TIMs insist on entering womens sports even though everyone can see they have an unfair advantage, in order for a sex change to be 100% and never mentioned again legally, they need to be included as women for sporting events. TIMs being banned from female sporting events would mean their actual sex would always have to be a matter of record. So they will fight this one to the death. It's probably going to be one of the things that sink in the court of public opinion because it's obvious even to the average sports fan a TIM has an unfair advantage over women.

You'll also notice the article avoids the fact that recent research is showing they maintain male muscle strength even after T blockers, and TIMs are two SD large than females. Which means an average size TIM has at least a 2SD head start in terms of strength on plain old Jane. This means only about only about 1/40 women is as strong or stronger as the average TIM.

EDIT: just realised a some of you won't know what 'SD' means. It's [standard deviation](http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) and it's referring to a distribution curve. The average man is 6 inches taller than the average woman.

>	Yet we don‚Äôt see any great rush to divide lifting categories by race (which of course would be ridiculous), proving this bone-density argument to be nothing but a canard designed to specifically target trans athletes.

Weightlifters would have a much higher bone density than if they didn't do that sport  Lifting weights is recommended to build bone mass.  Comparing a man who transitioned recently, and a weightlifter at that,  to the senior transgenders in general is misleading and a red herring as usual.

Not sure if bone density as much to do as muscle and upper body strength, in weightlifting anyway.

Edit:

Also, after menopause, it is loss of 'estrogen' a that makes women susceptible to menopause.  Most probably it is the loss of testosterone in TIMs that make them susceptible.

There are genetic differences in different populations of people. These differences exist in hair type, skull shape and population genetics. Scientists can examine  skeletonized remains and determine what population of people they came from. They wouldn't be able to do that if humans weren't genetically different.

650,,not_mean_enough,Great advice for getting arrested in most countries.
651,,goblinf,"oh sorry. I didn't mean actual identity cards. I meant (in the UK) where when you become a client of say a solicitor you have to show them that you have existed for a long time, and they have to google you to check you don't fall into particular categories. So if someone has a name change, like say a Lord coming into an inheritance, they provide birth cert with birth name, then deed poll to current title, because the other documents will have the original name until the deed poll, then the new name afterwards. The system is created to cope with there being a change of name.
Similarly if you are a woman and get married and take your husband's name, except there you provide the marriage certificate.

There's a continuity of ID.

Whereas withthe self ID legislation (that's just been kicked into the long grass here in the UK) there's an assumption that there's a prior 'dead name' that won't ever be used again. And the new name. Well that's just NOT feasible in a society that, for example, has antimoney laundering rules to protect against terrorism and crime. The protection has a higher public good than the attempt to stop dead naming.

Not sure that's any clearer. But basically, if you change your name, your old name/existence follows you. As Freddie the seahorse has found - the court said only women can give birth to kids, therefore your current name is on the birth certificate, under the mother box not the father box. The law is interested in what's going to make sense in society for the long term - not magical thinking currently in vogue.

We don't actually have ID cards in teh UK, it was mooted but there was such an outcry it didn't happen. Which is fine, until you don't have a passport or a driving licence, then since 9/11 and the changes in ID verification rules, doing anything official becomes a nightmare...."

""If the lesbians who don‚Äôt like dick see a post about lesbians who like dick (girl dick only obv) then they can ignore it. They need to work through their ‚Äúknee jerk reaction‚Äù bcuz it can become a transphobic reaction real quick.""

~~For many years, until the big blow-up last week, actuallesbians linked [this post](https://archive.is/iO8AP) on the sidebar.~~ Actually, they took it down briefly, but it's back up; this shit is *still* the official policy of bring/AL. The author of the post concedes that no one *has* to date transwomen, but makes it clear that if you don't date transwomen, it reflects poorly on your character:

>You aren't into penii *[sic]*. I get it, and for what it's worth neither am I. To be fair, many trans women who carry that particular anatomical burden are not big fans of it either, so you have that in common at least. But many trans women don't, and many of those who do won't for long. **Be careful about using this biased sample to rule out all trans women.**

>Also, **would you rule someone out because she had six toes?** Whenever I hear a straight man ask how sex works in the absence of a penis, I feel sorry for his girlfriends/wife, because he clearly doesn't understand how sexytimes work; **when I hear a lesbian rule out trans women because of the presence of a hidden penis I feel sorry for her partner, because how superficial is that?**

So yeah. There is actually immense, ubiquitous pressure on lesbians to be open to dating transwomen, and you clearly don't know what the fuck you're talking about."

Orgasm in the postoperative transsexual.

Abstract

The dearth of information regarding organism [sic] in postoperative transsexuals prompted the authors to study its prevalence. The sample consisted of 14 male-to-female (M-F) and 9 female-to-male (F-M) postoperative transsexuals. The relationship of orgasm to sexual and general satisfaction was explored via a specially designed questionnaire. Orgastic capacity declined in the M-F group and increased in the (F-M) group. Despite the decrease in orgasm in the M-F group, satisfaction with sex and general satisfaction with the results of surgery were high in both groups. General satisfaction of 86% replicates other studies. Frequency of sex increased by 75% in the M-F group and by 100% in the F-M group. A phalloplasty does not appear to be a critical factor in orgasm or in sexual satisfaction. The general conclusion is reached that it is possible to change one's body image and sexual identity and be sexually satisfied despite inadequate sexual functioning."

If you don‚Äôt see why that‚Äôs a problem, you‚Äôre blind. Lesbians have to overcome compulsory heterosexuality, and imagine overcoming the hardest hurdle to accepting who you are, and then someone from inside your own house (lgbt community) says what sounds like the exact same thing.

SOCIETY: You have to like dick, sleep with men.

LESBIAN: I‚Äôve tried to overcome it but I just don‚Äôt like dick, I quite like women, actually. I think I‚Äôll date women from now on.

LGBT COMMUNITY: You like women? That‚Äôs great. These women have dicks and you have to be open to sleeping with them because they are more vulnerable than you and women can have dicks.

LESBIAN: Actually I just like vulva. I don‚Äôt want to be involved with a dick.

LGBT COMMUNITY: WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU‚ÄôRE SAYING? You can‚Äôt say that!! There‚Äôs plenty of ways to have sex without PIV penetration, you know!

And just real quick? Most of us have experienced this phenomenon. So I don‚Äôt understand where you get off, thinking you can come into our place and tell us how our experiences work. We have conversations here. We don‚Äôt just TELL each other how things are, that‚Äôs it, no other opinions."

TIFs are taking testosterone which will boost sex drive and with nerves retained from clitoris, which is twice as enervated as penis, it makes physiological sense that TIFs are more sexually satisfied post surgery. I wish it were less sexually rewarding in terms of social consequences but at least I understand transitioning more, given this information.

The bright point of what I read was that some TIMs will only masturbate rather than seek out sexual partners, due to the complexity of their genital situation. I honestly do feel badly for them but am relieved that the conflict of having TIMs pushing for sexual acceptance in lesbian social spaces may be lessened by some TIMs choosing to take things into their own hands.

914,,TAgurl,"I used to wax both men and women. Every man who had genital waxing got an erection. 100%. Most were embarrassed about it and really apologetic, and there are ways as a professional to mitigate it (such as draping). You also typically have the man assist whilst you wax (to hold the skin taut - think scrotal skin); to have them ‚Äòhandle‚Äô their junk when it‚Äôs erect.

Mostly, getting an erection was an automatic response to being touched. They do not last long, especially once the pain starts (don‚Äôt want it to seem as if men have them the entire appointment).

It was not uncommon for a man to try to request more, or to suss out whether you‚Äôd offer more. Usually they tried to be subtle about it (they weren‚Äôt), but some outright asked, or just started talking sexually. They never tried this at the beginning of the appointment, all asked whilst well into the waxing.

I once had an old guy start commenting on how he loved hot wax dripped on his balls.

Some men outright begged you to ‚Äòfinish them off‚Äô, and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs always the creepy, feral men. I had many extremely attractive men hint or blatantly ask for sexual services. You have to presume that many of these men were partnered.

Didn‚Äôt matter whether the salon was highly reputable, or a suburban corner shop, both ends of the spectrum experienced unwanted sexual conduct from men.

Unfortunately, if you‚Äôre going to offer intimate waxing for men you must have policies in place to handle these situations as they WILL occur."

&#x200B;

They don't seem to understand that the trans inclusive laws they champion are exactly what empowered Yaniv to use the Canadian government to punish immigrant women for the ""crime"" of refusing to touch his genitals. And that he used the Protected Class status of trans-women to evade punishment/judgement for doing shit that would have landed anyone else in jail. It doesn't matter if 99% of TiMs are saints. The point still stands that these laws empower shady men to do exactly what Yaniv did; and that problem needs to be acknowledged and addressed.

Yaniv is only catching heat for this because his Lady LARP is so cartoonishly pervy and gross that even hardcore activists like Morgane Oger had to publicly distance themselves from him. Can you imagine how many AGPs are pulling similar shit and we're just not hearing about it because those other men aren't total morons who broadcast every creepy thing they do like Yaniv does?"
931,,PollyannaPenny,"> If not for Yaniv's abhorrent behaviour, it looks like the tribunal would have found against those two women.

If Yaniv wasn't a total moron who left receipts of his bad behavior all over the internet; he probably would have won this case."

Yaniv was able to do this because he claimed genital waxing was necessary ""gender affirming care"". So these salon workers were literally killing his inner woman by refusing to give him a ""lady wax"".

&#x200B;

Never mind the fact that the VAST majority of actual females never get a genital wax (so it's not needed for any dude's Lady LARP).

some of the justices did pen secondary opinions that a custom wedding cake is a form of art - since you have to design it - and thus, forcing the bakers to create art celebrating a gay marriage was coercing them to express something they did not believe in. it's been a while since i read the case, so i don't remember all the details, but i believe the bakery offered to sell them a premade wedding cake instead of a custom one, further delineating between 'refusing service' and 'refusing to create art.'"

Eventually, after having to take it to the US supreme court. But in this situation, both the Colorado courts and the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (CCRC) most certainly attempted to impose requirements on another group. Both the initial ruling and the appeal in Colorado was in favor of the plaintiffs. From the wiki article:

 *The case was decided in favor of the plaintiffs; the cake shop was ordered not only to provide cakes to same-sex marriages, but to ""change its company policies, provide 'comprehensive staff training' regarding public accommodations discrimination, and provide quarterly reports for the next two years regarding steps it has taken to come into compliance and whether it has turned away any prospective customers.""*

Worryingly (in my opinion), SCOTUS did NOT rule that the baker had a right to refuse to create a custom wedding cake for these two gentlemen's wedding. (For what it's worth, the baker never refused to *sell* the couple a cake. He refused to make them a custom cake.) They simply reversed the original rulings based on the CCRC's blatant hostility to the baker's Christianity, which they stated violated his first amendment rights. This leaves the door open for further attempts by woke organizations like the CCRC to impose its ideologies on private citizens.

As an aside, after SCOTUS's ruling, the CCRC decided to drop a second case against this baker, which they had brought after he refused to make a custom cake for a TIM to celebrate his transition.

&#x200B;

> Denying a service to someone because they have a different religious beliefs than you is different than forcing others to police their language, deny sex based protections and touch their genitals.

I'm not arguing that the two cases or situations are all that similar. I was simply arguing against Kabloona's statement that legalization of gay marriage does/did not impose requirements on other groups. Because there were and are quite a few organizations who are using gay marriage to do just that. Gay marriage isn't the problem. I don't even think liberalism is the problem here. It's identity politics and how it fucks us all. It takes anything regarded as ""minority"" and tries to force all of us to worship at its frequently cock-shaped altar.

All that being said, I'd argue that it's beyond absurd that either of these cases were ever even in front of a court. The country of Canada needs a judge to rule that women should not be compelled to touch a man's penis. This is fucking crazy. The US *couldn't even get a court to rule* that a local small time baker can't be forced to bake a cake for a function he doesn't agree with. Not as crazy, but pretty fucking crazy."

What makes a person trans is BELIEVING that they are a woman ""on the inside"" and that particular feeling or behaviors are evidence of that.

> Professor C√°el Keegan, who teaches Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, said the hat's reference to pink [vulvas] is suspect: *""We know that any time feminism starts centering people based on anatomy, that gets kind of dangerous for trans people.""* **He** also pointed out that both cisgender women and transgender women are fighting for autonomy over their own bodies. The hat's allusion to the [vulva] also ignores the fact that some transgender women opt against undergoing gender-affirmation surgery. Keegan said that the pussyhat can promote the unconscious suggestion that only cisgender women are raped, which is untrue. In fact, he explained, ""A lot of the reasons [transgender women] are attacked is because they do not possess that piece of anatomy.""

Feminism centering people who are female, no fucking way?? Women talking about their anatomy is dangerous for men LOL I can't even, this is too much for me."

Welcome to Reddit's most active feminist community! This is a women-centered, radical feminist subreddit to discuss gender from a critical, feminist perspective.

1269,,Hypocritical-Cunt,"So mowing the lawn triggers his dysphoria, but having his wife do his laundry, wash his dishes, and raise his children is fine.

Right. üôÑ

I‚Äôm sorry your spouse turned out to be an asshole. I wish you and your kids all the best ‚Äî which starts with removing their leech of a father from the household. Good luck."
1270,,vulvapeople,"Your husband is going to bankrupt you, and, as another commenter has mentioned, could very well be putting you in the position of paying him alimony and child support when you finally get fed up with all of this.

Once he becomes a ""stay at home wife/mother"", I know and you know and everyone here knows that you will continue to do 99 percent of the housework and child care while he studies and does his nails.

If you have another baby, he's going to breastfeed it and expose it to the cocktail of chemicals he's on to make lactation possible. If you don't approve, likely he'll do it behind your back.

Also, men don't have a good track record with paying back their wives when their wives work to put them through school. If he does manage to get through school and get a job (but knowing how TIMs like this operate, more likely he's trying to be a leech), you will see none of that money as his wife or as his ex-wife.

Lastly, is the trust fund just for you, as in he's not a beneficiary? This is your opportunity to get the hell out of this marriage, pay off your share of *his* debt, and make sure he doesn't get his grubby hands on the money *your* relative gave you."
1271,,,">This is probably going to be rambly, sorry.

No sorry! So many people who turn up here start with some version of ""Sorry."" It's ok! You're allowed to rant. We're not going to hurt you and you have every right in the world to be heard.

&#x200B;

>Honestly I was originally going to post this in relationships, or the sub for spouses of trans people, but a friend suggested here.

If I said ""Yeah you probably would have gotten shouted down."" that would be isolating behavior, which I absolutely don't want to do. Instead I'll say ""We have seen other people post in those subs in the past and they were shouted down."" If, however, you are seeking alternative points of view, their input may be valuable.

&#x200B;

>(Like she wanted to jump straight to breastfeeding despite barely being into her transition; it was costly and not something, from our research, that would help our baby much if at all and would purely be for her benefit. In the end the cost made her agree to put the idea aside (but not without a lot of tears from both of us)).

Holy shit, yeah. I'm glad this fell through. Male bodies cannot make the breastmilk you would have needed for your babies health. While it's true that male humans can lactate, it is ABSOLUTELY not the same thing nutritionally speaking as the breastmilk of a mother. I'm sure you know this already, since you *are* a mom, but you have different ""milks"" based on how far you are from the baby's birth, and each stage of that milk is balanced in such a way as to keep the baby healthy and alive. It changes. Male milk doesn't.

Another critically important thing on the milk subject is that you produce sugars in your milk meant to feed your baby's symbiotic bacteria so they protect the baby from harmful outside bacteria (not the baby itself, your child actually can't digest or use those sugars when they're a newborn). Male milk can't do that either.

&#x200B;

>My wife is high maintenance. She gets to go to a nice salon for her hair care and waxing needs, she owns a dozen nice bras, she has a complicated skin routine, she gets to tan and get new clothes and owns way more shoes then I do.

Regardless of whether or not this person is trans. If one parent is saving for the children and the other is doing this crap, then they would be seen- rightfully so- an an irresponsible parent. They don't get a pass.

&#x200B;

>She still gets home, eats dinner with us, *then hangs out in the kitchen with me and the kids while I do the dishes and clean up*. She tells me about her day. I like this part honestly, but I wish she would help because it would get done a lot faster if both of us were doing it.

Can't even be bothered to help you clean up and give you a chance to hang out with your children? That's shitty behavior. Again, this person doesn't get a pass just because they're trans.

&#x200B;

I'm going to be very blunt here, but again, please feel free to seek out alternative points of view. You know we're biased here, and I acknowledge that.

&#x200B;

**That said. I think you should leave. I think you** ***need*** **to leave.**

&#x200B;

This person is treating you like a ""fuckmommy"". They aren't supporting you mentally, physically, or financially. Put simply, you do not have a partner, you have an extra large additional child and you don't need another one.

You say you're being treated like ""the help""? I'm sorry to break it to you, but that's what you are right now.

I‚Äôll tell you what, though. *You* deserve to be loved. What this man is doing to you is not love.

This is an extremely abusive relationship. Your wife/husband/whatever the hell he wants to call himself or identify as (does not matter) is an abuser. His behavior is so entitled and selfish that it‚Äôs comical. How the hell can a grown ass adult think it‚Äôs even remotely acceptable to take advantage of his spouse like this? You are literally going without things you need (like BRAS) because he all of a sudden decided that he wanted to live out his fantasy of what a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is?

Everyone says this, but get a lawyer. Once you divorce that guy he is probably going to try and sue for custody and he is obviously not deserving of that. And for the love of god do NOT SHARE ANY OF YOUR TRUST MONEY WITH HIM. You‚Äôve got to protect yourself and you‚Äôve got to protect your kids, and money can give you a means of achieving that protection. I repeat, DO NOT GIVE THIS MAN ANY MONEY.

Keep thinking about the welfare of your babies, too. This is not someone they should be around, and he likely hangs out with people that could potentially hurt them. Your kids are way more important than anything he‚Äôll cry about, way more important than his goddamned hucow pregnancy fetish (that‚Äôs literally what this shit is), his cross dressing and his narcissism.

Your husband started transitioning while you were pregnant? That's really common. They cant stand someone else being the center of attention.


Then he wanted to breastfeed? That's *sick.* As you said, it wouldn't do anything to benefit the baby, it's all about him getting what he wants. He wants to use your infant as a prop at best and a sex toy at worst. Then he cried over not being allowed to waste your very tight money on abusing your infant??


Now he's driving you into debt for his vanity. He doesn't do his share of the childcare or housework.


""I'm treated like the help"" That's what you are. You are not in a marriage and from the looks of it you never have been. You are his servant. Your life is only to support him.


""A relative of mine left a trust fund to be given to me when I turn 30. That's in six months"" That's why he's still around. I was wondering, usually they transition while the wife is pregnant, and then once the baby is a toddler they start sleeping around and eventually ditch her to life a life of 'freedom' with their new trans friends. I was wondering why he was still around and here it is, he wants to live his life of freedom on your money. As soon as it goes in to your shared accounts he will be entitled to use it and he will. Divorce will take longer than 6 months. Find a way to delay this or immediately put it into a savings account in your name only that can't be touched for another few years. If you don't he will leave you broke with two kids, I guarantee it.


Separate now, don't wait another day. Yes he has always been this selfish. No he will never change. You have never been in a marriage, you have been a prop in his fantasy life. A marriage is an equal partnership. You never had that. It sounds like you had a fucked up childhood and that damaged your expectations for what a relationship should be. Don't let your kids suffer the same way. Show them how a person respects themselves."

This alone says so much more than you might realize. To me, it says that even on the outside looking in, your brother knows something isn't right with your marriage even beyond the trans aspects. That your brother is, as a man, looking at the track record of your wife/husband and finding it lacking. The trans aspect of this situation is just the candy coating most people might see first, hiding the truth of the matter, which is that your wife/husband does not partake equally in homemaking, childrearing, or financially."

1292,,DextersXXarmy,"I never use Reddit and signed up just to respond to this, because I have a friend that went through this exact thing, and a few others that had to deal w the courts regarding custody/divorce/abuse:

PLEASE DO NOT underestimate your spouse. At all. Never assume you know how they will respond. This is hard to do because you feel you know them, but this an abusive, dangerously entitled, male. I would not put it past them to be dangerous or vidictive when told they cannot have what they want. You have kids, which they may see as a way to hurt or control you.

You're seeing the very best of their behavior right now because you have something they want- inheritance and a chance to play mommy. What's going to happen once they realize their meal ticket AND validation is leaving? *Hopefully nothing*, but it's best to plan for the very worst, because telling men NO brings out their rage. And telling a man NO that is entitled enough to ""play woman"" on your dime is likely to be even worse.

In practical terms, this means planning quietly and making sure you have a safety plan in place. It may seem extreme, but if you can talk to a DV specialist about how to safely leave, you really should. It cannot hurt.

Document EVERYTHING, and save every single text, phone call, email, everything. Get an app that records everything off your device. Write doen everything they have done that has been harmful. Never say or type anything that you wouldn't want read in court.

I know this sounds majorly paranoid, but I watched a few friends get trounced in court by (and lose custody to) abusers, because they tried to be conciliatory and reasonable. The abusers had every text, my friends did not. Even little things like being 10 min late a few times adds up when read to the court.

Be a shark, even though you might want to be the bigger person, so you don't lose custody and end up paying this asshole support too.

Also- you mentioned moving. It's ok to try to position yourself in the best possible place to win. I guarantee your spouce will take every advantage they can, and hes starting ahead of you. Do your homework and try to get the odds in your favor. I'm so happy you can get a lawyer because that will make all the difference.

Like when they act like you‚Äôre the help and make no effort to include you in conversations, at your own house. You are clearly a strong woman who has stuff going for her. Your wife is lucky to have you, holding everything down. Tread carefully with therapy as many therapists are in the transcult and will fall for the pity parties and crocodile tears. Beware that it seems like your wife might be jealous of you, which is simply misogyny since he is jealous of the seemingly good things about being female and doesn‚Äôt know half of the negatives. This spending issue would have me extremely worried. If he wants fancy clothes maybe he could find a thrift store. IF I were you I would be doing anything to protect the oncoming assets for the benefit of your children, screw letting him blow it all. I was raised in a family with narcissistic traits, trust me, he will have no qualms spending it all on himself on shit he don‚Äôt need and leaving nothing for you and the kids. Please take care"
1294,,MarkTwainiac,"OP, I am so sorry you are dealing with such a selfish spouse who has gaslighted you in so many ways. Your story brought tears to my eyes, made me glad I'm divorced & long single, & called to my mind a question attributed to Dorothy Parker: what fresh hell is this?

I agree with all the other posters so far, but thought it might be helpful to add one point: It's not clear where you are from, but if you are from the USA, please be aware that states vary in how they view wealth inherited before as well as during a marriage. In some states, inherited wealth is included in community property; in other states, it's totally excluded. So depending on where you live, your spouse might not have a valid claim to/on your inheritance. A good lawyer can advise.

Also, there's no need to borrow money in order to consult a divorce or matrimonial lawyer. With top-flight matrimonial attorneys in the US, the first appointment & attendant advice is always free - & if it's not, the lawyer is probably an unethical shyster.  What's more, if you are coming into an inheritance in the foreseeable future, any decent divorce or matrimonial attorney will take you on (if you want) & bill you later.  They are accustomed to this.

I feel for you & wish you & your kids all the best."

Let's put this in gender-neutral terms: your partner is driving you into debt because they need money to maintain a certain image of themselves.

You deserve so much better.

And, in case anyone calls you a transphobe, please remember this: in the most charitable, pro-trans terms, transition is a lifelong medical, psychological, and physical journey.

You need to be spending time with people who are going to back you and who are going to be pulling you away from trans cult talk and into rational lets treat people on their actions talk.

I would discuss this quickly with a divorce lawyer and figure out how to protect your assets. Those assets are going to be needed to support yourself and your children and not the uncontrolled spending of your partner.

In most states, just leaving the marital home is the start of an unofficial separation and any moneys made after that aren‚Äôt considered community property. But leaving the home could also be considered abandonment depending on the state and if you own your current house it could also be construed as you giving up claims to it. Again...all that depends on your state.

I would work as fast and quickly as possible to serve her with paperwork in order to get the ball rolling. And clearly they have zero concern for your well being, your mental health, fiscal health or your children.  This is beyond unacceptable and absolutely selfish on their part.

You deserve a partner who is actually your partner. There is nothing here that shows they are anything else but completely selfish at this point.

1 my dad behaved the same way, he usted to buy for him the best clothes, the best shoes etc while my mother would never buy anything for herself even nowadays she struggles to get nice things for herself she would always prefer to buy things for me and my sister
2.

3.

4. He would be very mean to my mother also with my sister and I but with his friends he would always be super kind and supportive so if my mother complained about him nobody would believe her

You go without and see to it that the laundry is done, the yard is mowed, and dinner is cooked because that is what women do. We do stuff because it needs to be done, not for any other reason.

Time and again, I see stories of men who transition, spend countless dollars to look the part, but never play the part of an actual woman.

Did he seriously think he could breastfeed the baby? WTF?"
1322,,XYfreeradical,"Ugh ‚Äî so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Whoever came up with the idea of marriage must have been a real sadist.

I would talk to a lawyer and try to understand the financial situation better ‚Äî the specifics will depend on what state you‚Äôre in.  Usually an inheritance is considered separate property, and you should make sure you keep it separate and anything you buy with it from all the other marital assets.  You probably should NOT pay off debt that your husband incurred with that money.  Ask the lawyer how his debt is treated, etc.  you may or may not be liable for it.

Also, if you decide to stay together for some reason, I think you can usually sign a postnup so that any future income and debt is kept separate."

1334,,nutzphobic,"Great, and unanimous advice on this thread. Like [DextersXXarmy](https://www.reddit.com/user/DextersXXarmy), I created an account to respond to this thread.

Even if the trans component was not a factor, it would still be regarded as an abusive relationship, both mental and financial abuse. It won't improve, and will only get worse until you trust has been exhausted, then he will leave you. As one or two have said, I would also get the advice from a women's DV centre, because when this person gets wind that the money he planned to use for yet more frilly bras is about to be taken away, things could go badly really quickly. As Dexter and a few others recommended, do your planning on the quiet, and I would add, delete this thread soon.

We know he is manipulating you ‚Äî he apparently can no longer do chores like mow the lawn, because it 'triggers his gender dysphoria' ‚Äî yet has no qualms in using a penis to impregnate you (something he also did 'as a man'). Rather *selective dysphoria*. You are being played. Get out while you can, and before any more financial and emotional damage is done.

Good luck with your exit. Please take care, I cannot stress that enough."

1352,,_Revulva_,"I'm sorry that you're not getting the support you need from those around you.

The best decisions about the future can only be made based on what you know in the present. You know that money is being taken away from you and your kids. Now your inheritance is coming in and your spouse already has that money earmarked for a new car and education for him. Given the current situation you'll be slaving away with a third child in ratty second hand clothes while you're spouse lives like a king and enjoys the fruits of what your family intended for you.

Your spouse does nothing around the house, no inside or outside chores. He goes to work, comes home and while you're slaving away he shares his stories and problems but never offers to help. Your partner can't take care of the kids. There is no partnership. They're doing nothing to support you and to hold up their end. Instead it's just taking and taking.

Please just imagine if a friend had come to you with this. How would you counsel her?

My spouse came out trans May 2018. I don't call him ""her, she"" or by the new name they paid for. I was very supportive in the beginning, but as time went on I couldn't.
The hormones make them so emotional.
I've heard all the ""I'm sad I can't get pregnant"" ""I wish I could breastfeed""
He also doesn't help with the house or kids. He even told me the kids feel like adopted kids because he didn't give birth to them, so it's hard to bond with them.
Please don't give him your money. You really have to take care of yourself. Go to school, get a better job, and take care of your children.

I would not be surprised if your spouse reacts very poorly to your ending the marriage.  The level of self-absorption is high.  Keep this quiet, get your legal ducks in order, make sure you gave copies of critical documents, and wait to announce until you are ready."

1374,,AssignedMomAtBirth,"I‚Äôm so sorry that you are going through this. Have you read about autogynephelia ? If not, you need to. Your husband sounds like a textbook example.  Autogynephilia, or transvestic fetishism, is a sexual paraphillia. And sexual paraphillias tend to cluster.  For example , Many autogynephiles are also exhibitionists, masochists, ‚Äúadult babies‚Äù. Pediphiles, Etc. I would get on his computer and search his porn use  to see what you are dealing with at once, and find out how to document it legally in case you need it for custody / divorce.  If you find something really unsettling, you may need to call a lawyer or even the police. Be ready for that possibility when you do this. There is also an overlap of autogynephelia with personality disorders and narcissism. And when they take hormones, they can become very unstable. This is all very damaging to you and the kids. I would suggest that you get out of the marriage at once.  Stay with relatives or something until you can get your money and a new job home and school for your kids , a divorce and pay off debt.

One other thing I need to say is that your baby should NOT be breastfed by a transitioning male via chemically induced lactation.  This has been done once at Mt Sinai using dangerous drugs.  there are no studies to prove that this is safe for the baby, and even if there were , I wouldn‚Äôt trust them. Common sense says NO to this.  It‚Äôs likely part of his particular fetish , as could be pregnancy and periods. Jamie Shoupe  is a former transwomen who had autogynephelia and is very open about his experience. If you want to help your husband you need to be honest with him that he isn‚Äôt a women but he has a fetish which has spiraled out of control and it‚Äôs destroying your family.  If he is reasonable he will recognize this and seek help. Therapy cbt and Drugs can be taken to reduce compulsion and depression that come with cross dressing. This is the better way to deal with things as opposed to enabling his delusion.

There is a community of trans widows.  I  met one recently and I‚Äôve seen many posts from them on twitter and reddit.

Again I‚Äôm really sorry that you are going though this.

Also , You need to prioritize your own health and safety and that of the kids and stop being a doormat for your abusive husband.  If you choose to stay, rules need to be set for equal distribution of work , childcare, spending  and chores. Debt needs to be paid off at once and no more shopping/ hair/nail for hubby until you‚Äôre in a position to afford that sort of expense. You‚Äôll probably need a lot of money for CBT therapy and medications for your husband. Is that how you want to spend your inheritance ?

And absolutely NO male babysitters, period.  That includes transwomen. Sorry, there are just way too many stories of sexual abuse to take that risk.

Good luck to you."
1375,,lala4now,Honestly I don't see this as a trans issue so much as it being about your husband not being the person you married anymore. Which happens sometimes. People change. It sucks.

No sign of the fact that living with a full-blown narcissist is damaging to you and your kids and that YOU ARE BEING ABUSED.  Don't believe the hype.  You need to take care of yourself and your kids and stop catering to this abuser.  Leave.  Take your kids.  Contact a domestic abuse hotline.  they might be able to connect you with a shelter in the state you desire to live in.  Lie like a rug.  Don't give him a single clue about what you're planning.  There's no reason to think that he won't continue manipulating you the way he has been.  And, if he thinks he can't get his way, there's also no reason to think he won't use physical means to keep you in place.

Right now, all you can think about is your kids.  Let that motivate you.  So many of these guys are paedophiles and abusers.  Not all, but a lot.

Having dealt with narcissistic partners myself, I encourage you to leave now.  I think you may be in physical danger right now.  Even if violence was never part of the relationship before, do you think that's not Plan B when Mr. Asshole realizes he's losing out on the free play money?  He'll throw you against the wall and stomp on your neck before you even talk to that lawyer.  Get out of the house now.  Pack a suitcase with valuables and the papers you need, take the kids and go to your brother, a shelter, a hotel, anywhere.  What do you think his mental process is right now?  People like him are psychic where their interests are concerned.   HE KNOWS you aren't happy and are getting uppity.  Run right now.  It won't hurt your case, it will help it actually.

You're not a bad person for leaving someone who makes you work this hard. Men may identify as women but they don't change. I was just reading about how men are far more likely to leave a wife for getting sick than the other way around. Women are far more loyal. The way your spouse is acting you can probably expect he would keep acting like a  man as he is doing now, expecting you do to do all the home labor, and if you get sick will be on his way. It's important that you don't let this notion that he isn't a man somehow make you believe he's different than other men. ALL MEN tell you they are not like other men and they can be trusted when they are working to best take advantage of you. Run. Take your money and go. And spend it on YOURSELF.

I just wanted to add that I find very odd his way of dealing with dysphoria: working out at the gym doesn't increase his muscles? And more importantly, fathering a third child (impregnating his wife with his penis) doesn't trigger his dysphoria?
This guy is not transitioning. He's only putting make up on his face. And everyone in his family is siding with him regardless of his wrongdoings, which is very dangerous for you.

We've seen over and over that a trans spouse will drain away all the financial resources for their transition ‚Äì and then just keep taking. Any reasonable person would feel badly about doing this to you. Leave and don't let your spouse get any of your trust money if you can work that out. Learn about financial management, go to debtor's anonymous if you have to (it's actually very supportive and not as dogmatic as other 12-steps), but get out of the debt lifestyle for your own sanity.

I‚Äôm a woman and it isn‚Äôt every aspect of my life. I don‚Äôt disregard others to make myself feel better as a woman. I don‚Äôt whine to other men and treat them different because I have periods and they don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt envy men for something they cannot control, so I‚Äôm not sure why she envies you for simply existing (being able to get pregnant and the sorts). Honestly it‚Äôs bullshit. Idk what it is about this theme that makes it okay for some trans women to completely revert back to children. In this political climate we have today, they are cradled by an entire movement like babies; so much so that they forget that they are adults and that their feelings and needs do not come first in every aspect of life. I‚Äôd expect a child to think/feel/act this way because children are to be dependent and protected by society and the adults around them. But I‚Äôll be damned if I sit here and hold a 30 year olds hand and allow them to act like my children. God bless you and get out while you can. Unless she can look beyond her damn self for 2 seconds out of the 10 years y‚Äôall have been together, I don‚Äôt see this being beneficial or salvageable for you.

I suggest coming up with a plan b over the next few months. Talk to a divorce lawyer to come up with a plan. Slowly disconnect yourself emotionally from your spouse. Read this sub. Document their behavior to reinforce why you want to leave. Educate yourself on the financial side of divorce, and staying married to a man who racks up debt. come up with a plan to financially protect yourself as much as possible. Find a confidant who will help you make this transition to being single again because it will be scary and painful at times.

Just a few tips, as I'm a single parent as well: buying a house is not worth it. My parents used to own one and the expenses like new central heating, .. can really break your neck when you don't have savings. Just renting something makes your income more planned. I've lived in cheap appartment blocks for most of my life and there are really good ones, very central in the city that have playgrounds in the garden and everything. You get used to it. If you can afford it, there are houses to rent as well. I also buy everything, from furniture to clothing thrifted or on flea markets. There are special flea markets for children's stuff, you should really look out for those! They usually have shoes as well. I was glad about that since good shoes are necessary for children and they can be really expensive. A library card is a good idea as well, my daughter just started reading.

1441,,RaspberryInk,"\[edit\] I just read my post, and I'd just like to say from the start that I'm sorry you're going through this. It sounds really difficult, and I hope you have the support you need. The end of a marriage is rough, no matter the circumstances.

&#x200B;

To me it sounds like your SO is using (abusing) being trans and your love and accommodation for her to act like a spoiled, self-centered brat. This is probably mostly caused by deep, pervasive insecurity on her part, but it sounds like the insecurity is taking over as she tries way too hard to achieve a probably unachievable/unrealistic view of what it means to be ""female."" It sounds like there's some significant maturing that she needs to do, which probably needs a lot more therapy. I would expect there's a lifetime of work on her part, and depending on her own personality, it could even be unachievable. Real, deep change is always a long and difficult process.

More importantly, it's not your responsibility to solve her problems. Her internal emotional/psychological struggles are her own. It sounds like you've been supportive and tried, which IMO, is what a spouse should do. It's not a failing on your part if your SO has things that you can't resolve. Like you, I've always had a deep seated view that marriage is forever, but I had my marriage end due to my SO's mental illness. Like you, I struggled for a while with feeling like a failure for ""giving up."" I was unsure of myself and didn't know if I was making the right decision. It took years to work through it--no matter the circumstances, or how right the decision, ending a marriage is a tragic experience. Even if it's right, it sucks. Looking back a decade later, there was nothing I could do to help my ex. Staying was hurting us both. It was important to me to feel like I really tried and didn't just give up on my marriage, but it was ultimately the right decision to end it. You may not really know if you're making the right decision, but you have to care for yourself. If you really can't do it anymore, then trust yourself--you're doing the right thing."

I know I sound harsh, but I'm at my limit with shitty male behaviour and this story is fucking extra.

Also, the number of women in this thread using female pronouns to describe OP's shitsack husband made me double check to make sure I didn't somehow stumble into a libfem shitfest sub. Knock that shit off."

1452,,Veneficca,">Once he becomes a ""stay at home wife/mother"", I know and you know and everyone here knows that you will continue to do 99 percent of the housework and child care while he studies and does his nails.

Often true even of non-TIM males. In my world, my friends' husbands who are SAHDs actually hand the kids off to their mother or MIL to watch, and then their wives have to schedule pediatrician appointments from work, rush home to cook dinner, and do laundry at midnight before getting up at 5 a.m. for their jobs."
1453,,aladyfleeingzombies,"I probably do say sorry too much, and definitely for sure do it more after my wife transitioned. It was like living with a hormonal 12 year old for a bit there, and it was also really annoying because you can tell a hormonal 12 year old (like my mother told *me* and I fully plan on telling my daughter) that she's allowed to have emotions but not allowed to use those emotions as an excuse to treat those around her like dirt. You try to tell your trans wife that and you're apparently not being understanding of what she's going through. Which made me mad, but I ignored my anger and tried to be empathetic.

All of what you said about breastfeeding is true and what we found on our research; wife did not like reading it at *all* and it and my ""lack of support for *her*"" (because, you know, I was 100% concerned about the baby's needs as well as the money) was a hot topic in therapy for too long.

>Can't even be bothered to help you clean up and give you a chance to hang out with your children?

The kids are doing their own age appropriate chores too after dinner; and occasionally she'll give them a hand which actually isn't helpful because I want the kids learning how to do things and that it's part of them being apart of the household so everyone has chores. If I ask, she'll help me dry dishes or something, but I don't think I *should* have to ask you know?

I looked at the ""mypartneristrans"" subreddit, and honestly it feels like there's a lot of very young people there, and/or those in the same place I was two years ago. I don't think they have any valid advice or would offer much support to me; it feels like it would be about my wife's needs and feelings if I did post there. Her needs and feelings are all I've been hearing about since she told me. God, even when I was in labor I had to hear about how it was making her feel. You ladies are biased in my favor, and I think I need that."

1455,,aladyfleeingzombies,"**Replying to the top post again** to say that honestly, I'm seriously considering giving my wife an excuse to go stay in my home state for the two months residency requirement then filing (and talking to a lawyer there.)

It feels dishonest, and like every evil ex wife stereotype, especially with how my home state treats trans people but given the state we live in I don't think courts here are going to look at the facts and put my kids and whats best for them first over my wife.

The kids are all I care about. A little bit me, but honestly, 95% is them. Especially my daughter. She's not a doll for my wife to live vicariously though.

I can't stop thinking about when my daughter is a teenager. What if she doesn't like wearing dresses like I did at that age? Or doesn't want long hair or like getting her nails painted? Will wife make her feel bad for any of that? Like my daughter is less of a girl? And I can't stop picturing my daughter telling me she got her first period, then my wife getting upset daughter didn't tell *her* first, and making our daughter feel a little...not quite guilty because wife won't ever have a period or get pregnant assuming wife lets us talk freely about it instead of hiding it. God, I can't even ask her to pick up some tampons on her way home because it upsets her.

As I keep think about it, I'm realizing I'd feel awkward with my wife sitting there sharing in this moment, just like I would have if my dad had been sitting there with me and my mom when we talked about it.  Uggghhh.

 I hate my job, especially after what they pulled after my daughter was born, and I think my spouse will buy me quitting to go out of state -especially if I promise or at least imply that I'm down with her college plans and will get another job asap after I return. Wife pays daycare for our daughter out of her paycheck so I'm sure she'll be happy to not have to pay that while we're out of state. Son will miss the last six/seven weeks of school but that's okay.

God, this won't be easy. I need to talk to my brother and a lawyer in this state and home state. My sister in law is very pregnant with twins, I'm sure my brother will be okay lying and saying they need me to come help them out and for the kids to come too to keep my nephew company."

1502,,ThisIsNotShakira,"Men do have some milk ducts, and some mammary tissue, and *theoretically* they can produce milk - either due to taking drugs that induce lactation, or because it is a symptom of breast cancer, etc.

However, so little is even really known about the components of women‚Äôs breast milk beyond we know that it has benefits for babies immune systems and so on beyond the colostrum stage (another example of how medicine ignores women for most part), that it is just negligent in my opinion to feed a baby male breast milk with so much unknown about its quality and how it compares to women‚Äôs breast milk. Also, women need to produce a LOT of milk for their babies (and if they can‚Äôt, the baby is at risk of being undernourished if they don‚Äôt switch to formula); I would be surprised if men can do that given they do have a lot less milk ducts and mammary tissue. Can you imagine one of these selfish men, like OPs husband, feeding a baby every 2-3 hours for half an hour or more around the clock? Or dealing with a baby not latching or needing to take an hour each time to get the amount the baby needs then getting an hour before having to go again?

Oh yeah, and then there is the whole they would be passing the drugs they need to induce lactation to the babies. It is all about the men‚Äôs fee fees, and not about the best interests or health of the child.

A woman who was ‚Äústarving‚Äù her baby of milk and nutrients because she could not produce enough milk would be vilified; she is also often vilified if she switches to formula because of the same. But a man who can squeeze out some droplets of milk of uncertain quality - possibly contaminated with drugs - is so brave and stunning!

Women who haven‚Äôt given birth at all or not recently can also breastfeed by inducing lactation, though it can be easier if they have prior experience. Women used to act as milk nurses to other women‚Äôs babies (either as the mothers would not or could not breastfeed, of they were dead from childbirth/died during the child‚Äôs infancy). Sometimes the milk nurses would have to leave their own babies behind or undernourished to do this, or have even lost their own babies, but sometimes they either had no children or had them long ago, and were able to stimulate lactation with suckling, a baby‚Äôs cry, etc. Pre-formula, this was often the only chance a baby with a dead mother, or mother who could not feed, had."

Your partner is self-absorbed and manipulative, and taking advantage of you. You accepted the behavior previously because he was a man doing things in male-socialized ways, and that was OK with you for whatever reason (no judgement).


You're questioning because he's ""a woman"" now. You understand and have a community among women and female culture, but you KNOW women don't actually act that way unless they have other influences driving and changing them. We're socialized into gender roles even before birth much of the time because our sex is factual.    It would be great if we didn't live in a human society where gender roles and expressions were decided based upon sex, but the fact is, it happens.


Your husband didn't lose his past and experiences and outlook when he transitioned, he just changed his perception of himself and demanded everyone else did as well. You're struggling because he's a man who is pretending to be a woman based on his misconceptions and biases, and you're trying to accept his non-truth while still being real to yourself. You know he's still the same person regardless of his new identity, and his identity hasn't changed anything IRL. It's hard to accept, but it doesn't make it less true."

1571,,galit_,"First off, not a lawyer/this is not legal advice. That being said, you need to see a lawyer immediately. If you don't have the money for a lawyer, speak with your brother. This is one of those cases where unfortunately you stand to lose a lot more than what a lawyer might cost to retain. Do not tell anyone except your lawyer and trusted (and I mean *trusted*) family members what you're planning. Money always makes people go a bit crazy, but it gets worse when people have known about the money long enough to make plans for it. With only 6 months until your inheritance vests, you need to get a move on, and fast. Get out to see the lawyer as soon as you can.

There's a lot going on here, so try to carve out a few minutes for yourself tomorrow when you're feeling calm/relaxed (or as calm/relaxed as you're going to be) and jot down absolutely everything you can think of--these added expenditures, your incoming inheritance, whose name the credit card debt is under/whose card was used to rack it up, the timeline of transitioning (has your wife undergone surgery, changed sex markers on official documentation, etc.), what deadlines are impending, etc.--and where you want to go next. Write it all down, then walk away. On Sunday, pick it back up and go over it. Don't look at it when you're angry, because anger can cause you to start fudging facts without noticing. Just keep to facts for the most part.

Your lawyer may or may not need all the details you've included in your post; however, it's always best to walk into a meeting with a lawyer with everything written down on paper so that if you feel rushed or intimidated or overwhelmed etc. you can just refer down to what you've already written. Lawyers *love* organized clients. Organized clients are easy clients. Even if there's an uphill battle ahead of you (and I cannot guess at what will happen next; your lawyer will know far more so listen to them), being an easy client with an uphill battle is much better and easier to deal with than being a difficult client with a slam dunk case.

That being said, you don't need to bow and scrape and run for Ms Congeniality. You just need to show the lawyer that you take the situation seriously. Listen, ask questions when you don't understand something, and make sure you and the lawyer are on the same page before you leave the meeting. Take notes if you need/want to (I always take notes if only to keep my own written record of important meetings, but the lawyer should be taking notes of some kind as well if you forget) but whatever happens, leave knowing what you talked about and what the next steps are or would be (should you retain that lawyer). If you don't understand something, *ask*. Even if it only ends up being a consultation, and you end up with a different lawyer, still try to soak up everything you can.

Ultimately, you don't have much time to shop around, but you do have time to trust your gut. If anything seems off, thank them for their time and move onto the next. Above all else, trust in yourself. Transitioning does not make someone suddenly lose the ability to save money. Transitioning does not make your wife the centre of the universe. You have sacrificed so much for this marriage already. Please don't feel guilty for having the courage and sense to say you won't sacrifice anything more."

I've never experienced this, so take it with a grain of salt (and also perhaps consider approaching r/personalfinance but also take their words with a few grains of salt--these *are* just strangers on the internet, after all) but I think credit card debt might be one of those things that gets split 50/50 in a divorce unless you can extensively prove via receipts and such that it's all your wife/husband's doing.

She did agree pretty fast but that didn't stop her from talking about how it, and I (even indirectly), was invalidating to her. God, even now she's not putting the baby's needs first. I dress the kids in hardy play clothes so they can *play*, and that includes the youngest getting her brother's hand me downs. I'd rather my daughter be able to run around without having to worry about getting dirty and she's cute no matter what she's wearing. Wife does not agree. Wife wants daughter to be dressed up in cute clothing as much as possible, and will waste money buying pretty expensive stuff. Said stuff isn't conductive to playing, let alone playing in mud which is basically daughter's favorite thing to do. I'm pretty sure at one point my daughter has more clothes then I or my son did combined. If I try to talk to wife about it, I get a giggle and a ""I'm just making up for the childhood I never had!"" And if I push it, there's tears or she asks to be alone.  When I clean out daughter's dresser to donate too small stuff or things she won't wear, I always end up setting aside a good portion of the expensive stuff to consign regardless.

1613,,GuineaPigParade,"This is so true and great advice. Like you said, OP, your #1 concern is your kids. It is obvious your spouse's #1 concern is himself. Your trust fund (which is YOURS not his, by the way) can either be used by you to make a better life for yourself and your kids, or it can be wasted and frittered away by your spouse to buy more girly crap and push his way into grabbing YOUR college education for himself (if he is mentally stable enough to actually get through the classes. I would also be wary of him blowing big bucks on tuition, then not putting in the work to pass the classes and graduate).

Since it's obvious your spouse isn't going to put the kids first and is likely going to waste your money, do whatever it takes legal-wise so that you get ALL your money. I'm glad your brother is willing to help with a loan for an attorney. That money is your ticket to improving yourself and your life and therefore improving your kids' lives. This money will also allow you to get away from your spouse, which will also improve your kids lives. It sounds like you are on track to make all this happen, but I just wanted to reinforce the message. Your instincts are excellent. Follow them and don't back down to your spouse.

1646,,cheapsouvenir,"Three interesting points about the study at the NCBI link, which was co-authored by a trans activist:

1 - The father maxed at 227 grams per day, while most women produce around 500 grams per day by the time a baby's 5 days old. Some questions are therefore asked about claims that the pediatrician involved found the adopted baby adequately nourished for six weeks on nothing but the father's lactate.

2 - The man's lactate had not been assessed at the time the study was published so it's not known if it had the same mix of components as milk from new gestational mothers.

3 - The father's choice to ingest estrogen, progesterone, spironolacton, and domperidone had unknown effects on the baby. The FDA does not allow domperidone to be sold in the U.S. because it's caused serious heart problems, including fatal ones. The man in the study was able to obtain it because he lives in Canada where the drug remains on the market.

The Milk Junkies post concerns one case, not two. In it, the father, who also chose to pass domperidone and synthetic hormones to his baby through his lactate, reported that he was unable to produce more than a few droplets at the time of the birth, then found the baby couldn't latch on because his breast tissue and nipple couldn't reach the back of the baby's throat until the baby was older and stronger, and after that, nursed in tandem with his wife because neither of them was producing enough milk for the baby.

Except now she's got a really cute gym bag and exercise outfits and sends me a cute selfie or two of herself while she's there.

She still gets home, eats dinner with us, then hangs out in the kitchen with me and the kids while I do the dishes and clean up. She tells me about her day. I like this part honestly, but I wish she would¬†help¬†because it would get done a lot faster if both of us were doing it.

She won't mow the lawn or do the outside chores any more -it gives her mental distress to do the household activities she did before she transitioned. So now I do all those in addition to most of the inside chores.""

Then OP put the comment you pasted where they talk about how they're still doing their partners laundry, as they always have,as an example of how they're still expecting her to do everything as it was before.

When you first meet a narcissist they approach their target with ""love bombing"" to create join up. They also mirror all the things you love and care about to help the bonding cement. Then they start the ""negging."" *(subtle negative comments to break down your self esteem so you will tolerate their abuse)* It may appear he was not always like this, but this doesn't develop as a personality disorder later in life. It's been there since early childhood. There can be things that cause it to be more intense as apposed to other times, like life's demands, but it's been there, hiding.

TIMs are misogynistic powertrippers, so there's really no use in trying to fight this guy, especially since anyone with any power in the company will take his side.

Interesting how the MAN afforded that courtesy to the MEN, but did not consider that maybe you had trans feelings but weren't ready to come out, and it's not her place to tell you what to wear.

Of course, this has everything to do with the fact that he knows if he complained to the men, they'd tell him to fuck off and might even laugh at him... but he feels that he has power over a woman, that his complaints might succeed with her, and that he won't face pushback for going after her.

This transwoman can feel whatever, but it is wrong to take those feelings and oppress another person.

1930,,FemmeRevolutionnaire,"I see on a pretty consistent basis that transwomen have a hell of a lot more privileges than ‚Äúcis female‚Äù women (a redundant phrase).

I don‚Äôt mean privilege in just the sociological definition (which only means someone does not experience discrimination on a particular axis), but also in the sense that they get an unusual amount of special treatment. They are rarely expected to compromise, acquiesce, or face repercussions for inappropriate behavior. Your story is an all too common example, but there are a lot of egregious ones.

Even other trans activists have said that Halloween is an opportunity for closeted people to safely experiment with their gender identity in public, so it‚Äôs best not to make assumptions about the intentions of cross dressers. How can they be sure you weren‚Äôt trying to explore being a trans man? That doesn‚Äôt mean I personally agree that it‚Äôs transphobic to cross dress for any other reason, but it‚Äôs pretty hypocritical of a trans person to police anyone else‚Äôs gender nonconformity.

Anyway. Your coworker was 100% out of line. Their feelings are their responsibility alone, not yours or anyone else‚Äôs. You did nothing wrong, they were obligated to deal with their own discomfort without taking it out on you. If they couldn‚Äôt handle it like an adult, they should have left.

It‚Äôs not the fault of cis women if a transwoman can‚Äôt pass, and it‚Äôs not our job to make sacrifices because they feel insecure about it. You don‚Äôt owe them anything more than the same basic courtesy you‚Äôd give to any other person.

This applies to any well-adjusted adult in a professional setting, trans or not. Imagine going to HR and saying you want a co-worker to leave a Halloween party because she‚Äôs too attractive and it makes you feel insecure about your looks, or because she was talking about her recent engagement and it made you feel bad because you‚Äôre single. That‚Äôs how delusional and self-centered this person‚Äôs behavior sounds. It‚Äôs just that as a society we‚Äôre all so afraid of the extreme backlash that comes with alleged ‚Äútransphobia‚Äù that we‚Äôre conditioned to indulge their victim complex and constant need for attention."
1931,,flabinella,"Yes it's a very weird world we are living in. And it's getting weirder every day.

Fact 2019: only in very few particular situations people are being expected to foresee any hurt their totally normal actions would cause and they are expected to tweak their behavior.

On the other hand, there are situations where it's totally okay to say or ask things that actually might cause hurt to people but all everyone says is: well get over it.

I will tell you some examples I experienced.

It's totally okay to ask a woman why she doesn't have children. Not only is this a totally personal issue, you might actually hurt someone who is infertile.

It's totally okay to make certain comments about women's bodies. You might never mention her race or the fact that she's overweight. But go ahead and ask her what her shoe size is if she's tall. And if she's slim go ahead and tell her that she should eat something. All perfectly accepted and it happens on a regular basis for me.

so go ahead and invade a woman's privacy, comment on her body and life choices, but don't dare to have a funny costume at an event!"

But first things first - while it is all still fresh in your mind and before you start worrying about hiring a lawyer and before facts get overwhelmed by feelings (which can happen, and it's normal) you need to sit down and write out everything that happened that night, every little detail.

Where did you get dressed for the party? Were you alone or with other people? Describe your costume in *exact* detail (photos would be great.) How did you get to the party? What time did you arrive? Do you remember talking to specific people about your costume or anyone else's costumes? Write it all down. When did you notice the men dressed as female characters? What *exactly* where *they* wearing? How were they acting (i.e. were they just being themselves but in costume, or was 'Harley Quinn' acting like the female character Harley Quinn?)

When did you first notice Sarah was present/when did he arrive? What time was it and what were you doing when Sarah and 'HR' pulled you aside to talk about your costume? Write out the conversation as best as you can remember it. Did anyone else hear the conversation? (If so, ask them to write down what they recall.) What was the tone of the conversation?

>At that point HR told me she can't make me leave, but that Sarah had been crying in the bathroom earlier and that it would mean a lot if I just left for the night.
>
>So I said my goodbyes and left, but I cried in the Uber home.

All the details of this - what was the tone of 'it would mean a lot if you just left for the night?' Did you feel that some negative consequence (other than Sarah's feelings being hurt) would happen to you if you chose to stay? When you said your goodbyes and left, what did you say? Did any of your co-workers know why you were leaving? If they didn't, did they ask why you were leaving early? What did you say? Where was Sarah and ""HR"" while you were saying these goodbyes? What time did you leave? Ask your friends/co-workers who stayed at the party - when did the party end? What time did Sarah leave? How did she seem (mood, etc.) after you left? What time did the men dressed as women leave? **This part is important -** were any work projects, upcoming work social events, or other important work-related conversations you would have been part of had you been able to stay talked about at the party after you left? (This is where damages start applying.)

*Why* did you cry on the way home? Was it just because you had been looking forward to the party, was it because it felt unfair, was it because you hadn't meant to hurt anyone's feelings, was it because you didn't feel you got to state your side of things, was it because the cross-dressing men could stay, was it because you felt accused of transphobia or being disrespectful/hurtful when that wasn't the case, was it because you were worried about the consequences with HR going forward, or some combination of these (or other) things?

Write down everything you remember, times, people, transport modes, everything, and if you have co-operative coworkers, let them help.

Your next step should be to write a simple email to HR. *You need to write a simple wording of events that is basically impossible for them to deny.* Leave out details they could say didn't happen or are exaggerations - just the simple truth.

This is an example, but it might not be right for you (include *only* facts they cannot deny or 'spin,' even better if you can name witnesses who heard the conversation or saw you forced to leave.)

'I am writing re: the events of the evening of (party date), when \[HR person\] told me it was best for me to leave the company party because my costume was upsetting to another co-worker, Sarah, because I was a 'cis woman' dressed as a male character. This happened even after I explained that my costume was simply a favourite character of mine, that I did not intend to hurt anyone's feelings, and after I pointed out that two men at the party were dressed as female characters. Those men were *not* asked to leave. This incident was distressing to me, and I would like to put it on the record. I have testimony from two other co-workers who \[heard the discussion where I was asked to leave, saw me leaving the party in tears, whatever is true.\] If you do not agree with my accounting of this event, I would appreciate a detailed reply indicating exactly where you feel my recollection, and the recollection of my co-workers, is not accurate.""

This will put them on notice that you're thinking lawsuit, so be careful, but make it airtight and basically impossible for them to deny. It should only be a few sentences long (your detailed write-up of the night may be pages long - keep that for *your* lawyer, don't show it to HR.)

Don't start looking for a lawyer until you have written out every detail you remember, quietly enquired if any co-workers can vouch for any of what you're saying occurred (I mean *any* of it - even if someone just remembers you left suddenly and unexpectedly, that's good, ask them to write down what they remember.) Then once you have your written statement, any corroborating statements, and a response from HR to your undeniable facts, go find that lawyer and *please* crucify your employer, because what happened to you is not okay. (I might think differently if the men in 'cross-dress' were also asked to leave, but they weren't? That's some bullshit right there.)"
2025,,marilynspolitics,ACLU and HRC are both very pro-trans. Try find representation that will treat you fairly.
2026,,TAgurl,"Yes, yes, yes! Legal advice pronto!

My mind raged upon reading this account. I immediately started rationalising the situation with regards to HR work policies for clothing etc. I know it‚Äôs confronting to be put on the spot in this scenario, but unless HR can show definitive documentation that clearly outlines where OP had contravened any said policy, it was completely unacceptable to suggest, even in an ‚Äòunofficial‚Äô capacity (and regardless of how oh, so politely it was couched) that she leave the party.

In this instance OP, YOU were clearly singled out and discriminated against.

Be clear when recounting the reason they gave you for suggesting you leave. What language did they use and how did they use it? Was the reasoning they gave sound, with regards to your behaviour? The obvious answer is no.

They kicked you out just to appease someone else‚Äôs sensibilities - someone you had zero direct contact with that night. Nobody else found your costume offensive up to that point, so don‚Äôt let them pull that card on you either.

Remember OP to also highlight that you immediately tried to calmly resolve this issue and brought to their attention the blatant discrimination between your being asked to leave, and the verbal response you were given for why the cross-dressing men didn‚Äôt have to.

Was it even acceptable for a representative of HR to approach you in this casual manner? What‚Äôs the policy for this? It was essentially an ambush, for which you had zero time to prepare for, let alone accept.

Good luck!"
2027,,TrueIsntSafe,"Seconding the stay away from the ACLU opinion. They have fully drunk the trans Kool-Aid.

Step 1 is to document everything. OP should start a folder in her home. For each incident, jot down names, dates, places, witnesses, people she talked to after the fact, and copies of any key documents. Now that the TIM has had a taste of exercising shame and ostracism powers over a female coworker and HR has backed him up on it, the crybullying is going to ramp up.

It won't necessarily be aimed at OP again, and probably not against 67-year-old Marie. But woe to McKenzie who sits next to the TIM and has the temerity to be pregnant in his presence, or Molly who needs extra accommodation for her endometriosis, or Megan who dares tell her work besties about her PCOS or TTC struggles.

Step 2 is for OP to pull out her employee handbook. Familiarize herself with company policy on reporting a hostile work environment incident. Even though the party wasn't typical 9-5 work, it's still corporate enough.

Step 3 is to make some tough choices about whether and how to actually report.

If OP is going for a lawyer, she should look for a local plaintiff's employment discrimination lawyer. If she's in the US, it may be a little early to find a lawyer who will take the case on a no-money-up-front contingent fee, but it might be worth her time to seek an initial consultation on the hostile work environment. Just depends on how hungry the local sharks are.

If OP can't find a lawyer at this early phase - or she just doesn't want to - she needs to decide whether she wants to risk an internal corporate complaint. On the one hand, doing this promptly and by the book makes it harder for them to undermine her timing and motives if it ever does get to litigation. On the other, only OP has a sense of what kind of retaliation is likely to blowback on her for being 'difficult'.

In any event, OP should probably leave the GC/QT/TRA politics out of it. Unless her lawyer tells her otherwise, continue to play along with the TIM's pronouns, etc. For now, this is just about a double standard for male and female staff, and being singled out as 'inappropriate' with inadequate advance warning or justification."

Therefore, assuming you're cis & have cis privilege, goes against gender ideology.... yet it happens all the time because rampant hypocrisy thrives in this movement.

Gender pertains to roles, stereotypes, & expectations, that are nothing but a social construct, enforced by a patriarchal society. Gender has been a powerful tool used to oppress women -- by claiming we are ""cis"", they are claiming we are not only walking stereotypes, but that we willingly identify with our oppression... not very progressive is it?

That's why gender identity is harmful. For it to exist, they expect a portion of people to fit into this narrow definition of what a man or woman is. We know no one does, so going by gender logic, everyone should technically be ""non binary"" or ""trans"", because no one is a walking stereotype.

If everyone could qualify as having a different ""gender identity"" from their sex, then it shows why the whole concept is flawed. They choose to believe in these regressive sexist stereotypes, & tell people their body must be wrong, rather than seeing the problem is with having that mentality in the first place.

ETA: someone else here made a beautiful comment the other day. They said something like: 50 years ago, if a boy wanted to wear a dress, he was told no, because boys can't wear dresses. Now, if a boy wants to wear a dress, he's told yes, but also told he must be a girl, because boys still can't wear dresses."

EXACTLY!

The logical solution would be to send the TiM home. If he's so delicate that something as simple as a woman dressing up as a male Batman villain causes him to run screaming to HR and cry ""DYSPHORIA!!"", than he's clearly too sensitive for Halloween.

&#x200B;

Also, as others have pointed out, where does this end? If this TiM can command HR to send a woman home for wearing a tuxedo to a party (without the makeup, most TwoFace costumes are just normal tuxedos), can he also send one home during a normal workday because she wore a ""masculine"" pantsuit to the office and it triggered him? What if a very butch woman comes to work there and seeing her go about her day in masculine clothes, no makeup, and short hair causes him to have a breakdown? Will HR then be compelled to tell the butch woman she's required to wear skirts and makeup to the office because it would make the trans person less sad? It's INSANE to allow one person to have this much power over their co-workers.

&#x200B;

I can't help feeling just a little sorry for the HR rep in this story. I imagine HR was in a bind because, in this climate, if you say ""no"" to a transgender person (especially a TiM) or imply that they might be over reacting to something silly (like a goddam Halloween costume) you'll likely be in for a PR nightmare that could destroy your business.

Then print it out, seal it in an envelope, mail it to yourself, and after you receive it in the mail keep it sealed - the postmark is your proof of when you wrote it (this is a common thing in copyright cases, it works just as well for 'witness testimony') You can unseal it in court or arbitration if it comes to that.

Even if the case is successful, all an employer needs to do is axe any ""woman"" dress codes & make a policy,  (for ex) that all employees need to wear neutral colored pants & a button up.

(it‚Äôs illegal to record without permission in differing jurisdictions). Generally, the burden of proof will always fall on to you if there is no other evidence.

Doing so, I‚Äôve had decisions made against me/my actions from years past overturned or abolished, and this includes fines or supposed multiple debts (which were proved to be incorrect). I could do this only because I keep detailed records.

This may seem extreme, but how many times for instance, have people been verbally told something by a utility company only to receive a bill where you‚Äôve been charged for something outside of what you thought were agreed terms. If you contact them and challenge them on this, they typically claim ignorance or error, so bad luck for you.

2212,,muffinsrising,"Wow this was a ride. When I was searching for this article I came across [a similar one posted to reddit](http://np.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/6luvs1/man_who_identifies_as_6year_old_dominates/) about a man dominating a kids crossfit class. One of the comments referred to the article saying that the man 'didn't identify' as someone who was taking growth hormones, and mentioned that this should be a standard response to a PED's accusation.

&#x200B;

I [googled PED](https://www.floelite.com/articles/6225210-emily-abbott-fails-ped-test-is-barred-from-crossfit-games) because I didn't know what it stood for: Performance-Enhancing Drug test. That article lists women who have been sanctioned for failing the test. 2nd on the list is a woman banned for using ""clomiphene - selective estrogen receptor modulator"".

&#x200B;

[Clomiphene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomifene) is primarily prescribed to treat female infertility by stimulating ovulation (for example, women with PCOS). It stimulates GnRH release, which upregulates sex hormone production and inhibits receptors for estrogen in the brain that would turn 'off' the signal. As a result, the hypothalamus perceives the body to have low estrogen, and upregulates gonadotropin (FSH and LH) production. These stimulate the ovaries to produce more estrogen. As ovary follicles develop they in turn produce more estrogen. It works for infertility because high estrogen is needed at that phase of the cycle to get a follicle to rupture for ovulation.

&#x200B;

Clomiphene is banned by the [World Anti-Doping Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_drugs_banned_by_WADA). So females can't use drugs to increase their estrogen production as a treatment for PCOS and infertility, but TiMs can pop all the estrogen that pleases them without regulation to treat their genderfeels. Women aren't allowed to mess with their natural estrogen hormone levels, not even when they have a serious medical condition... so much for ""transwomen are women""."

 However, in the plasma products industry, male plasma has historically been more highly sought after and valued because it is perceived as a less ‚Äòrisky‚Äô product than plasma from women.

Two examples demonstrate how gender operates as an organising principle in blood and plasma processing.

First, in the UK since 2003, a policy of ‚Äòmale donor preference‚Äô has been adopted meaning that all women's plasma obtained through blood donation is usually discarded (i.e. unless there is a shortage of male plasma) because it is associated with a potentially higher incidence of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) attributed to high levels of antibodies following pregnancy.

The reproductive potential of women's bodies impacts on how they are understood as blood and plasma donors: women are identified as potentially being or having been pregnant at the point of donation and thus at risk of adversely affecting the recipients of their donated plasma. Women are thus constructed as more risky bodies and the maternal body as representing a threat to blood and plasma product safety"

2253,,heidischallenge,I thought TRALI is only from multiparous women?
2254,,4eyedPurplePPLeater,"No,  I think they are finding it in any woman who's been pregnant at all, no need for even birth. I might be wrong, but I swear that's what they've found out.     "
