I hate misogynists so much. I hate how far they'll go to disparage women and justify their subordination. And I hate how people who claim to want to be women are eagerly reinforcing those same stereotypes used to undermine and hurt actual women.

30,iRainbowsaur,"I don't think they're basing it on gender stereotypes (I don't think many millennials/current gen people post anime memes likely to actually belittle a womans smarts to a mans)

 I mean the way I interprate the meme is like they're much more likely to be getting off to the idea they are doing the dumb girl anime trait which tends to be ""cute"" so it makes them feel cute. So if anything alot of stuff they say can be traced back to anime stereotypes lol, the amount of woman in here right now seething to the bone are clearly thinking too deep about this holy damn."

In a recent hontrapoints video he said (and I'm paraphrasing through a quote I heard elsewhere because I don't make a habit of watching psuedointellectuals in fetish gear) if you can't handle being a man you should throw in the towel and become a woman. This quote really highlights the mindset that he and a lot of transcels have, that becoming a woman is giving up. He let the mask slip there for a moment and let it be known that he views being a man as taking an active role and being a woman is a passive role after they ""give up"". These people have a really warped world view, it's a shame that they have such a bully pulpit in academia where they can preach this nonsense."
70,Nebel01,"My mother was a soldier( i wrote about her being a sharpshooter.)but she had to leave the army when she got pregnant, had to take the entire blame and forced to stay mute about the whole deal so to not damage the dude and the army reputation.She often mention how she miss her days in the army, also im 99% sure it was rape to boot.

Ended up trying to find an explanation to all this mess so she turned to religion. While studying theology  she ended up in a relationship with an abusive drughead( LUL this is redundant dont you think?).Not only didnt she find answer to her questions but new one started to sprout out.Left the asshole and ended up in a small village working as a barmaid (where she found my dad, an adorable dork of a gentle giant of a lumberjack ( i love my dad, he is what men should strive to be, honest, hardworker, full of love for other and gentle with everyone, especially kids and animals)). when she finally finished her theology master degree she started to work as a pastoral  agent, teaching religions to kids. Lost her post because priests are dickwad narcissist male with power trips

74,69-XXX,"Theyre not wrong about this though.  Theyre actually pointing out a legitimate problem.  The notion of Progress has been so glorified, without any hard set definitions, that once something gets labelled as a Progressive cause, theres really no going back amongst that political faction.  They are not going to back down on this Trans thing, ever.  The majority of people who consider themselves Progressive are going to continue to support it, and most of those people will never have to deal with the ramifications.  For those of us who do support ""progressive"" things like basic human rights, but not this, we have lost.  I'm sorry to say, the game is over.  The Trans agenda has inserted itself so fully into the center of ""progressive"" politics that it is inextricable and unquestionable.  There is no more ""fixing this from within"", only a splintering of factions.  The fact that rightwing people also worry about this trans thing is a sign of that.  Youre both looking at the sames garbage fire, appalled for different reasons, but the fire still burns.  The best course is to just disengage from society until this whole thing collapses in in itself, and to try to rebuild something sane of the Left from the ashes, but for now trying to speak out in anything but GC or RW spaces is going to be futile and socially suicidal.  We are in this for the long haul.  Im not saying to team up with politics you hate, Im saying Im stepping back and watching society burn from a distance."

79,killthenerds,Can you try to find the source for that paraphrase?
80,gendercritfem,"""progressive"" causes lose ground all the time, even ones that are actually progressive.

In the past several decades, we've lost ground in union rights, abortion rights, voting rights for ethnic minorities, and immigration rights. The president is Donald J. Trump. ""Progressivism"" isn't some magic word that guarantees success.

And I think the rot can be excised, there's even historical precedent! This isn't the first time that a movement for oppression has latched onto a progressive cause. In the first wave of feminism, there were lots of anti-immigrant bigots who managed to shoehorn their agenda into the legitimate suffrage movement. In the 2000s, neocons tried to claim that the bloody invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan were ""feminist"" projects designed to liberate women. Both of these were accepted as ""progressive"" in their time, but are not viewed as such today. The trans movement is similar to these in that it claims to be an extension of a genuine progressive cause (LGB rights), while only using it as an excuse to oppress and endanger women. I have faith that people will eventually recognize the mistake that was made here, as they have in the past."
81,gendercritfem,"I mean, you made [this lovely post](https://www.reddit.com/r/smuggies/comments/d50jjq/play_stupid_games_win_stupid_prizes/f0jsp6r/) calling women who date black men ""coal burners"", you post on /r/hateblackpeople, you're a genuinely racist piece of garbage.

85,69-XXX,"Oh im certainly not meaning to say that progressive movements dont lose ground.  In fact I believe that TRAs being given the reins of Progressive movements is going to fuck us all.  What I meant was that now given that this has become THE cause de jour of those with the power to dictate what ""Progress"" means, there is no going back.  They are in charge of the ""progressive movement"" now and I dont think they will ever allow trans shit to be taken off the table.  It would take a political coup of sorts, and would require new organizations - the trans will not be excised from the posts they were awarded.  Theyre willing to use Human Rights Courts to get their balls fondled, imagine what theyll do when threatened with political displacement.  We put a monkey in the drivers seat and we cant get it out now.  But forming ""new movements"" means a splintering of effort and loss of effectiveness.  I dont think there is a good answer to this problem.  I think the things that could be done to fix this would be unpalatable to everyone involved, and will never happen.  I don't think we'll ever see an alliance of ""right and left"" on this, which is what it would take to have the required political weight.  So we fracture.  Factions will form, each weaker than the previous.  I dont think this gets fixed short of dramatic change in planetary/societal conditions, ie a collapse of industrial civilization.  Until then, catgirls have the monopoly on ""our"" voices, be that women or progressives or minorities or pro-healthcare folks.  It doesn't look good.  They are not going to relinquish power, and lets be real, they will never be asked to."

91,gendercritfem,"Progressivism is good, actually. Advances in rights for women, ethnic minorities, LGB people, the poor, and the disabled have all been great things.

147,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"> I honestly don't understand this fake period BS that TiMs spout off about. 

Have you ever seen the TV show ""Dexter?""

Honestly, it's a fairly accurate representation of how psychopaths think. As Dexter goes about his life, he's always asking himself *""how would a normal person react in this situation?""* and Dexter is constantly attempting to mimic human emotion, when the truth is that he's just a blank automaton. Being a psychopath is very much like being a robot. Mark Zuckerberg is an obvious example, he's just a complete robot. *""The Social Network""* did a wonderful job of capturing that.

Now, understanding all of that, *what if you were a psychopath who was attempting to pass as a woman?* You would do all the things that you've seen women do. And that's what a lot of these TiMs are mimicking; they're acting out the things that they've seen their sisters do, or their mothers do. It's the reason they have this weird disconnect from human morality. No sane woman would throw a pool party with topless twelve year olds, but a male psychopath would."

162,merewautt,"A lot of doctors will actually argue that it's *healthier* long term to skip periods with birth control. Every period the lining is shed and regrown and *any* biology mechanism that involves injury or growing new tissue ups the life long risk for cancer. Because every new cell formed in the body has the possibly of malfunctioning, going rogue and multiplying rapidly. Which is the definition of a cancerous cell.

Women in the past were pregnant much more often during their lifetime, and many doctors think the modern woman may be at higher risk for ovarian cancer due to hundreds of more periods during their reproductive years. So many of them *recommend* skipping periods if your birth control allows it.

Hormonal birth control has it own issues for a lot of women, but if you're already using it successfully without terrible side effects, don't listen to the scare tactics telling you to take the sugar week and get your period if you don't get any peace of mind out of it. *A lot* of researchers think it lowers your lifetime risk for ovarian cancer."
163,GCchick,"I'm the same. I enjoy my periods even when they're painful because it connects me to my body and... without wanting to sounds to newagey, it connects me to nature. I also feel closer to women, past present and future. There's something really beautiful about periods. I could never relate to the women that said they hated them, or wish they didn't have any. I know that my best friend also feels the same as me, so we're not alone!"

It wasn't just a side effect that they didn't' bother to fix either, it was a deliberate addition. A deliberate addition of medically unnecessary pain and bleeding. It was either included as an attempt to avoid freaking out Catholics (who would not appreciate the lifting of ""Eve's curse""), or because the people who invented it thought that women wouldn't be able to wrap their tiny little lady brains around the idea of something that temporarily makes you infertile also temporarily stopping your period, depending on what source you believe."

> This portion of my decision addresses Ms. Yaniv’s complaints against Blue Heaven Beauty Lounge and Ms. Benipal, Ms. DaSilva, Ms. Tran, Ms. Dulay, and Merle Norman. In each of these cases, the Respondents advertised the service of “brazilian waxing”, and it was this service which Ms. Yaniv attempted to book. These cases raise two common issues at the outset: (1) what service was Ms. Yaniv requesting, and (2) does this service constitute a brazilian wax, such that it is one the Respondents were customarily providing to the public.  In this section, I address each of these issues in turn, and then go on to apply my findings to each individual complaint.    
>  
>9 A.The service Ms. Yaniv was requesting Ms. Yaniv does not dispute that she was requesting that these Respondents wax her genitals. In this unique context, her genitals were therefore relevant to her complaints – specifically to the question of whether the Respondents customarily provided the type of genital waxing that she was requesting. Throughout the hearing, however, Ms. Yaniv refused to answer questions about her genitals and argued that such questions were inappropriate. Given her representation to various Respondents that she had “male parts”, has not “gone through surgery”, and “was born a man now I’m a woman”, the hearings initially proceeded on the understanding that she has a penis and scrotum, and that she was therefore requesting waxing of the scrotum. However, under cross examination she was evasive on the issue, referring to “whatever is down there”. In the Blue Heaven hearing on July 4, she insinuated that she may be intersex but refused to say whether she was. Asked to explain what she meant when she told Ms. Benipal she had “male parts”, she testified simply “I mean male parts”.  On July 17, in the hearing against Ms. DaSilva, Ms. Yaniv testified that she had “male genitals”. Moments later, she testified, for the first time, that she is intersex. She said again that she had “male parts” and then added that she had “other stuff”, though she initially refused to say whether that included a vulva. She denied, for the first time, that she had asked Ms. DaSilva to wax a scrotum. Ms. Yaniv refused to answer questions put to her by Ms. DaSilva’s counsel, and so I intervened:   
>  
>Tribunal:   Ms. Yaniv, it’s relevant to this complaint. ... The question is, what were you asking Ms. DaSilva to wax?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  I was asking for a female genital waxing wax .... A brazilian wax.   
>  
>Tribunal:  ... Forget brazilian, brozilian, male, female, whatever – what body part were you asking her to ask?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  The genitals, the genital region.   
>  
>Tribunal:  Their defence hinges on a defence that they, that she, is not comfortable waxing a scrotum. So are you talking about a scrotum, or are you talking about a vulva, or are you talking about both?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  The second one.   
>  
>Tribunal:  Vulva?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  Yes.   
>  
>Tribunal:  ... You’re saying you were asking her to wax a vulva? Ms. Yaniv:   
>  
> Yes. ... I’m not gonna say whether I have the whole thing. I’ll say it exists.  
>  
> At this point, Mr. Cameron asked Ms. Yaniv to submit to an independent medical examination to verify her genitals. I refused to make such an order, on the basis that it was unduly intrusive and disproportionate to the issues at stake.  I am satisfied, based on Ms. Yaniv’s representations to the Respondents that she has “male parts”, “used to be a boy”, and has not “gone through surgery yet”, as well as her evidence in these hearings that she has “male parts”, that Ms. Yaniv was seeking to have hair removed from a scrotum. Whether or not she may also have a vulva is not ultimately determinative of any issue in this complaint and so I do not need to engage further with that question"

> However, I find that Ms. Yaniv’s predominant motive in filing her waxing complaints is not to prevent or remedy alleged discrimination, but to target small businesses for personal financial gain. In many of these complaints, she is also **motivated to punish racialized and immigrant women based on her perception that certain ethnic groups, namely South Asian and Asian communities, are “taking over”** and advancing an agenda hostile to the interests of LGBTQ+ people. These motives are not consistent with the Code’s purposes, and in particular its purpose of promoting a climate of understanding and mutual respect, where all are equal in dignity and rights: s.

Rather, I find that the only reason that Ms. DaSilva cancelled the appointment was because she found Ms. Yaniv’s behaviour troubling and deceptive – which it was. ""

What if he was targeting white women who don’t belong to religious organizations? What if he was offering to donate any money awarded him to charity? Would the court still have ruled this way?

I think even in the trans community that’s been discussed to the point of death. 

Misogyny and the objectification of women lends to TIFs passing, too. People see short hair/pants and assume man; if you’re not performing femininity you must be a dude. When I cut my hair into a pixie last year, I definitely felt that shift."

* 78.4% of 584 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual acknowledged at least one lifetime incidence of autogynephilic arousal, compared to just 20% of 589 MtF subjects classified as homosexual.

* In four of the five studies (Lawrence (2005) excluded) reporting MtF subjects' history of transvestic fetishism, 73% of 382 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual reported at least one lifetime episode of transvestic fetishism, compared to just 20% of 577 MtF subjects classified as homosexual.

* In Lawrence's (2005) study of of 232 MtF transsexuals patients who underwent SRS, 90% of 202 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual reported at least one lifetime episode of autogynephilic arousal, with median and modal frequencies of hundreds of episodes or more. Of the 12 MtF subjects classified as homosexual, only 3 (25%) reported at least on episode one lifetime episode of autogynephilic arousal, and ""the median and modal number of episodes homosexual participants reported were both never.""

* In Nuttbrock's et al. (2011) study, 40% of the exclusively homosexual MtF group began HRT during adolescence, compared to just 1% of the heterosexual MtF group and 14% of the bisexual MtF group. Thus validating Blanchard's observation that homosexual MtF transsexuals present for clinical assessment at a significantly younger age than non-homosexual MtF transsexuals. Furthermore, 82% of exclusively gynephilic MtF subjects reported a history of transvestic fetishism, compared to just 14% of MtF subjects who had started HRT during adolescence."

Views on women aren't a marker for who's female. By that logic, right-wing/anti-feminist non-trans women aren't women.

>The only difference is that they are not sexually attracted to women.

...And not fetishistic in their feelings toward men. And not fetishistic toward women. Which means that if transsexuality is not biologically real, ""homosexual TiMs"" would have entirely different reasons for transitioning.

494,DistantGlimmer,"First, You are not ""assigned a gender at birth."" You are born with sexual characteristics which determine your sex.  Changing your gender expression wouldn't require surgery or HRT. If you are doing that you are trying to change your *sex* [even though humans can't actually do that, most transpeople falsely believe that they can change sex.].

Birds are hatched, implying the opposite sex is equivalent to unintelligent animals is very disrespectful, do you really need that explained to you in such detail?

501,Mentalink,"Ah yes, you got us, we are all very misogynistic and when we talk about eggs we definitely just mean that women are as dumb as birds. That's 100% what's going on here, even though we actually use the hatching analogy for every gender including trans men and non-binary people, and not just trans women, but yeah! Totally. We love to insult ourselves.

Seriously, are you really that daft? Jesus Christ. And you people say we're the ones getting offended for no reason. 

And about your first point, it's missing mine entirely, and not worth responding to; you went on this rant about how changing sex and gender aren't the same thing even though I never implied that they were. All I said is that the ""egg"" analogy applies to gender identity and not to sex change.

Also, you know it's not only birds who lay eggs right? Not that it matters cause either way it's just an analogy but the mental gymnastics you did to be offended by it impress me."
502,livipup,"That analogy with birds is a bit of a stretch. And, well, sex is complicated. There are things scientifically recognized as primary sexual characteristics which can naturally change throughout a person's lifetime or are even expected to. It's also possible to be born with these primary sexual characteristics mismatched. There's even research suggesting that trans people are neurologically intersex. I think the egg idea is a bit weird, but I don't believe that it reflects anyone's views of non-trans people at all."

506,FlatCommunication1,">So you mean the percent of loud agp and loud HsTs is the same?

Yes. IME HSTS get even more visibility.  Within trans activism, they collaborate, too: Laverne Cox raised money for an imprisoned child killer rapist. Calpernia Addams and Lynn Conway. Among many examples. outside of trans activism,[they still flip out over pronouns, want children transed, claim they're the only ""true women"", can be awful to women and gay men.](https://i.imgur.com/U25SAN1.png) (that includes those who associate themselves with GC feminists)."
507,livipup,"I've met a lot of lesbians who are open to dating trans women. Maybe it's just a younger generation thing, can't say for sure. Some are only open to post-op trans women but others are open to both even if they aren't open to cisgender men."
508,commupissed,You're reaching.
509,livipup,"I can't imagine there are too many people on Reddit who are qualified to decide if a peer-reviewed study is valid or not and who also care what a small percentage of the population does with their bodies, so I think we just have to trust scientists when so many of them start saying the same thing. Unless maybe there are just as many or more saying something different. The APA and WHO both seem to have accepted that it's at least not a part of someone's sexuality and they're generally pretty trustworthy. I don't agree with everything they claim, but I do assume they know better than I do."
510,Nebel01,"Wth, this is sickening. Yeah i can see where you are coming from, and im notfor any of this. Pronouns shit go against my own belief of using the pronouns you see ( calling somebody that look like a man he, woman she ) unless you are aware of his/her trans status and in that case you should use the pronouns that adhere to your own beliefs, transing at all should be a real last resort if other therapy dont work, we are obviously not real women , just fascimile at the best, and i dislike being awful to anyone, women and gay men(considering i am a gay man to boot)  can be amazing peoples or pieces of trash like anyone else."
511,TrueJacksonVP,"These women are likely bi or pan if they are attracted to pre-op penis in any way, shape, or form. 

This is the problem we as lesbians are currently facing. Lesbians cannot find a penis attractive, that’s *why* we’re lesbians. Otherwise we’d likely be open to dating men or pre-op transwomen. We’d also be *bisexual* for it. 

The girls claiming “I’m a lesbian and *I* like girl dick, so all you other lesbians are being close minded and transphobic” are a huge part of the problem right now. I as a lesbian *cannot* force myself to like penises and their functions. They psychically turn me off. I don’t even enjoy penetration. Yet I’ve been told that I’m transphobic and close minded for not being open to girl penis. If a straight male said this to me, it’d be considered homophobic. No one would *ever* demand a gay man accept their vagina. Genitalia is an important part of sexuality and for some is *the* most important part. Transbians have no right to demand penis acceptance from an established group of women who hate penis. Most of the transbians I’ve encountered have no desire for bottom surgery and still like their penis. But they rarely fuck each other — which really tells you all you need to know. 

Right now a lot of bisexuals and straight women are appropriating lesbian culture and identity because it’s somehow “cooler” or “easier” to just cut and dry state they’re a lesbian than explain the intricacies of their own sexuality. I understand why they might, but this in turn damages “actual” lesbians who are not afforded the same leniencies in terms of our rigid sexualities. If you’re a lesbian who likes penis, you’re not a lesbian haha. And people get really angry when you gatekeep their identity (even though they do not fit the “requirements” for the identity they’ve chosen). They then damage the perception of lesbians because of attitudes like “well she *was* a lesbian and now she’s dating Rob, so I guess they all secretly want the D”. We don’t. 


Sorry for the novel and that’s not at all directly at you, it’s just extremely frustrating to be a cis lesbian in this day and age. It was easier a decade ago — which is mind blowing. As gay men and trans folk progress, lesbian identity had become watered down and appropriated by men with fetishes, entitled/upset transwomen, and bisexuals who don’t realize the damage they’re doing by claiming to be a lesbian while harboring attraction towards dick."
512,corny_reptile,">Save

You are moving the goal posts. The claim was that primary sex characteristics naturally change and trans people are ""neurologically intersex."" I don't think the WHO and APA are saying anything of the sort. Sure a penis or a vulva will change with puberty but they don't naturally change from one to the other! That's absurd."

She NEVER asked him what his penis is until when she was about 4 ish and saw her little cousin naked and saw he had one too, obviously, being a sane person we simply told her that boys have a penis.  As she got older we got her a book about bodies that explains anatomy and sex and periods in child friendly terms (she hides it under her bed but approaches me occasionally to ask for clarification).

This man should tell his child the truth. He’s a male and so he has a penis. If his dysphoria isn’t bad enough that he’s able to keep and use his penis to impregnate his wife surely he can tell his child what a penis is and what it’s used for?

625,applestrudelterf,"I took it up mean the kid has seen ‘mummy’s’ willy, probably at bath time or something, and asked what it was, which is why they need to find a different word other than penis etc. But you’re right, they will have to teach the kid about the birds and the bees at some point, In which case it’s either abusive or absolutely hilarious because the kid will either be hopelessly confused, OR, they’ll recognise straight away that the penis in the educational book they just read looks *exactly* like ‘mummy’s girldick’ and they’ll keep questioning and questioning until they suss this shit out for themselves and peak trans themselves... the more I think about it the more I think the latter could actually happen since kids are notorious for cutting straight past the bulls hit and seeing clearly where adults are clouded by ideology and  social graces. It was after all a child that pointed out the emperors new clothes - and I know it’s only fiction, but there is a reason it was a child and it’s because they are good at this sort of thing."

642,throwaway275445,All countries used to require surgery. In the UK to get a gender recognition cert you still have to be looking into surgery but people just do that to con the panel then once they have the GRC they forget all about it and just boost online about being a legal women with a dick.

Or at least if there should be a minimum latency period, like you can’t raise a kid until after 10 years minimum since you legally became trans. That way the craziness might be somewhat gone.

This topic wouldn’t go over well at all,  but if you KNOW a group has a very high chance of being mentally ill one way or another, wouldn’t it be prudent to perhaps not let them freely be in control of kids?"

668,Comfycodone,"Theres a lot of problems with even attempting to bring something like this to a panel. One such problem is the fact that you dont have to be trans to be mentally unstable and have kids. Plenty of GC people are too mentally unstable to raise children, but they have children anyway. Should we take away the children from these people as well? If so, then it's not really a debate on trans people, but mentally unstable people in general. But then that leads to the problem of ""assuming"" that trans people are mentally unstable, which is not a hot topic for discussion in the PC world we live in. Because of this, people just wont hear it. They'll turn their ears off to it or scream and yell until the topic is removed from discussion. 

But even if we were able to get this discussion into the public forum, they would want proof that a child raised in a trans household is at risk of becoming mentally ill. This leads to even more problems, because even if that child ends up becoming trans, the trans community will just say ""THEY WERE BORN THAT WAY ITS NOT THE PARENTS FAULT"" or if they do become mentally ill then it's because ""SOCIETY BULLIED THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR TRANS PARENTS"". They will find a way to draw the narrative to represent their own agenda, and the faceless masses will agree with them so they dont appear to be oppressive shitlords. 

Honestly, it's just not worth the fuss. It's for the best that we quietly seethe to ourselves and circlejerk our distaste for the mental illness known as transgenderism amongst ourselves."

670,arnaq,Frankly I am all about fetish discrimination. People with creepy sexual fetishes that they expose on other members of society outside of their bedrooms and TRULY consenting partners (not the whole “my husband likes this thing and it creeps me out but I do it anyway because marriage) should be evaluated before children are allowed in their care. These parents are parenting a toddler and literally going to tell the kid that dad excuse me “mom” has a “big clit”? Are you fucking kidding me?
671,Ergative_Absolutive,"Disagree. I know a FtM/woman couple who are raising a kid and, as far as I can tell, doing a good job of it.

The term ""genderqueer"" was also just synonymous for ""gender neutral"" or ""gender nonconforming"", none of which are modifiers of male and female genders and not used as its own 3rd+ gender until tumblr.

Nonbinary being used as its own gender separate from male and female is entirely a tumblr thing too. Its origin is mostly used by tumblrinas who think that not liking pink and femininity makes them the ultimate #notlikeothergirls, which they call nonbinary.

That's normal, but for a child to randomly ask what moms genitals are without a reason like your example, and what they're used for, at two years old means they already heard this in conversation before or were coached. No 2 year old just walks up and randomly asks about someone else's genitals and their use without getting the idea from an adult or some type of media.

720,applestrudelterf,"I’m sorry but that’s a really weird conclusion to come to. If a child sees a body part on their parent - especially when it’s one they haven’t got themselves - it would be quite natural to ask what it is, especially if, as seems to be the case here, they know the names of all the other body parts but their parents have avoided mentioning one in particular.

My theory is that men are like dogs. Will literally fuck anything. Women act as 'calmers' in straight relationships. They temper the more wild and crazy aspects of male sexuality.

Men are dogs. Gay men are dogs with no leash. And  I include trans people in this. Trans 'women' mostly seem to go with other trans 'women' which basically means its two gay men. So the 'extreme' aspect comes into play again. There is a distinct lack of feminine energies involved. Couple this with how porn tends towards making people go slowly more and more extreme in order to hit the same 'high'. And well. It can be a recipe for disaster."

The US population is somewhere around 329,000,000. Thus far in 2019, 18 trans people have been murdered. If we estimate the trans population at .6%, that would mean there are approximately 1.9 millions trans ppl in the US.1219📷

Out of those 1.9 million, 18 have been murdered in 2019. That's about 1 victim for every 105,000 trans people. In 2016, approximately 12.2 women out of every 100,000 women were victims of homicide, and that was up from 10.2 in 2015. I am sorry for anyone who dies a violent...1829📷

Or, to show any lurking TiMs there might be another explanation for their 'dysphoria', AGP/porn addiction, while all the gender clinics and TRAs shove them on the express train towards transitioning so maybe they reevaluate before doing something irreversible.

I think we have to admit that the project of this sub fundamentally goes against Reddit's core beliefs, and they will be looking for any reason to ban us. While I agree we shouldn't hand them that reason, we shouldn't be too zealous in our moderation either, as people here express frustration or disgust they are not able to express irl.

When you watch porn, there's a good chance you are watching someone being raped."
988,arealbigboss,"They’re porn addicts who mostly have a complete lack of real sexual experience, it’s what drives their AGP. If these people were to lay off porn, socialize more, and maybe find partners/be more honest about their sexuality they’d never even think about being trans."

I find it very easy to tell the difference most of the time, and I imagine a lot of other women do too. But men seem to find it very challenging.

for this reason, I would guess that most content on r/menwritingwomen is submitted by women. 

It would be very interesting to see a study where the authors asked people to guess what gender random posts were written by, and see if women are more likely to correctly guess posts written by other women, and vice versa for men given posts written by other men."

Nobody wants to hear about how hard you are, sir.

>Watching someone else have and be everything you want?

By definition, this is untrue. You don't want what she has and is, by definition you cannot know what she has and is because you are a male who has never experienced womanhood for a day in his life. What you want is what you fantasize about her having and being.

>Even her name is freaking perfect and it would even suit me too.

It would not. You are not who you wish to be, only who you are.

You are a heterosexual man in a first world country. You live the easiest life any human ever has or will, and you live it at the expense of others.

For most of human history, rape was normal and yet everyone agrees that rape is fucking horrible.


And you know what? The guy isn't even right. Out of seven billion people you can find a lot of people with incestuous feelings, but statistically it is **rare**. It is **not normal**. Anyone who has taken a college sociology class can tell you that there are so many psychological safeguards in place to prevent that.

It's not bullying, it's holding you up as an example to make sure nobody else becomes a creepy pervert. Just like all the other 'bullies' have been doing with you.

When I was young, I couldn't get a girlfriend to save my life. And then I tried a bunch of stuff and figured out what works.

Protip: If you're 20 years old, and you want a girlfriend, the easiest way to get one is *to ask a girl out.* You can lift weights until you're blue in the face, but if you don't actually ask a girl out, you're wasting your time.

A lot of them admit to not having dysphoria, or constantly talk about their genitals, some even say they never want to pass. I find it insulting.

If someone goes through medical transition to actually relieve dysphoria, then they're trans. If they do it for sexual reasons, they're a fetishist. If they do it to try to seem special or something, they're a trender.

But a ""trans girl"" talking about how much she enjoys her male genitals definitely comes across as fetishistic.

The difference between someone who is trans and someone who isn't is the presence of dysphoria. That's it really.

Trenders and fetishists tend to not have dysphoria, and the ones that take hormones will likely detransition in a year or two. 

I feel bad for people who really thought they were trans (but aren't) and detransitioned though, the ""you don't need dysphoria to be trans"" crowd doesn't see how harmful that idea is. It implies it's a choice, which it most fucking certainly is not. Not only is it harmful to the public view of dysphoric people, but it's harmful to people who might be GNC but end up thinking they're trans even though they don't have dysphoria."

There are “intersex” people who have underdeveloped sex organs (if male) or partially male developed sex organs (if female), which is basically a penis that didn’t fully develop and so still has maybe some “labia” or a tiny shaft, or if you’re a woman maybe a really large clitoris that seems like a micro penis because for some reason androgens were affecting you during development.

And there are those truly depraved MTFs that get SRS and ask the doctors to keep the penis but use colon tissue to make a “vagina” under it. And as we ALL know here, a “neovagina” is in NO WAY a vagina.

So no, you have not seen a true Futa. They will not exist until medical technology has improved substantially. And even then it will likely only be possible for biological females to have an organ-grown penis and balls attached to them. I could see that being a possibility in the future."

But if someone transitions medically because they're trying to satisfy a sexual desire or because they want to hop on the bandwagon or whatever, then they'd likely end up detransitioning later on."
1578,mundane_muffin,">There is no actual dysphoria and a fake one

I don't think there's a ""fake"" dysphoria. i just think someone is either born with the 'disconnect' that leads to dysphoria or they're not. And if they're not, then they're not trans. 

There are hypothesis for how this 'disconnect' happens, but of course there's no ethical way of testing that. it's not like we can just expose a fetus to a bunch of estrogen and see if we make a trans person. Research and MRI's have shown differences in the brain though. Nothing is 100% confirmed, but there's overwhelming evidence that this is very real.

It's a medical condition, not a lifestyle choice.

> What you do isn't more okay just because you can justify it.

what do I do? I'm changing my body and my presentation because it's the only thing that makes life tolerable. I don't see what's 'not okay' with that? 

>Any fetishist can say what you say, do what you do, and claim to be real and it's impossible to disprove.

Sure, and it upsets me that when people hear 'trans' these are the kind of people they think of. It's just another reason I don't like people knowing i'm trans. 

>Why? Because you are all fake.

believe me, I wish my dysphoria were fake. But it's always been there. If it were fake then this would all be so much easier, I wouldn't need to do any of this just to have a chance at being happy. I could just be normal. Unfortunately that's not my reality though.

> You also don't need to be trans. You can just not take hormones, not crossdress, not claim to be a woman and not take it out to public etc.

Sure, but my only other option here is death. I'm not stopping hormones and living the rest of my life as a man. I would rather die today.

What's the alternative? conversion therapy? that's been shown to not work and even be traumatic. We treat dysphoria with transition because it's proven to be the only thing that works for most dysphoric people.

We don't tell trans people they _are_ the same sex. I know I'm not a cis woman. But being seen as and treated like a man still makes me feel like shit. Being seen as and treated like a woman makes me feel... normal. 

>Again, your dysphoria is not a ""I can do whatever I want"" card. You can't also use suicide in that way. It just doesn't work, your behavior is still wrong and you could live without doing the whole trans thing.

I never implied otherwise. I'm not ""using suicide"" in any way. I'm expressing my very real options. I attempted suicide before HRT and only felt resentful because I failed. If I weren't able to start hormones, then I would have attempted again until I succeeded. And it probably would have only taken once more. I'm not using suicide as a way to validify my experience, but I most definitely would take that route if I weren't transitioning.

I'm painfully aware that I'm not and never will be a cis woman. But nothing I do can ever change that, so I'm just making the best of what I have."

1621,Krombopulos-Snake,"But this is exactly what happens on Reddit. The idea of letting people have their own things , even if you don't agree with them is no longer allowed anymore.

Put it like this. 
loli and shota, drawings get banned for being harmful to minors meanwhile, several of the transboards that specifically target real children and lure them into their creepy discords are still up. You know, I feel I shouldn't have to make the distinction between real and imaginary children but the way Reddit has been lately makes me do so.

Side note: I absolutely hate discord.  I just want to talk about/ play video games, not listen to mostly false, sometimes true stories of debauchery. Anyway.

A board about irrationally hating women is shut down, but any of the multiple boards about irrationally hating men are allowed to thrive - - *until they start hating transwomen!* THEN , it's time to shut them down. 

Name and shame is not allowed, until it's allowed.

Witchhunting is a global rule, it's just not allowed on this site---- until there are several boards completely dedicated to witch hunting and stalking. My favorite one, the one that's been stalking me for a year now finally got quarantined. Only after they targeted a fucking child - now they've been reduced to Frenworld nonsense trying to avoid being banned all together. 
This is noteworthy because for far too long this sub was above all the rules of Reddit. 

Being a pretend Communist is perfectly fine on Reddit, being a pretend Nazi is not. 
Even though both groups rounded up and killed people who disagreed, but don't say that on the commie subs. They'll have you hanged for that.

A board saying mean things about a billionaire liberal is considered a conspiracy board and shut down meanwhile, a board saying mean things about a billionaire conservative is considered normal and is allowed to operate. Fun Fact:* Both these men are terrible people and the fact that users on Reddit actually believe either of them are ""good guys"" is actually frightening to me.*

A board about how to get opiates is shut down - -yet several boards about how to get weed, cocaine and even make your own ""party favors""*Disclaimer: We do not condone or endorse this stuff, Safety not guaranteed* --  are still up and running. 

**Let's not even get into the endless amount abuse that the user verification systems have fostered over the years due to mods being sick , abusive assholes on the porn subs.**

A board of white people being racist assholes in the name of  politics is allowed to stay up while a board of white people being racist assholes just because they can, gets shut down.

tl;dr people like to pretend reddit is fair and just. 

Ultimately it's just a large chan with shittier rules than a regular chan - but unlike chans, people cannot play nice on reddit and just keep to their own circlejerks. They have to branch out and shut down other people's circlejerks in order to make themselves feel better.

But you know what?  I do not care about these subs. What I do care about is that all of them have the right to exist.  I know people hate me over the color of my skin, getting rid of their board doesn't change anything. 

I know people hate me over my opinions, boo hoo. I should still be able to post them and if someone feels like it, they should be able to argue with me without getting interrupted or brigaded or stopped by a pissy mod who doesn't like my colorful choice of words.

You can't have a real discussion if you surround yourself with people who only agree with you and nothing is honest when you force people to agree with you or risk losing their right to even post."

Lots of people aren't treated nicely by society and lots of people watch porn. Neither of these things directly cause dysphoria, because the majority of people who watch porn or get treated poorly by society don't start thinking that they can just declare themselves the opposite gender. 

It is ultimately still a problem with the individual. Lots of random psychopaths and serial killers experienced abuse and ostracism by society too. Are we supposed to blame society being meanies as the cause of everything's fault? No, we blame these psychopaths and serial killers for **choosing** to be shitty humans.

Not everyone has the option to talk about it with someone in their life of course and I get that, but the calmer posts around here have the right it that that some people are approaching gender in a fetishistic way. Not all, I dont think- I disagree with this sub on some of that- but I do think it is good to open the discussion to their being not one solution for everyone struggling with their gender in some way, shape, or form. My goal is to provide some support to these people but not through stereotyping fantasies of how the other sex ""works"" or fetishism encroaching on other public norms (e.g. underwear worn publically, etc).

Are there shitty trans people? Of course there are. But there are also many, many trans people who are just imperfect humans trying to find their way in the world like all the rest of us.

Here's an example:

A few years back, my wife and I decided to check out the ""swinger"" scene. Our expectation was that people in the scene would be having tons of sex. Much to our surprise, a lot of the men in the scene can't get it up anymore. We went to a couple parties, and it was full of women getting tied up in BDSM gear, but nobody was actually fucking. I watched some dude get blown for nearly an hour, and he couldn't get erect enough to penetrate his partner.

Another thing I noticed about the scene, was that we were literally the only people in a conventional relationship. Everyone else was poly or divorced.

I definitely wondered if their pursuit of a fetish led to the end of their relationships."

It's called puberty.

My detransition has been very successful so I'm one of the lucky ones and feel a moral obligation I guess to warn others. Including those who do it for fetish reasons because I'm not devoid of compassion.

I think a lot of what bothers me is sexual reassignment surgery feels a lot like mutilation to me. Were you offered therapy by anyone before they tried to persuade you to transition? Honestly I am all for people doing whatever they want with their lives as long as it doesn’t hurt other people but when I hear about children transitioning it makes me angry.

A few people did ask if I had perused therapy, but they were mostly drown out by the massive call of people telling me I'm actually trans.

I think the thing with the trans community is that they want to be supportive, but don't know how to approach the question of therapy. If you find a therapist who is not trans friendly then you're ""just hurting the person more by denying them of their true body"" or something like that, and that's oppressive, and we can't have that. 

But at the same time you need a therapist who will make you seriously consider your choices and make you question if you actually want to transition.

Ok.

Its just so typical. They are MRA in drag. Its pretty damn male to just decide their ego matters more than what being a woman actually IS.

They literally think y'all are freak shows and they're right. Trans people do not pass at all, particularly men who feel like they are women. Maybe if they're black out drunk, maybe....but once they discover a fucking penis they will run as fast as they can. Its so hilarious how out of touch with reality people are. Actions speak louder than words. Think about the constant affirmation trans people get online, just words. But what about real life? Women don't accept them. Straight men definitely do not. I don't know about gay men but trans people would definitely feel better if they just admitted they were gay. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Being trans, you'll never have sex with a straight man, will never be feminine, will always be a laughingstock outside of the media and the internet. Why someone would choose this over accepting that they are gay, the world will never know. May too much internet, isolation as a child, no friends, too much porn, virgins, etc."

They have never lived an entire experience of a woman, physical, social and psychological. What is their precious choice predicated on? What exactly do they think they are choosing?

The most stupid contradiction of all? We ALL technically choose to be a woman. Every single day we biological women don’t choose to go under the knife and become a man. Y’know, the way they became women?"

The 2016 election basically confirmed it with all the chatter around foreign influence over the internet and social media, but it seemed like people didn't get the gravity of the situation.

It makes total sense. Social media is basically a window to the minds of an entire nation's youth, and only in the most free countries (the west) did you really have that off the bat. As much as I wanted to believe it was tin foil, it made no sense for nations/factions/powers at be to not be messing with it.

Cisgender, either male or female (which is invariable used pejoratively) is a modern pseudo word which has no working etymology but attempts to force some other scientific etymology (relating to molecular chemistry) to serve an entirely erroneous purpose.  It is an attempt to define in terms that have nothing to do with those being defined so as to make those so described seem parallel with those who have ""chosen"" to define otherly.

Doctor will get a stiff (it is bad joke day🥳) letter from their HR telling them that they are transphobic and that they should apologize and review the diagnosis or else.

From a personal experience, I was misdiagnosed with something a few years back. Basically what happened is that I saw an in-training doctor, described a symptom, and she immediately gave me a prescription without any further explanation. I thought it was weird, but mostly forgot about it, until 2 years later when I saw another doctor and she asked how my (insert medical condition I don't have) was doing, and I was like ""what? I don't have that"" Turns out that first doctor must've put down that I had that condition when she gave me the prescription, but after I explained that no, I was confident I didn't have any symptoms of that, it didn't seem to be too much of a big deal and I've never been asked about it since.

No idea if it's still on my record, but even if it is, it's not a big deal for me to explain that it was a fuck-up, and no, I've never even taken that medication prescribed because I don't need it."

2210,dodadoBoxcarWilly,"RT America has a short documentary that features three detransitioners. All had bottom surgery, two went back to living as men, one regretted it but had been living as a woman so long, they didn't think it would beneficial to go back at this point. One of the ones who did go back to living as a man, runs a support group for people considering it. All three had it back before transition on demand became the norm, and they still regretted it eventually. And if I remember right, all three were abused as children.

Regardless of how you feel about RT, and the criticisms are many and valid, it was an interesting watch. I think it was linked in a thread on this sub, but I can't seem to find it."
2211,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"> Speaking of documentaries, I watched a PBS doc in the very early 80s about MtF transsexuals.

There's a Netflix documentary about prostitution in the 70s. One of the eye-opening things, was that something like 70% of the prostitutes were men wearing dresses.

Like, I had NO IDEA this was A Thing. (Way before my time.)

But if we all agree that men have been getting turned on by putting on dresses for ages, then it makes sense."

The rise in young females(16-23 especially) that are choosing to get expensive elective surgery to remove their breasts is astounding. I don't have the numbers but in my area(north east United states near NYC) it's clear that the population has exploded like if it was pokemon go. It's very clear these young women have zero idea what they're doing to their body permanently. 

Most of them I speak with are just normal lesbians. I dont understand when they try to bro out with me and comment on my new boots or truck or facial hair. The whole thing seems like a social contagion. I think the pharma industry is directly responsible. If hormones weren't being pushed so hard nobody would want to cut off their sexual organs to try to look like the other sex... because they'd never even pass a little. Not like any of the ones I interact with do pass.

2248,HormelBrapocalypse,Don't these kinds of things are normally pretty esoteric to those not familiar with healthcare and modern health IT.  Also some doctors still do all of their stuff by hand or through some horrible bastardized spreadsheet or who know what type of digital record management.

I'll check out the book you mentioned. However, this is a book. Books can be good, but this is not even literature, it's a non-scientific book for the general public written by a guy that did not even study medicine but is a therapist instead. 

If you want to make bold claims like these, you'll need tens if not hundreds of proper scientific studies, along with large scale systematic reviews and meta analyses peer reviewed by experts and committees and hundreds of scientific journal clubs. 

A book written by one person is not enough, let alone it nog even being a scientific literature book."

I see a few possibilities:
1) You're a genuine idiot who thinks one book can deconstruct an entire medical system
2) You lack education and have good intentions but are unintentionally a bigot
3) You know you are wrong to think like this without any scientific evidence, but don't want to/can't realize you should change your views, because you somehow gain something from calling others' mental problems a fetish instead of respecting them. That makes you an asshole."

Narcissus was a healthy young man who fell under a curse that caused him to have such an obsessive attraction to the physical image of another (Narcissus did not realize the image he was looking at was himself) that it drove him to suicide. Him being sexually attracted to his own image under the curse is strongly implied. I think comparing them to Narcissus is pretty apt."
2332,winewatcher,"No, cis people can be gay or lesbian. It’s not about sexual orientation. It’s about whether you think the doctor and science were right when they said you were a boy or girl at birth (leaving aside the instances of intersex which is another issue.

Cis is a made up term, invented by TRAs (Trans Rights Activist’s) to label the rest of us, the majority of people,  as “others”. This labeling is a linguistic act of aggression. There is no need for a qualifier before “man” or “woman”.

Increasingly, many lesbians and gays, as well as some boys, and many if not most heterosexuals reject this term. Even some trans who medically transitioned fully (who tend to be older and stand in opposition to the new TRAs) - most notably transman Buck Angel - are starting to argue against the use of “cis”."

2342,winewatcher,"Good for you! Very brave. 

When you point out the doublethink to allies of trans you are also pointing out that they have been duped - and duped in the sense of brainwashing. No one likes that feeling even if they can’t articulate it. So they label it bigotry or hateful which are the politically correct tropes of the day. They might even lash out angrily toward you. 

When you point out doublethink to a trans person their fragile sense of self starts to crumble with nothing to replace it. They often come out raging, projecting what they are doing on to you. They may engage in bullying and threats - anything not to face the truth."

Joseph Goebbels was ahead of his time. He is currently salivating in hell at the tools of the 21st century for mass manipulation.

He also envisioned cable TV decades before it became a reality and yes...it was for the purpose of deception.

This quote from Goebbels could've just as easily been said today....

*If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State*"

It's not normal to constantly miss out on the 'girlhood' you could have had.  It's bizarre.  If you really are interested in living your life as a woman you would want to do age appropriate things that women rather than anime characters and little girls normally do.

You can not compare that to Satanic panic nonsense, or even something like Columbine, which was a flash in the pan.

And, okay, I'll admit I wasn't alive in the 70's or coherent for most of the 80's, but were people ever being fired from their careers for listening to music that Christian fundamentalist groups didn't like?

2544,newRoad5,"“EXHIBITIONISM FETISH.” fuck right off. Dude. Im a woman with an exhibition fetish, who has also had involuntary porn distributed, walked into a house party of people I didn’t even know who had my (16 yo) naked pic on their wall, full spread eagle of course. I’ve been kidnapped, for real. A changing room stalking and kidnapping isn’t exhibitionism! Like, what the fuck you nasty rapists. Exhibitionism occurs in a space where everyone consents to the exhibition. Public displays of sexual behavior where everyone doesn’t consent to your sexual activities is sexual assault. I don’t know what female woman would try to be seen changing in a clothing store, sounds like something a male woman would do, but if a female woman did do that, she would be a sexual offender. Why does this prick assume we don’t have exhibition fetishes, when this post isn’t about exhibition whatsoever? And even if there are female women with rape fetishes— having a rape fetish doesn’t make you female."

1: Have whatever behavior and interests you want! I wasn't very feminine, although I know a lot of my peers who were. Being a ""girl"" doesn't force you into any behavior or personality type, that would be horribly misogynistic.

2: Have two ovaries and a uterus."

2573,brujablanca,"Females are never overweight, depressed, and NEVER lie in their beds. 

Becoming female will magically fix all of these issues because girls are always pretty, happy, and perky.  . 

This is what happens when men don’t have female friends or family they’re really close with. They get their information on what women are from media like anime and movies, which of course we all know is shockingly inaccurate. They don’t see women as humans with the same issues as men, they see us as something wholly different. He’s been brainwashed.

His language is just so telling. As if being female makes you exempt from these human issues. It really highlights how they are just men with severe issues that they think women don’t have to suffer through and therefore becoming a woman will fix all their problems. 

It’s delusional and sexist. We’re not human to them. We’re an idea."
2574,khaste,But isnt the trans movement all about not  sticking to gender norms and not have to portray yourself as a certain gender in public? You guys are all about being biologically male but calling yourselves female just for the hell of it right?

2578,QueenRowana,"I mean... men can ‘act’ like women all they want. Famous actors on stage do it. In comedy shows it happens all the time. Who can forget John Travolta playing the mother in Hairspray. It happened historically before women were allowed on stage in elizabethan times. 
Drag queens do it. Most do it poorly but on occasion a drag queen actually gets it right. 


So men can ‘act’ like women all they want. That is definitely possible. That’s not my issue. 
My issue is when they say they “are” women. That they are actually physically female. Which is of course impossible. 

Saying you  are a woman when your sex is actually male falls under  speech (i guess). Same free speech gives me the right to still call them men. Same right of speech gives me the right to still call him Dave instead of “Stacey”. 

My issue with these men starts when they decide it isnt an act but a reality. When they decide they are now entitled to things intended for biological women (pads without Venus symbols, gynecologists, change rooms, rape shelters). 

The issue is not that they act like women. But that they demand to be treated as though they are biologically female."

Are you unhappy that you don’t have the body type of a muscular “old spice comercial” kind of guy? Don’t have any friends offline? Fails at making eye contact, don’t know how to talk to women, are you going bald? Well we have a solution for you sir. Just become a fetichist caricature!

I mean, wouldn’t it just be easier to fix each stuff as a man? Probably, but how could they chose the “woman is a feeing” hill to die on then. 

I have said it before and I will say it again: they are taking the wrong kind of hormones. There is no way those guys are producing enough testosterone for their male bodies to work properly. Lay off the Mountain Dew, dude, have some steak and salad, exercise, get some social classes (like dancing or cooking) to meet people. This is not a healthy approach to fix depression."
2584,KweenOfKawaii,This is a good point. If only he actually knew a thing about women. He’s gonna have it worse as a fat woman than a fat man. Imagine trying to MAKE yourself a minority. Imagine trying to identify out of your privilege just to put on a dress and be pretty.

There’s no such thing as acting like a woman, because there’s no one way to be a woman or any behavior that makes you a woman. What drag queens act out aren’t women, they’re mere caricatures of what they think women act or should act like."

2607,ravenclaw188,Never ends does it
2608,QueenRowana,"Precisely!

Most drag queens are just loud and obnoxious men in a wig. Some drag queens do a somewhat better job than others, less blatantly stereotypical, less over-the-top-screaming-housmaid awefulness. If they do it semi professionally, more like an actor would than the way a drag queen normally does, then i have a very grudging respect for that. If it is professional, if they know and recognize themselves that it is an act. I was on stage once playing a male, professionally playing and portraying a different sex is hard. I respect those who do it well. But only as long as they realize it is still acting. It is still pretending. They are not and will never be woman. Just the same as me being on stage as a man did not make me male.

&#x200B;

You are correct that i should not have said ""getting it right"", because obviously a man can never  get being a woman right. What i think i meant was that some drag queens do it better and less offensively stereotypical. But you are correct, they do not actually get it right. It is still an act. That is my issue. Sure they can áct like a woman all they like. But they can never be one."

2624,,I don’t believe any of those theories. They aren’t based in science. These TIMs have always existed the only difference now is we have TIMs online requiring eggs. Pretty much every gender non confirming kid is being told they are trans. They are writing articles that you can tell your kids gender by 5 years old from their voice for crying out loud. Also autisim has increased a bit and there’s a massive link between autisim and being a TIM or TIF.

I did also review sex toys for a while and had to get used to switching up terms so things didn’t get too repetitive, but still stayed away from being erotic or too sterile or too childish. Cunt is blunt enough to do that job. 


I am Australian though and cunt holds *a lot* less power as a word here than it does in the US. When I finally cracked and googled what the “c-word” was, and found out it was only cunt, I was kinda dumbfounded."

What does made me 😤is that in tacking on the trans piece, and in using the image to state that it’s a girl doing the dick sucking, the whole thing becomes a fantasy about being female being the ultimate (titillating) humiliation. Just NO.

At least as far as mtfs go, I thought the concept was you were born with a female brain in a male body, or something close to that. However, I don't think people even care about that anymore. It seems to be more about incels pushing hormones onto other incels, a warped sense of how females operate, and fetishizing the idea of being a woman.

2977,commupissed,"No it's not like that at all, more or less talk about how you are still a woman even if biologically male is more so a way to cope than anything else. Trans people may still opt for surgery but some try to stay comfortable with the body they were born with due to complications such as money issues, attitudes of family and peers, or any other valid reason people can have for not outwardly transitioning or not taking steps to receive surgeries or hormones. For many state funded surgeries and such would help out tremendously due to shitty American healthcare (assuming you're from the states) learning the mannerisms of the other sex can also help you pass better. Do you also act this way towards actors and writers who people study? While I understand that those are definitely not the same thing and only somewhat comparable I think it gets my point across.
 
Women aren't some hallow character, that's correct but no one is claiming or acting like they are. While being a woman is more complex than that so is being trans. It's not just ""men with a fetish"" you completely ignore that these people are also complex with their own complex issues. While there are bad people in every group often times a majority of trans people disavow them, trans people just want to live their lives like how you live yours they just also want to take steps to be seen as the gender they identify as.
 
What I want to know is why care what others identify as? Who cares? While women have there own complex issues that deserve to be addressed that isn't an argument against dismantling preconceived ideas of sex and it's relation to gender, we don't really have anything to lose by having loser definitions of gender. Along with that men aren't all that bad, most men aren't, again every group has its own bad apples. At the end of the day neither of us are doing anything that's going to change the world were just losers going on Reddit. Sorry if my writing was a clusterfuck I tend to ramble."

As a guy, I cannot convince them otherwise because I am not a woman -- they fail to see the hypocrisy in this belief. Coming from an actual woman, this is a valid criticism, but you'd have to be blind to think somehow being a woman in Western Society is easy mode.

They don't get that their perceived easy mode is because you have to walk on eggshells to not offend them and their frothing enablers who call everything transphobia.

I think that agp can be related to  the maternal deprivation. Zucker and Langstrom in their epidemiological study of transvestism found that transvestism is related to early separation from parents.  Also there is evidence  from animal studies  that maternal deprivation  sensitizes dopaminergic system and it can facilitate attachment to random objects. There is Marshall's theory of paraphilias based on  the attachment theory.   [**u/AroillaBuran**](https://www.reddit.com/user/AroillaBuran/)  talks more about mechanical cognitive processes, but she should think more about attachment. 

&#x200B;

"" The effects of maternal deprivation are presumably similar to those observed in Harlow’s laboratory studies on infant monkeys separated from their mothers.

Of course. As long as I'm completely anonymous, I greatly appreciate every person fighting a battle I cannot fight.

I go against my ethics, common sense and Hippocratic Oath constantly with TiMs. It's humiliating: I'm a glorified rx machine. Comply with their insane demands or commit career suicide.

\> And for the cosmetic surgeons, making a nice chunk of change for turning a penis inside out, seems like a pretty good motivator to me.

You're spot on. I have nothing but respect for our scalpel jockies but they're not the type to turn down easy cash for ethical reasons. Surgeons are a breed of their own. 

\> ""but doctors recommend transitioning as treatment for gender dysphoria""

This is not a lie, but it's extremely misleading. A more accurate way of looking at it is: ""doctors are bullied into recommending whatever the hell placates TiM patients sufficiently to avoid being sued/fired."" I could tell you what I personally consider the best treatment if you're curious, but a tl;dr would be I am the absolute last resort after all other options have been exhausted.

But none of that explains why I want to be a woman or at least have a female's body. I can't be a woman. I am me. My personality has no specific one and I lean masculine.

Further transgressions can be explained by sexual frustration, social isolation, rejection, availability of porn, etc. I have interest in more early  psychological processes. It is easy to  heal latest  traumas related  to frustration, social isolation, etc, but it is more difficult to deal with early maternal deprivation.

A friend was part of a leftist org based in an American east coast city. Most of the men would go into the org, which was Third Worldist, as cis white males aka the worst, and within a few weeks or a month or two come out as trans. There was just this pipeline of trans members discovering the new white dude is actually trans, and shockingly, no longer the worst, but one of the oppressed.

She bumped into one or two around the city after they'd left the org. No longer trans, and they explictly said they felt a great amount of pressure to question their gender and on top of that to experiment, with the paradox that once you are doing that you're by definition part of it. They knew it wasn't them and left the org entirely rather than be framed as having gone back in the closet etc.

I don't think this is the case in all cases but it does seem to be an issue that within some subgroups this sort of thing is pushed."

To be fair, there are a lot of gay people who have statistically unlikely numbers of gay friends. People cluster together around interests and identities.

-How do you think gender dysphoria differs from the experience of body dysmorphia, if at all? I have BD, and have noticed parallels between it and GD, but BD involves more checking myself in the mirror to obsess over the flaws, while I’d imagine GD might involve less OCD-ish checking behaviors?

-Does your GD ebb and flow in intensity? Is it triggered by anything in particular?

-Do you think your GD is related to the way gender has been socially constructed? IE, if men were socially sanctioned to engage in “feminine” pursuits, would your dysphoria be affected? 

-is “gender euphoria” a thing (as opposed to AGP euphoria?)

-Is therapy helping you at all? Did the estradiol help at all? Are you opposed to taking psychiatric drugs in general? If not, have they helped?

Thanks so much for being willing to answer questions, and feel free to ignore any/all of mine. I just find GD really interesting, and wish I could understand it better. I hope you can figure out how to manage yours and find self-acceptance."

3122,ParagonDeku,Are you telling me the feminist sub LIKES rigid gender norms?
3123,ZsZagreb,"First off, sorry for the long post here. This reminded me of my senior year writing papers for hours on end, I miss that.

Some background, I'm a 20 y/o natural born male struggling with gender dysphoria.

1.) I don't really think there's a big difference. I also just look at myself in the mirror and obsess over things I wish I could change. I think the major difference would be that GD *ALSO* focuses on genitals where BD might/likely focus more on aspects like a flabby stomach or a double chin (although it is different for everyone) I'll often be laying there or walking around and be reminded of my penis and get that general feeling of unease that is dysphoria. At times I'll audibly make a noise of and/or grab myself in a gesture of frustration.

2.) I wouldn't say anything really triggers the bad feelings, it's more like a mild pain or a toothache. If I'm preoccupied then I don't really notice, but the thoughts undoubtedly creep in if there's nothing else (work mostly) going on. But you're constantly thinking about it when out in public, just wishing you could be anybody else other than yourself.

3.) This is a loaded topic but here's my two cents. 

\*I personally believe that (especially for younger people) these ""constructs"" can cause a type of dysphoria. Lets say a male child likes playing with dolls, or wants to wear dresses or grow his hair out. If parents or teachers say that that's something only a girl does, then that child will feel more inclined to identify as a girl, and will then feel uncomfortable when partaking in those activities as it's something that has been engrained in him as socially taboo. In reality, none of these things should be treated as gendered, and they should let their child come to their own conclusions. There's nothing wrong with boys playing with dolls or having long hair or even wearing a dress, unless we tell them that it's wrong. They are just things, and we are just humans. Does that make sense?

\*I like swords, dancing, star wars, history and long pants. There is nothing inherently gendered about these items and there shouldn't be. They are things and I am me, that is the way it should be for all things.

4.) On the topic of gender specifically, I haven't experienced ""gender euphoria"". I would say it's more like an ebb and flow of *content* and *malcontent*. Sometimes you don't think about it and you feel good about yourself and where you are in life, while other times... Really there is no better way to say it. I would assume it's similar to BD. 

\*Really for me, all there is is envy and longing for a vagina, and I don't think that unless I magically get one I'll have any form of euphoria any time soon regarding gender in any way.

\*And autogynophilia is honestly kind of gross, and makes a mockery of the people tha actually have dysphoria. AGP is most commonly read into as a fetish and I honestly believe it should be treated as such. If putting on a certain pair of underwear gets your rocks off then fine, just leave it in the bedroom and don't claim to have a crippling mental disorder to ""fit in"". (I realize that in saying this, some people will feel excluded or targeted or triggered. Sorry but that's just my view and I don't believe it will change. In all my years I've never been turned on for dressing in a way that made me feel more comforatble. Learn to accept/push past your fetish to figure out whether or not that's all it is or if it's something more, only then come forward with claims of mental illness, otherwise you will look a mockery. Just look at most of the posts on this subreddit.)

5.) Therapy is nice in that it gives me a place to go and a person to talk to; a person I can trust to hash out these tough topics. I don't really have any friends or anyone to talk to so it's really nice to have a person to go to; it also helps with depression. Though I don't think it helps with dysphoria. I think the only thing that could help with that right now is passing as a female/just getting a vagina (even though that option is years and many many drugs away). That's a big reason I'm still in this boat, as I see no real other way out.

\*As soon as I started taking Estrodial I had second thoughts. The Idea that there could be irreversable damage done to my body hit a lot harder when I was actually taking the pills. The danger of **sterility, possible surgery to remove breast growth, and the irreversable effects of bottom surgery** (I've heard of people who wanted to go back after getting bottom surgery. I couldn't imagine...) 

\*I'm not against drugs, they can do wonderful things for some people. While I personally have qualms with drugs because of some poor choices I made some years back, I'd rather not take any unless I have to. I do take Abilify to help with sleep though.

First of all, are you all against ALL trans or just those who are displaying signs of autogynephilia? Based on the responses I get, I'd like to ask some more. I spent LOADS of time studying trans issues back in 2015-2018 (watching hundreds of videos, reading alot of books, articles, and studies, etc) and can say that I have a grasp on what's going on but i'm open to different perspectives. From my perspective, it seems there is no one true ""trans"" person, which is prevalent in pretty much everything in life. People have different reasons they transition, have different perspectives of gender (which can influence gender identity and gender expression), have different resources that are available to them (which can influence how well someone can transition, how early they can transition, if they are even aware of where they even are on the gender/sexuality spectrum, etc), have different factors that contribute to the basis of their gender, etc... I remember first discovering the term ""autogynephilia"" through a Youtuber name ""Rod Fleming"". The guy is pretty much open about dating transwomen (particularly, asian ladyboys).. he had a video series some years ago explaining the differences between HSTS and AGPs. You guys should check it out.

I think the real problem here is how the west puts women on a pedestal and then tells men, ""and you'd better go get one or else you're a complete fucking loser and deserve to rot and die.

Maybe, but I know for sure many are not and just want to become trans for their own fucked up desires (fetishes, victim complex, oppression points, etc). These predators are not just harmful to bio women they are also harmful to the trans community (because most have a trans fetish). And yes, this does mean that I'm okay with trans women who are passing--but my definition of passing isnt how feminine someone looks, it's about how aware they are of women's rights (bio and trans, and what makes the rights of each different as well). But, trans women should definitely not have a say in women's rights as they will never have the full experience of being a woman.
I dont mind talking about this in DMs if you wish because I'm always open to learning others POV and finding a middle ground where everyone can benefit."
3160,Millicent98,Both HSTS and AGPs are men. They are not and will never be women.
3161,DykeWithANutAllergy,"We are not ""against"" trans people, we are against the idea that men who wish to be women, for whatever reason, are completely identical to women and must be treated identically. This endangers women, since we must share showers, prisons, changing rooms etc with ANY dude who wants to get in, so we have no protection from predators. It also means we cannot name the real for female oppression - our reproductive organs - without triggering or excluding men who deserve to be excluded. Men can pretend to be women to steal our scholarships and job opportunities in STEM since they have benefited from male privilege and been encourage to work in STEM their whole lives, and they cannot get pregnant so employers won't have to pay maternity leave. Plus misogynists will happily hire fake women who count towards their equality statistics when they wouldn't hire real women.

Do you see how trying to be nice to ""real"" trans women, however you define that, leaves all women and girls vulnerable to predators like Jessica Yaniv and Karen White? Isn't it suspicious that so many trans women refuse to have their own spaces safe from men, they demand to share ours?"

3166,smiolet,Hey make your own post and I think you'll get better answers
3167,tgrewy,There is an actual debate sub
3168,Llamayoda,"Trans people go out of their way to recruit autistic men who are naturally less romantically gifted.

People who are not romantically successful generally have extreme degenerate sexual preferences, often climaxing into deluding themselves into thinking they’re trans. 

Spend 5 minutes on /r9k/ and you will be bombed by pages and pages of transsexual propaganda targeting incels."
3169,thro_way,"It has a lot more to do with androgenic hormones than it does society telling us to do something, how society depicts male sexuality is just a reflection of what is already occurring.  It's like saying that dogs bark because society depicts them as barking... while society does indeed do this it isn't the *cause* of the behavior.  I assure you that young men in Victorian England wanted sex just as badly if not more than men today."
3170,mubi_merc,"> Current estimates are that roughly half the population is introverted

What does that have to do with anything? Introverts absolutely make connections and find relationships, especially ones that are aware of their introversion. It make take a little more work for an introvert, but picking random people up at a bar generally doesn't yield successful relationships anyway."
3171,littlerbear,"Women deal with all manner of oppression in western countries, so the 'pedestal' comment shows that you have no idea what women's real lives are like. 

It's unfortunate that certain men believe that they're complete losers without a girlfriend, but it's up to them to form an identity that they're comfortable with. Women always have to find a way of making themselves at least reasonably comfortable in society because we're never pretty enough, nice enough, whatever enough for patriarchal standards. Men can do the same thing. Maybe men should be kinder to each other, support each other in ways that allow other men to develop healthy psyches so they can have good relationships with women. Short of that, there's therapy.

If the guys you're talking about aren't 'ready' for serious relationships, and they're not having 'serious' relationships there's no issue. 

No lack of female attention makes any man who's not already mentally ill in some way decide that he's 'really' a woman. Men who believe they're women are delusional; this has nothing to do with the behavior of women in general society and has everything to do with some neurological or psychological misfiring in the guy's brain."
3172,theosphicaltheo,"Yeah Incels as in capital I Incels that have hate for women are terrible, I was referring to the men / teen males that who are not receiving mutual female attention who then wander into areas where they are preyed on by transwomen and told that they are transwomen.

Yep. It's well known that disorders (whether mental or physical) are on a spectrum.. It's funny because i'm autistic myself yet anyone who knows me in real life wouldn't know because people have a stereotypical view of what an ""autistic"" person is that they can't grasp that it's to varying degrees. This also applies to incels and political views. Incels are incels for different reasons. Hence, why there are different types of incel communities (look up the Incel wiki and they go much more in depth)."

3179,,[removed]
3180,FickleShame,"I think ""but androgens!"" is a little simplistic. Guys want sex and a great deal of male identity is bound up in finding a sexual partner to start a family with, no matter how much guys want to pretend they're eternal bachelors, but that doesn't explain, as I said above, chemically castrating yourself on the off chance you'll be able to pass for a woman for 10, 15 years before age makes a fool out of you.


There is absolutely something to be said for how aggressively idealized women are in society. It makes perfect sense that when women are repeatedly depicted as happy, cute and living care-free lives that some guys are going to draw the conclusion that they can get a slice of that pie by becoming one. 


...and of course there's still the statistical reality that many transwomen are actually just gay men who were effectively gas lit into it. Being gay was unacceptable but masquerading as a woman was A-OK in their minds. 


...And of course sometimes it's because we're holding children and people who are mentally children to the standard of an idealized adult who is strictly logical. Children crave attention and I've seen more than one case where a son was found to be transgendered only for it to later come out that what was *really* going on was that the family had another child- a girl- and the boy's prepubescent mind came to the conclusion that if he were a girl he'd get the attention his parents were now putting towards his baby sister.


....and of course sometimes it's just the fact that humans are social creatures and fitting in is a real social pressure we all feel at some point in our lives. There's been entire studies that came to the conclusion that some people identify as trans for no reason other than that it grants them very real power over other people and makes them virtually immune to bullying and teachers wouldn't dare fuck with them.  


It's a little too easy to pluck any abnormalities out of a story, dust off the context and hold it up as *the cause* for transgenderism. The great, grand curse of social sciences is that attempts to explain human behavior often leave you with vague generalities because it's exceedingly difficult to explain the entire human experience under simple, narrow focus."
3181,FickleShame,">which is to say they don't find large social gatherings enjoyable, **not that they're antisocial**"
3182,FickleShame,A pedestal can have it's own ball and chain. If you don't think a woman can't walk into a crowd of men and immediately dominate their attention- negative or positive- you're incredibly naive. The only thing a pedestal gives you is more exposure. It's not necessarily negative or positive.
3183,trevkon,"Kind of answers it though. Look at the downvotes your comment is getting. Maybe if you go through the posts on this sub, you’ll see what everyone here thinks about transgenders.  I used to be inclusive, advocating transgenders as well. But it gets to a certain point where you just sit back and think “why”? HOWEVER, I maybe shouldn’t lump them all into one group. There are  some transgenders who I can stomach, like YouTuber blaire white, who I find infinitely less repulsive than other transgenders. The group seems to have an inability to THINK. They have this inability to stay  out of places where no one wants them. or have really creepy and borderline rape like mindsets. but again, I cannot generalize them all, this will then justify people generalizing gay people or people of color or men. All I can say is that from what I have seen, most of them are not of sound mind."

3188,thro_way,"Don't know what to say other than well put, you have these questions pinned down perfectly.

My possible disagreement is that male sexuality has a >0% internal locus of hormones rather than being 100% socially motivated, but the social component does exist and if you didn't mean to suggest that it's the only component then we don't disagree.  Seriously you write very well.

EDIT:

>Being gay was unacceptable but masquerading as a woman was A-OK in their minds.

I don't think anyone perceives transgenderism as more socially acceptable than homosexuality.  It's hard to think of anything in media/socially that would lead them to believe this.  Concerning this Blanchard typological group, transgenderism is a heightened or less restrained form of their expressions of femininity.  It's more, not less."

3194,FickleShame,">I don't think anyone perceives transgenderism as more socially acceptable than homosexuality.


It's become a statistically relevant portion of the trans community- men who just discover later in life that they're gay. 


And it's less about external acceptance and more about resolving internal inconsistencies. These men find themselves attracted to men, but are 100% certain they're not gay. The internet tells them it sounds like they might be transgendered. This makes sense because they realize they're not men attracted to men but instead a woman trapped in a man's body who's actually straight."
3195,Kidneyjoe,"> I don't think anyone perceives transgenderism as more socially acceptable than homosexuality.

You'd be surprised. The most blatant example is Iran where ""sex reassignment"" is openly and legally regarded as a ""cure"" for homosexuality. Turns out those old religious texts that instruct people to kill homosexuals don't have near as much to say about ""transgender"" individuals. Makes for a convenient out for religious fundamentalists that don't want to displease their god but also don't want to stone their gay or lesbian family members to death."

I can guarantee this will not happen. They wanted to ban NeoVaginadisaster not because it was a hate sub, but because it showed the crude reality of what they are doing to their bodies. Most of them lie about how wonderful it is to get SRS."

3304,TwatchWaffle," It’s hard to be sympathetic considering the amount of hate they spew towards anyone who disagrees with them and what they are doing to women however I can’t help but really feel for some of these people. 

I think of the ‘geeky’ young boy, maybe suffering from AGP, maybe just feeling no one could love the body he has. He goes online to receive a massive dose of love bombing from the cult, no matter what he says it’s always ‘yup you’re a cracked egg, you’re trans, cut it off and cut everyone out of your life who doesn’t agree, they are evil TERFs’ then they attack anything that says other wise to make sure this young boy ONLY sees their opinion. Somehow every person who regretted SRS is a bigot, every person trying to protect this boy by showing him the actual-no joke- truth about what to expect is silenced one way or another. Doctors are silenced, researchers are silenced, therapists silenced, the few parents that seem to care enough -silenced. 

It’s one thing seeing these people seek out the echo chamber, it’s another seeing there is nothing but the echo chamber left so even young people trying to make informed decisions, can’t."

The fact that it started out with the wife stating that the dude specifically told her it was a fetish is just so priceless.

When I crossdress I look and act just like the person I am. When I crossdress I still refer to myself by name and I still expect or hope to be referred to as a male. Trying to be someone else flies directly in the face of what it's all about. These people ruin it for all of us.

These guys are traps for insecure heterosexual women who just want to fit in. And the relationship always either ends, ends up in abuse, and more recently, ends up like this. Nothing new to see here. These types of men are incredibly repressed and end up fetishizing the taboo they were told to keep far, far away from (in this case, femininity). These types of men always need to pick themselves up and shake themselves off and constantly fear being seen as ""less than a man"", and pick on those men who have enough confidence to express the full range of their personality. They usually pick up the most frail, fragile, submissive and feminine women with extreme stockholm syndrome, and build toxic, imbalanced and dysfunctional environments for the children they usually end up bringing into this world.

I was wearing jeans and hoodies throughout my teenage years. In fact, I hated how much attention my breasts would get from creepy old men, so I would purposefully wear baggie clothes to draw less attention to my body.  Teen girls and women who dress like prostitutes are rare. And grown women who dress like prostitutes to their kid's school are even more rare.

It's a fetish, but I *also* think there's a lot of crossover with other mental disorders and fetishes.

For instance, I used to date a borderline for a few years. The only thing that made her truly happy was being the center of attention. It didn't matter if the attention was good, or bad. As long as she was getting attention, she was good. But if things got slow, she'd just gravitate towards whatever would generate a bunch of drama.

The other part that I see in this fetish a lot, is **sadism.** They often get a kick out of making things uncomfortable or downright painful for other people.

Put all of these things together, and imagine living a life where you got excited by:

1) making things wildly uncomfortable for the people around you

2) making everything about YOU, 24x7

As you can imagine, that would quickly burn-out everyone in your social circle. And I think that's why you see so many TiMs online whining about how they want a girlfriend, want friends, are lonely, etc... They've burned everyone around them."

My wife and I argue about this one all the time, but here goes:

I went to a Catholic school and I knew *tons* of families where the Dad was gay and the family seemed to be quite functional. 

When I say that, my wife is always horrified, basically thinks that gay men MUST come out of the closet, no ""ifs"", ""ands"", or ""buts.""

I don't know exactly how it went down, but I got the impression that quite a few of my classmates had parents that were religious and got married in their 20s, got a job and started a family... And then at some point it was just super-obvious that Dad was gay.

If any of you are into ""90 Day Fiance"", there's a couple like that on the current season. The dude seems super nice and sweet and well intentioned, but he's also 100% gay, and he's looking for a wife. In the last episode, she was super upset because he couldn't get it up for her."

The trans movement is about mainly women catering to perverted, sick men so that they can feel sexually satisfied.

""Because if it was a man saying he refuses to go down on women because they smell bad and he doesnt trust them to clean well enough, he would be called a misogynist and rightfully so. Vaginas have a smell, it's natural and normal. Trying to prevent any smell is just weird, and promotes all those terrible Summers Eve products that shame women.

So I feel the same way about a penis. If they're an adult, they should have simple hygiene practices that keep most smells at bay. If a man is showering once a day, they dont need to take an extra one just because there may be sweat from a few hours. Theres also sweat on her vagina.

Women are expected to suck dick regardless of condition. Women are expected to be freshly showered and shaven before men even think about going down. 


BUT ALSO — calling vaginas smelly is DIRECTLY related to misogynistic commentary on women. Like it isn’t the goddamn same because the historical and sociocultural context isn’t the same.

Showering everyday would be normally fine, but for this woman she has a sensitive nose so the extra effort isn’t asking for much. It’s a contextual key here.

3791,bigpapi579,"Oh fuck off. There is a difference between finding yourself attractive and getting turned on by yourself. Funny how all the stories about adolescents' stealing their mom's or sister's clothes and masturbating while wearing them are from males. If you are or have ever been aroused by the thought of yourself as a woman, you have autogynephilia. If your cross-gender identity did not develop in very early childhood, like before the ages of 3 or 4, than your desire to be a woman is rooted in paraphilic arousal. Most of us who admit to being AGP like myself have a similar story to yours. I have always preferred the company of females and cross-gender feelings appeared before puberty. My cross-gender feelings originated from when I was turned on by the idea of wearing pantyhose when I was 7 and I eventually started fetishistically crossdressing when I was 13. The paraphilic arousal couldn't have been any more obvious. Be honest with yourself about your identity for once. AGP doesn't invalidate it. For some reason, I'm not going to ban you. But if you argue against AGP or project it onto women again, I will.

And the women in those two articles are isolated cases. EXCEPTIONS ARE NOT THE NORM. They may have something resembling AGP, but it isn't comparable. Some women actually do have something very similar to AGP. It's called autoandrophilia (arousal to the idea of being a man) and quite a few FTMs appear to have it. You obviously have never read any of the literature on AGP and are only parroting what your echo chamber has told you."

""Exceptions are not the norm"" is exactly the same point I was making, if you read my comment, but I'd be more likely to say that *your* experience in this case is the exception. But I don't see why you think you know better than the voices of the majority of trans people whose experiences don't align with yours. It borders on conspiracy theorist territory, when you insist that somehow the majority of trans people are lying in a collective desire to fool the public.

Everybody's trans experience is individual to them. Yours may be autogynephilic, but there are thousands who haven't had that same experience. I can honestly say that I have never been aroused just by the thought of having a woman's body. There is nothing for me to ""accept"", because my experience is entirely different from yours.

Interestingly, I was given a copy of ""The Man who would be Queen"", by my naïve aunt last year, and I did actually end up reading it, because I'm interested in learning about the other side of the story. I can't say it was an enjoyable read, but it certainly gave another perspective to consider - which, after consideration, I have found to be poorly representative.

And I'd rather leave than stay, to be honest, I'm not interested in commenting here any more. I'll go back to my echo chamber.

Nah, transvestism is still a quite common path to transsexualism and my experience fits the [typical developmental path of transvestism](http://www.tbuckner.com/TRANSVES.HTM).

Anne Lawrence's representation of AGP is much less stigmatizing and much more consistent with the experiences of MtF transsexuals. I'd suggest you check out her work if you are ever interested in learning more on the subject. I actually think the she way conceptualizes AGP in her ""[Becoming What We Love](http://www.annelawrence.com/becoming_what_we_love.pdf)"" paper is a beautiful way to understand our cross-gender desires."

He once felt he wanted to transition into a woman. I have zero doubt he would have bought himself crap like this.

When the definition of a woman becomes more based on tacky outfits and stupid fetishes, our reality as biological women ceases to be at all relevant, which is why they justify their anger at ""TERFs"" and preserving nonsense like this, while our righteous anger is deemed transphobic. Astonishing."

- leave semen behind in the changing room, because of that erection and jerk off sesh, sorry oops I mean “gender euphoria”, which inevitably follows trying on skirts
- steal their sisters/moms underwear and jerk off in them. 
All 3 of these examples I have seen documented in this sub.  

... OPs post *is* problematic. It shows that TiMs are only interested in dressing as “women” insofar as their warped, caricatured, overly sexualised version of it allows. Real women do not wear fetish wear outside, but TIMs do.

4087,crazyangryfemale,"I never understood this argument. You’re telling me that having a man intentionally prolapse a woman’s anus to derive sexual pleasure from it is okay because that woman consented to it? Even though that will have severe repercussions for her body for the rest of her life? If you’re indifferent, that’s one thing. But let’s not file this under “its consensual so it’s harming no one.” When it comes to porn, and the acts then copied in real life, very few people are left unharmed by that. Whether in a literal sense or a broader sense—like how “mommy”/“daddy” kinks can be arguably harmful for children because it simulates a child-parent relationship and degenerates it by making it sexual. This has had real effects on children and real effects on both men and women. This is not just theoretical bullshit. “This can be harmful but other things can be harmful too” what are you talking about? Yeah, and we should talk about those things too. Alcohol is absolutely abused and has caused too many early deaths. Why take focus away from the harm that’s being done here because you don’t think it’s as bad? The thing is—yeah, people who want to cause bodily harm to others intentionally to derive sexual pleasure are not normal. I’m not going to say it’s normal; it’s not. It’s either the result of addiction through porn which warps sexuality, or the result of abuse which can also warp understanding of sexuality. I personally understand both. Trauma has destroyed my sexuality, and I’m a drug addict; I know how addiction affects the brain. But there are also just men who are narcissistic, abusive, or socio-/psychopathic who enjoy hurting women. What’s the benefit of telling THOSE men that their desire to hurt women for sexual pleasure is good and okay? Im not going to be cruel about it, but I’m not going to be indifferent or sweep it away so coldly because I can’t be bothered to care that real people are being hurt by this. We’re way past the point of this being used as an excuse anymore, if it ever was a sufficient one in the first place.

Etc etc. and then others might just partake in these things and still be able to enjoy life and not just sit around constantly watching porn or jacking off, I think it’s rather narrow minded to paint every single person who might enjoy these things as some freak addict in a basement setting out candy to trap others into their evil lair.

I just don’t truly see how it’s my business nor in what way do I have any right in telling adult consenting people what to do w their bodies. Even if it’s about porn addiction and wanting to try things one has seen in porn. If both parties are down, I don’t see why I should judge. I’m not here to police people’s sexual choices.

Even if it was true that all vaginas were magic, there isn't good enough medical science to give these guys a real vagina.

Just a hole that can get infections easily. Their only real hole is their ass. If you ask most men what would they prefer, fucking a real woman's vagina or a makeshift hole and an ass, they'd choose the real vagina. I doubt the ass feels half as good as a real vagina."

4230,throwaway275445,"Reminds me of Umberto Eco's essay on fascism. 

*""The first feature of Ur-Fascism is the cult of tradition. Traditionalism is of course much older than fascism. Not only was it typical of counter-revolutionary Catholic thought after the French revolution, but it was born in the late Hellenistic era, as a reaction to classical Greek rationalism. In the Mediterranean basin, people of different religions (most of them indulgently accepted by the Roman Pantheon) started dreaming of a revelation received at the dawn of human history. This revelation, according to the traditionalist mystique, had remained for a long time concealed under the veil of forgotten languages – in Egyptian hieroglyphs, in the Celtic runes, in the scrolls of the little known religions of Asia.
This new culture had to be syncretistic. Syncretism is not only, as the dictionary says, “the combination of different forms of belief or practice”; such a combination must tolerate contradictions. Each of the original messages contains a silver of wisdom, and whenever they seem to say different or incompatible things it is only because all are alluding, allegorically, to the same primeval truth.
As a consequence, there can be no advancement of learning. Truth has been already spelled out once and for all, and we can only keep interpreting its obscure message.
One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements. The most influential theoretical source of the theories of the new Italian right, Julius Evola, merged the Holy Grail with The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, alchemy with the Holy Roman and Germanic Empire. The very fact that the Italian right, in order to show its open-mindedness, recently broadened its syllabus to include works by De Maistre, Guenon, and Gramsci, is a blatant proof of syncretism.
If you browse in the shelves that, in American bookstores, are labeled as New Age, you can find there even Saint Augustine who, as far as I know, was not a fascist. But combining Saint Augustine and Stonehenge – that is a symptom of Ur-Fascism.""*

4361,vangogh-thot,"I had a few friends come over to stay once when I was in sixth grade. We were having fun playing video games and stuff and out of nowhere my one friend who now identifies as a trans man piped up, “since we’re all girls... how hairy is yours?” And wouldn’t stop pestering us about showing off our “beavers” all night. 

She didn’t come back to my house after that."
4362,RedditIsFullOfSoy,"No. Men do not see each other's dick a lot. I was in a locker rooms as an athlete for many years. I can remember ONE guy in 8 years who walked around naked and he was fucking crazy. Coach made him stop too. Everyone else gets their shit on and off as fast as possible. If there was time to kill, like after school but before a game, we hung out in our school issues shorts, not in jock straps or towels like you'd see in lighthearted football movies. For the most part, you're actually on a changing time crunch because coaches want you on the field to practice, not playing grab ass in the locker room. 

I honestly don't think I've ever seen a penis IRL that wasn't in my family. Even then it is extenuating circumstances like having to help my brother who had broken his leg bathe or when he got wasted and puked all over himself so we stripped him naked and he slept in the bathtub. Now I have a son who is under 2 and I of course change his diaper and bathe him often. 

As far as toilets go... that's a good way to start a fight. I know I would be pretty upset if the guy next to me went out of his way to look at my dick. We don't just whip them out and keep them out as soon as we cross the threshold to the bathroom."

Projection and a lack of socialization. If you're an incel and your entire existence consists of playing videogames and jerking off, you get this idea in your head that life would be beautiful if you could just find that special girl who's also into videogames and sex. 

Instead of developing self awareness and realizing *""hmmm, maybe I should cut down on the masturbation and videogames""*, they just start dating each other."

Never in my entire life of being a woman (and one in a sorority, at that lmao) and being around women have we taken our tops off and compared breasts."
4380,Ergative_Absolutive,"I imagine it's pretty common for girls to mentally compare their breast size to their friends' breast size, because teenagerhood is all about being painfully self-conscious about the ways your body is changing and the ways you're different from your peers. But actually holding your breasts next to your friend's breasts and seeing whose are bigger . . . I'm not going to claim no teenage girls have ever done this, but it's really, really not a standard girlhood experience. And comparing ""clitty"" sizes is just not a thing. At all. Although maybe it's normal *male* behavior, because we all know that ""clitty"" means ""dick"" here."

4414,angrybroad,No.
4415,TheGreatWhoDeeny,"What a degenerate.

I think I'm one of the few boys who got to go to one of these slumber parties. This was in the summer of 1986. It was me, the girl I had a crush on, her younger sister, and a few other girls at our apartments.

What did we do?

Her mom went to Foster Farms(local restaurant like KFC in the 80s) and got us BBQ chicken and spuds, rented us a couple scary movies, and my contribution was bringing a bag of Now n Laters, Jolly Ranchers, and chick o sticks.

We talked and listened to the radio in their bedroom, played the board game Life, had dinner, watched those movies, watched MTV, and I think they fell asleep around midnight. I slept on the couch and watched TV until I fell asleep. I woke up around 6 am or so, went to their mom's room, and told her I was leaving. I walked back to my apartment.

Notice what was missing from this story? Your sick fantasies. Even with a boy in the equation, a boy who at 11 had sex on the brain and dealing with a foot fetish, nothing happened.

Any time I hear songs like Robert Palmer's Addicted to Love, Peter Catera's Glory of Love, I think of those times.

Your pedo fantasies do not match the realities of these parties."
4416,ResponsibleCharacter,"What the fuck. Just cause you fantasize about female children having “first sexual experiences” together doesn’t make it true. You are disgusting. We played video games, ate candy, rode bikes. Went to the park, watched movies at night, had popcorn and soda. 

I had sleepovers that includdd girls who later came out as lesbian and there still wasn’t any kissing or sexual experiences because we were fucking KIDS. 

Stop fetishizing female children. Stop. Stop. Stay away from little girls."

I remember, not from personal experience, but from my sister's friend, that she was goaded into watching hentai and talking explicitly sexual things with her friend, and she still goes to therapy for it. They were both girls, around the age of 13 iirc.

So I can also confirm that, no, it's not normal for childhood sleepovers."

So a lesbian orgy is not lesbianism? What?

And ah, so ""slumber parties"" ""max out"" at 14 - what does that even mean lol? So they're later called something else or what? Cause you know, it keeps happening at older ages too, regular sleepovers or orgies especially, so yeah what a confused argument lol

> Little girl orgies only exist in twisted male fantasies.

Many people already commit sin at 14 or even younger, so I'm not sure who you're trying to convince with this nonsense lol - however the weird OP didn't even say anything about 14, so you're really confused about everything here lolmao"

The difference is the chances of this woman getting harassing messages is not low, it's high. A small number of men doing the behaviour does not mean a small risk for the woman. The chance of your buddy getting false-rape-accused or whatever is fucking miniscule.

Any man who can read a comment like that from one woman to another and his primary emotional response isn't empathy for the women but butthurt about his own ego, is exactly the kind of man who is the problem.

Now, some women can get hyperemesis gravidarium. What that essentially means is while a baby is inside my wife she is nauseous, vomiting 3-4 times a day, for the past 7.5 months. Nothing has helped her, and all she is, is miserable.

I'm trying to think about what specifically pisses me off about it, and the best way to describe it is that women say that shit to each other, I feel like we can define what that looks like to each other even though there's no criteria, and we mean it as a compliment, (some use as an) insult, or joking around... But from a man, it is unequivocally never ever anything but a huge judgement based on their definition of what a ""slut"" looks like, and it's always related to how they can probably slither their way into our beds, why they should ""stay away from"" us, and often a ""justification"" (whether it's said outright or implied) for sexual assault. And that justification permeates society to the point where ""what were you wearing?"" is an actual question women and girls are asked after a sexual assault, totally blaming the victim. And here this motherfucker is using it as something fun and freeing, when the rest of us have to think about where we're going, who's going to be there, who to stay away from, where our girls in our group are at all times, because dressing ""slutty"" carries a lot of risk. Not to mention, the consideration and reconsideration as to whether we do ""look"" slutty, and asking our friends ""do I look like a slut? Is my skirt too short?"", which is entirely subjective, but it's still considered a bad thing. They don't get to have a positive attitude toward looking like a slut, when they are the reason we have to pause hard to enjoy the same feelings"

Yup. If it was the latter, you'd see the occasional reasonable outfit. I don't know women's fashion well, but I know enough to see one hell of a variety -- my woman's closet is evidence enough. And despite all this variety of outfits and styles, what do TiMs pick? The valentine's day lingerie. Something slutty/trashy so that if it wasn't for the linebacker shoulders and lantern jaw, you would think ""yes this is a cheaper hooker."" 

It's never normal clothes. Never professional attire. It's always that cheesy bedroom gimmick shit. That has a time and place, but you can't wear just that and expect to be taken seriously.

4750,random_ass_girl,"No definitely not. I meant more in the context of, like me telling my best friend ""omg you look so slutty, love it!"" When she is feeling herself and showing off some of her fabulous self. But I've never really heard any actual woman be be like ""I dress like a slut"". In my experience, women use it with each other situationally, and although the definition (whatever that is) has definitive roots directly based on sexism and patriarchal standards, it's still something some women use with each other but (usually) don't mean it in a judgey or offensive way. To hear a man be proud of looking that way is infuriating. Like I said, I cannot quite verbalize my feelings right on that word and the way it's used, but I do know that it's not ok for a man to proud of this, when they'll never have to suffer the consequences of it. Also, young girls are always taught not to dress ""slutty"" by their parents, dress codes in schools outline what girls can't wear, and their examples always insinuate what may be considered a ""slutty"" outfit. The list is usually long, and incredibly restrictive, and so many times, girls get in trouble for something inappropriate at school because one teacher thinks something is too tight, or too short, etc, whereas others wouldn't. Girls who develop early might always look ""slutty"" no matter what they wear, because compared to their peers, the clothes simply fit differently, which isn't their fault. I remember when I was young, I was tall and thin, grew like a maniac for a while, but settled down after like 10th grade. During the time I was maybe 15-17, every dress I wore was really short, because my waist size was ""typical"" for my age, but my height wasn't. All the pants were tight because although I wasn't all that tall, I was super thin, and usually the really small waist sizes come with really long inseams. My mom used to say ""you're probably gonna get in trouble for wearing that, but just tell the principal that you can't help growing, that everything is going to make you look slutty and ask him if he wants you to wear pajamas every day, because that's against the dress code too"". So for me, being a woman now allows us to own that word, define it for ourselves and use it positively because we've gone through the process of it being the first thing we think of before we leave as a bad thing. To hear a man be proud of it, without the exhausting experience with what that word means and how it can define a whole woman negatively makes me mad; they haven't earned any right to say it in any way"

And as always he’s jealous of her name. To top it off he truly believes he’s being bullied. As if he isn’t a step away from a sex offender by jerking it in his sisters stolen worn undies. Fuck him. May he always look like a river troll in drag. So predictable.

The entire attraction to it is the *knowledge* that you're not supposed to like it. It's a story as old as time- people will be drawn to things for no reason other than that they're not supposed to like it. 


If not that, then they *are* just mentally deficient. There's nothing morally, ethically or logically consistent about wanting to form a sexual relationship with a relative so that you can bring an inbred child with a strong genetic predisposition for a host of problems into the world. 


A very simple ethical instrument is to simply ask yourself what would happen if *everyone* did it. Logically, if everyone did it and the human race suffered no ill effects, it's probably not *that* bad from an ethical standpoint. If everyone did it and it caused problems, it's probably unethical.


Now realize that if everyone engaged in incest it'd trigger an extinction event. Anyone who takes it beyond, 'tee hee I loved Game of Thrones!' or 'well duh, it's not like I'm *actually* going to do it' is probably mentally unstable. Or outright sociopathic. A major reason incest is illegal in most of the US is because of how frequently it dovetails with an inherently abusive relationship across generations. It's not typically cousins fucking, it's often the abusive uncle or the mother who's turned their son into their new husband. Which is to say, it's rape."

4919,The_Mushromancer,"Your last paragraph is, like, half of all relationships in human history.

In ancient history, humanity was mostly small tribes. You hooking up with your cousin was pretty much the norm. Brother sister stuff wasn’t uncommon, you did what you had to do to bear a child, since that was basically your duty (if you were a woman) to grow the group. Many tribes had some fucked up traditions too, like one in Africa or maybe Aboriginal Australia (I think, can’t remember the name and I really don’t want to google this) had the tradition that when a girl had her first period, and was therefore fertile, she would be impregnated by her _grandfather_ to pass on his genes.

As these tribes became settled civilizations, cousin-fucking was still the norm but direct father/daughter/mother/son/brother/sister became less common because it was less “necessary” and the group was much larger, so you had more options. But family ties and arranged marriages were ubiquitous. Though incestuous rape was still _extremely_ common. Like, heart-breakingly so. 

Even up until the modern era, first or second cousin marriages were super, super common. Most people lived in what we would consider now to be rural communities. We all make fun of Alabama because it still does that. 

So your 3rd paragraph about what if _everyone_ did it doesn’t really stand, because, well, for most of human history, pretty much everyone _did_ do it. First cousin marriages weren’t even something to bat an eye at until 150 or so years ago. Nowadays that’s pretty taboo. 

Make no mistake, I’m not advocating for incest. And thinking back on how things used to be, especially from the perspective of adolescent girls, is pretty sad. I’m mainly just trying to say that, before the information era, incest was a _lot_ more common than most people want to believe.

But real quick, a note about inbreeding and why incest wasn’t as detrimental as we imagine. If you don’t care about genetics and don’t want to read anymore about incest, you can just stop here.

———————

Incest itself doesn’t actually have any negative effects. The inbreeding issue arises from the fact that most people have some negative mutations or alleles in their genomes. And siblings probably all have that copy from a parent. But if you only have one bad copy, it’s generally fine. The problem with incest is, if these bad genes are present, the chance an incestuous child gets 2 copies of the shit genes skyrockets because both parents had a copy, while random mating drastically lowers the chance both parents have a copy of the bad gene.

And as humanity advances technologically, shit genes aren’t filtered out as much because we have the medical skill and social obligation to care for and help these people. So the risk of inbreeding issues from incest rise as people accumulate more and more potentially bad genes. Just think of all the people with glasses nowadays. Bad sight genes are no longer a detriment because we can mitigate the effects.

But, in theory, if you had a couple of genetically “pristine” siblings who had no negative genes, including silent single pair mutations, these two could create an incest chain forever until natural mutation rate caused spontaneous issues. 

In other species, like crops and pets and work animals such as horses, our strongest specimens were usually _incredibly_ inbred, because we selected for good traits and then bred them with the parents who had the traits, then mated those offspring until the desired traits were very strongly represented. 

———————

I’m sorry for writing so much about a taboo topic. The first half was just historical clarification and as a biochemist I kinda felt the urge to mention that “inbreeding isn’t inherently genetically detrimental”  for the second half.

But in the end, human incest is still morally wrong."

That‘s not a very useful tool. Left handelndes developed precisely because not everyone had it. That is to say, the advantage of left handedness lies in being a minority trait. 

Similarly, incest isn‘t a problem as long as long as it‘s not exclusively practiced. Cousins marrying cousins is a practice as old as time, and didn‘t cause issues. Until the European royals took it too far my practicing it exclusively. Direct relatives carry considerate risk form the get go, though.

How much does treatment of the neurodevelopmental disorders rely on other people playing along?

Birth rate in the west is declining and infant mortality rate is also declining (even babies with atypical development can survive in the west), it means that there is accumulation of people with atypical brain in the western community and changes in the laws regarding social integration of weird people reflect that fact.

4930,FlatCommunication1," First cousin marriages in Pakistani communities leading to 'appalling' disabilities among children

Baroness Flather, a cross-bench peer, says it is 'absolutely appalling' that    first cousin marriages in Pakistani communities are leading to 'so much    disability among children'   

Couples who are getting married should be  forced to have a DNA test first to ensure they are not cousins amid  growing concern about [incest within Pakistani communities](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/7957808/700-children-born-with-genetic-disabilities-due-to-cousin-marriages-every-year.html), Britain's first Asian peer has claimed. 

 Baroness Flather, a former Tory who now sits as a cross-bencher, said  in the House of Lords that it is ""absolutely appalling"" that first  cousin marriages in Pakistani communities are leading to ""so much  disability among children"". 

She  said: ""There are a lot of first-cousin marriages in certain communities,  particularly among Pakistanis who come from the Pakistani Kashmir area.  We know so much about DNA now, but there is so much disability among  the children, which is absolutely appalling. 

 ""You go to any such family and there will be four or five children, at  least one or two of whom will have some disability. That is absolutely  unacceptable, and if we cannot do anything about it, is it fair to the  children?"" 

Baroness Flather, a  former barrister who was born in the Pakistani city of Lahore when it  was part of India, said: ""Never mind the parents — it is not fair to the  children that they should be allowed to become disabled because of a  social practice. It is a social practice which does not belong in  today’s age, when we know so much about DNA. There should at least be  some rule which says that you must have a DNA examination before your  marriage can be registered."" 

 First-cousin marriages, which are are legal in the UK, are practised  within Britain’s Pakistani community, as well as among some Arab and  African families.[  Medical data previously suggested that while British Pakistanis were  responsible for 3 per cent of all births, they accounted for 30 per cent  of British children born with a genetic illness](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/4014743/Warning-over-births-to-first-cousin-marriages.html)."
4931,,"I don't see that there is an inherent mechanism that would cause this, rather than just a saturating of the whole gene pool (the family) with the same faulty genes.

Like breeding for a trait in dogs."
4932,FlatCommunication1,"&#x200B;

I'm afraid AGP being a neurodevelopmental disorder has to be proven, Nor are individuals with autism allowed to commit sexual harassment because it affirms their identity. [In 2005 in the US , a convicted murderer tried to avoid  execution by claiming his ""warrior genes"" caused him to commit the crime and that he wasn't responsible for it, but it didn't go well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Anthony_Mobley)

I don't consider not suppressing disabled children on par with sanctioning a man's misappropriation  of what being female is like   -  I think only a very self-loathing  man or a hyperbolic trans activist would say that.

>Feminists try to explain current social dynamics by some conspiracy against women. I think the problem is more deeper.

I agree to an extent, but the nonchalance with women have been trampled to uplift a subset of men and their sexual fixations to the point of defunding shelters has got to put an end to ""male = expendable, woman = valuable"" canards for good (unless it's an emotional belief, of course). Reminder about female infanticide and [human trafficking.](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/01/1029912)

Just because you're valued for your use doesn't mean your needs and desires are considered at all. I thought that was why men complained about the draft (which hasn't existed in most Western countries for quite a while), why workers have to negotiate working conditions instead of getting treated humanely from the get-go, or, conversely, why lesbians complain about the cotton ceiling."
4933,sunkenrocks,"indeed, of course. but to my understanding, while it is MUCH more dangerous than a regular conception for the child, it's 2+ generations of inbreeding where suppression of problem genes becomes more and more pronounced."

>I'm afraid AGP being a neurodevelopmental disorder has to be proven

Do you think that normal males without developmental problems can develop AGP?  I don't consider atypical sexual interest due to porn escalation as a paraphilia.

>And the criteria has been diluted to meaninglessness, like many mental health diagnosis apparently (such is the state of psychology today)

Yeah, diagnostic critera are fuzzy, nevertheless there is a trend towards deinstitutionalization  of the psychiatry. It means that a lot of people with atypical brain and psyche live in the general community.  My point is that   society needs to  ""play along""  to some degree  with such people if we decided to integrate them into society, also there is   accumulation of such  people in the western countries.  Also i don't confuse social integration with granting of special rights. Autistic agp doesn't  have a  special right to chase women, but he has a right to receive hormonal treatment and wear appropriate female clothes (not fetish gear) in social settings if he likes to do it.  It is my  humble opinion and vision, i don't pretend that it is right."

Yaniv is a sadist who gets sexual gratification from forcing women to play with his dick. 

Yaniv has figured out that as a male, he cannot force a prostitute to play with his dick, and if that's what he's into, he'll have to pay good money for a professional. And let's be realistic here, even prostitutes would turn down a guy like that.

5099,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"A friend of mine works at a hospital, in a different role, and she tells me the exact same stories. And all of this is very recent; I've known her for ages and she never dealt with this ten years ago.

5106,macaroniinapan,"That's pretty much what he wanted from the salon workers.  To wax body parts they weren't trained to wax.  But you can bet, if one had tried but messed up and caused injury, he would have sued the shit out of her."
5107,leparsdon,"he doesn't even have that, he's pre-op"
5108,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"> How is a gynocologist supposed to do anything for a transgender person

1) 70.3 % of gynecology students are women

2) Yaniv likes forcing women to play with his dick and balls

The Canadian taxpayers are basically funding Yaniv's sexual fantasies. 

A lot of TiMs remind me of the MGTOW movement. These are guys who figured out that they can stop working, play videogames all day and jerk off all night, and the taxpayers will foot the bill."
5109,LeishaCamden,"Not true though, I have seen videos. Him speaking to a council meeting or something, in a red velvet dress. 🙄 Him saying shit about an immigrant who was sitting literally next to him. Him in his mobility scooter that he scammed the taxpayers out of, flipping out at a journalist ... at least two of those.

All of this I have seen with my eyes, which I would now like to carve out of my head and burn. Unfortunately that would be pointless as the images are seared into my brain."

5111,leparsdon,"his last lawsuit went nowhere for the same reasons. ""He wasn't discriminated against because these businesses don't normally wax dicks and balls""

I imagine this lawsuit will be the same, since gynecologists don't service male patients."

5113,WraithOfEvaBraun,"Ikr, imagine indeed!

It's absolutely bloody infuriating! Wasting time *and* money...I can't even!

The self-pity this cretin oozes is absolutely sickening...the hardships he's facing he's brought on his damn self!"
5114,motion_lotion,"I'm in endo. It's what every TiM patient does. They just want a lawsuit, a fight, to feel oppressed... some sort of drama. The female to male are pure medical and straight to business. The TiMs are so damn time consuming it greatly impacts my ability to interact with other patients due to how much time they consume, how difficult they are and how much liability we face. I frequently leave the room to consult with colleagues extensively to figure out the best way to respond to simple questions without being vulnerable to lawsuits or offending their fragile egos."
5115,Melony-Piper,When i was an intern in a hospital as part of my paramedic training the general rule of thumb was for waiting people in the ER “If they have the ability to complain they have nothing to complain about.” And i find that also applies to a lot of “regular” patients

They're a bunch of entitled fucks and I despise it."
5131,revolvernyacelot,its because many mtf’s idea of women is a histronic mess and not a human being
5132,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"> And oddly enough the female to male patients simply want advice with testosterone and estrogen blockers, no drama, no problems. Amazing how it works, isn't it?

5138,crispycherrypie,It’s not great for the women he’s sexually harassing.
5139,2or3thingsIknow,In Canada everything is free for them. All their surgeries. Meanwhile the elderly are left in substandard homes with shrinking money. All allocated to the tiny percentage of trans and the newly trans criminals being put in with women prisoners.
5140,lemon-rind,In the US Medicaid and Medicare are required to cover the surgeries as well as any other plan that receives federal funding like Tricare.
5141,featherdino,"Yeah, I know- In the thread he’s suggesting gynos be the ones doing mtf cosmetic genital surgery. It’s insane. I couldn’t even touch on the complete idiocy of having a gyno examine dick and balls so I didn’t"

I mean you didn't study for years to deal with this crap, tiptoeing around for fear of losing your career!

There's not much makes me really mad these days but *this* type of nonsense has me *spitting mad*"

I'd never try any of disgusting and predatory Johnny Yanniv's act though even if a lot of money was involved...Cannot even imagine doing something like that with a straight face, he should be locked up."
5150,crustdrunk,Probably. Also Jonathan still has his dick and I doubt this will change ever

5160,macaroniinapan,"Come to think of it, I don't actually know either.  I do know that while it's rare, regular cis men CAN get breast cancer, but I don't know how that's detected."
5161,motion_lotion,"Ditto. I've always seen about 90% of TiMs as failed men -- many constantly mention how being a woman in western society is living life on ""easy mode."" It's fucking delusional, but I run into this attitude quite frequently. I'm not even gonna speculate on female to male, but my experience so far has been no different than the regular population and overwhelmingly positive."
5162,Not_My_Real_Acct_,That's been my experience too.
5163,motion_lotion,"Agreed. It seems their definition of femininity is either some caricature of degrading porn or exactly what you said. I'm not going to pretend to know what being a real woman is like, but I know it sure as hell is not whatever TiMs define it as."
5164,motion_lotion,"No, I'm a man, but I think you're definitely on to something. TiMs are faaaaar more aggressive with women. They're a pain in the ass with me, but it's more of an entitled ""I can do your job better than you, give me everything I demand and if you don't coddle me you're getting sued"" type of attitude. With women, it's more predatory and overtly sexual. They seem to take a sick pleasure in making women uncomfortable hence why I am completely dedicated to keeping them out of female safe spaces. For folks who talk a big game about wanting to be women, they sure seem to treat real women like trash."
5165,athiestgoddess,Dear god i hope not
5166,Espressopatronumjoe,"Of course not. But they are doing this shit in private. Threatening our safety, ability to say ""no"" and us and them knowing they can cry ""transphobe"" and we lose our jobs, friends, status. So we have to secretly meet on subs and commiserate amongst ourselves with no one else paying attention. 

Finally it's being out in the open so everyone else can see it besides us radfems. 

The harassment has been happening. He is just making it public. That's good. People believe males. Not women. So they will see this and believe that this is happening regularly... Because a man is proudly saying it."
5167,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"> In Canada everything is free for them. All their surgeries. Meanwhile the elderly are left in substandard homes with shrinking money.

I used to work with a dude who was a productive programmer, and well regarded in the community. He transitioned male-to-female. Shortly after, he was out of work. I think it's safe to assume his employer figured out a way to get rid of him. He was customer-facing, and that's got to be a difficult thing to explain.

Nowadays they spend all their time blogging about how they *""were always a woman""* and about videogames. Considering how long they've been out-of-work, I think it's safe to assume they got themselves on permanent disability for some reason or another, and they're going to spend the rest of their lives doing nothing, while my tax dollars pay for it.

The depressing thing isn't just that I pay for their lifestyle. It's also that this was a productive and smart person, who's now spending 24x7 on videogames and blogging. 

And I **love** videogames. I'd love to do that too. But I wouldn't feel right, taking money from everyone else, because my fetish was more important than anything else in the world."
5168,FrightfulTerrence,That's absolutely abhorrent
5169,leparsdon,It's a mystery
5170,,also the video where he blocks a car and pretends it's trying to hit him lol
5171,motion_lotion,"Thank you, it means a lot and you are correct: that is not what I studied for. Unfortunately, I'm the youngest and lowest on the totempole here, so I am stuck with the TiM patients. We don't share: they always go to the least veteran doc present. I'm hoping as I gain experience/seniority or branch out into private practice, I can find a way to avoid them."
5172,MoreSpikes,Wonder how much of the crowd here is the medical crowd who actually has to deal with all this bullshit face-to-face.
5173,WraithOfEvaBraun,"Hopefully before long he will be locked up*...he's an absolute menace 😡

I'd have to check, (not 100% sure) but if he kept pulling that crap here there's a thing called vexatious litigation...idk if it would apply to him though...possibly not seeing as he's a 'protected class' 🙄

ETA: * but I suppose even in *that* situation it would be a case of...what prison does he go to???"

5178,2or3thingsIknow,"They wish to drop out of manhood and claim womanhood by doing so. In this way they can claim to be more oppressed than actual women. I have no idea what motivates these creeps to go to these lengths to escape manhood. There is nothing he will actually really gain except pain, loneliness and isolation. Shoving themselves into spaces he will never belong in and pretending to be something he will never be. Really odd they do this. Mental illness."

5186,WraithOfEvaBraun,"True, but judging by his last sojourn in a womens prison, the seg would be even more so for the protection of the other women 

What absolute scum! I will *never* consent to these animals being in my changing rooms or washrooms - if that makes me a 'bigot', then so bloody be it"
5187,WraithOfEvaBraun,"You could be right it seems quite confusing (I looked up Canada but not being Canadian, my brain melted 😂 )

I found this for UK

*Courts in England and Wales have the means of escalating the sanctions against a litigant who makes applications to the court that are ""totally without merit"".[27] *

Other definitions stated 'without merit' or 'unlikely to be successful'

What Yaniv is doing *SHOULD* fall under that in any sane world but - our world is no longer sane

Whatever, a court certainly decided he wasn't demanding his sack wax lol"
5188,aquariumbitch,Never. Not even when they start killing women.
5189,macaroniinapan,"I would like to think that the first time he behaved inappropriately towards an actual female prisoner, that would put a target on his back and the rest would make him regret it.  But there's no guarantee, of course. But even if they all just ignored him, I'm sure he'd consider that torture."
5190,sunkenrocks,Yes sadly checks and balances don't apply to some.

My wife was talking about this yesterday. About how she sees tons of women her age, who basically have no motivation to get married or have a boyfriend. She argued that women have generally pursued partners who were in a financial position that's equal or better than them. 

And with so many men stuck in this rut of videogames and porn, women simply aren't motivated to commit.

I have a friend who was about the same age, and ten years ago she was married. Her marriage ended about nine years ago. Since the end of her marriage, her income has tripled. (She used to be in the military and now works in the private sector.) She's cycled through a series of boyfriends over the last ten years, there's always someone new every year. And I wonder if this will just go on indefinitely, because she's never dated *anyone* who's made even half of what she makes. Last time I talked to her, she was complaining that she wanted to go on vacation but her boyfriend couldn't afford to pay for half, and she wasn't going to cover it.

Anyways...I took it to heart and followed its advice to the letter.

Other than checking out some Playboy and Penthouse mags when I was a kid, a few videos as a teen, and some foot fetish videos a few years back, I've stayed away from it and it completely blows my mind how mainstream it is now.

As a teenager, I *desperately* wanted a GF. I tried all the things that seemed obvious to me, such as working out and getting a cool car. I went clubbing a lot, but the best I could do was get a phone number or two, I never got a single date, not even one.

One night a coworker of mine went with me to the club, and gave me some LSD. *Totally changed my life.* It was the first time I'd gone to a club and I wasn't obsessing over ""looking cool"" or ""getting numbers."" I basically went from being a thirsty nerd who was aggressively picking up on women, to someone who was just at the club to dance and have a good time and burn off some energy. 

Literally overnight, I started to attract women. All I had to do was stop trying so hard and relax and stop being such a fucking autistic spaz."

5432,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"I'm no doctor, but here's my take:

*Sometimes bad trips can be better than good trips.*

Here's an example:

One time I had a bad LSD trip, and about two hours into it, I felt like I was going to die and the trip was never going to end.

The weird thing about hallucinogenics is that they can deliver an experience that's similar to a REAL near death experience. Basically your brain can't tell the difference between a REAL near death experience and an imagined one.

For instance, everyone has met someone who had a heart attack in their 40s, and who suddenly changed their lifestyle because of it. Kevin Smith is an obvious example; he lost about 100lbs after his near death experience.

Hallucinogens can do that too.

Ketamine is supposedly the best for doing that. 

Also, I've never had a bad mushroom trip."

Now I'm disgusted and sincerely worried for this child and I know I can't do anything about it.

Also I have a cousin who grew up with a dad who became trans in the 80s before it was even well known and it was horrible for her.  She has to accept it for her own sanity but it caused her a lot of trauma and she had to mourn her own father while he was still alive."

5463,winters_frost,">Any and all criticisms of the trans community is met with vehement opposition. As though they are beyond reproach and negative actions.

The transcult and its SJW allies like to counter this point by saying ""Every group has its shitty person. Does every black, woman, or gay person have to apologize for every black, woman, or gay person that does something shitty? Why do we have to apologize for every shitty trans person?""

The reason why this analogy doesn't work is because the horrible things that those groups of people do aren't attempted to justified by the fact that they did it **because** they were black, female, gay, etc. We don't say that black people get a pass to do terrible things because they're black and/or cause they were oppressed by slavery. We don't get to say that gay people get a pass to do terrible things because they're gay, and that gays have been historically oppressed and executed. And so on.

But these shitty things that trans people do, are done **because** of the fact that they're trans. A gay person doesn't get to go on a temper tantrum with violent disorderly conduct just cause someone calls him a \[bundle of sticks\], nor does a black person get to do so if someone calls him a \[n-word\], but ""IT'S MA'AM!"" guy gets a free pass at disorderly conduct because someone called him ""sir"", and the leftist liberal SJWs praise him as stunning and brave for doing so.

And its the same here. SJWs say this TIM gets a free pass to wear slutty hooker clothes in front of children **because he's trans** and he's just ""going through his second puberty."" No black, gay, woman, etc. etc. person tries to justify their actions because of them being an oppressed minority, but the transcult literally does it all the time. And the majority of the transcult doesn't give a fuck; in fact they actually **support** this because it's the same transcult ideology that they use to coerce society into giving them special privileges like being able to use whichever bathroom they ""feel"" like and wearing slutty hooker clothes in front of children, which they call ""basic human rights""."

These relatives are in mourning over an individual who this new individual took away from them, often with no notice or anything. I think this explains a lot of the issues that go on after someone becomes a TIM or TIF. They want to be accepted just like nothing ever happened and don´t acknowledge how big a deal this is for their own parents. And it must be way worse and more difficult to handle for little kids."

His parents got divorced and his father moved away for work so his mother was granted custody.

5471,,Sadly most of the anglosphere aren’t reasonable countries
5472,jigglylinda,"I work in a children's hospital in a sub-specialty with very, very sick children. We have a patient who is a little girl with a TIF for a mother and a TIM for a father.  The mother decided that when the girl was around 4 uears old, she could no longer call her ""mom"", but instead had to call her ""papa"". At the the time her TIM father had not yet transitioned. The poor little girl found this very upsetting and confusing...that her mother would no longer be ""mommy"" but instead, was her ""father"". 

When her actual father decided to transition a year or so later, and she was told to call him ""mom"", she of course had a lot of issues and struggled to do so. She would tell our nurses and doctors how upset this made her. Well after that, her TIM father would openly act like he had no interest in her medical care or helping to solve her chronic conditions at appointments. Openly admitting to her doctor that if she couldn't respect his identity, he no longer had interest in helping with her healthcare and debilitating pain. 

Luckily, the doctor who is our department chief is a ""TERF"", and doesn't believe in trans ideology. She called DCF, the parents were investigated and a social worker started coming to their home regularly. 

Fast forward to a few months later, and the same TIM is in our clinic with a different little girl and a different TIF spouse. Not surprisingly, these TIMs and TIFs in this story are all poly. But this time, the TIM father is all happy and interested in the second little girl's healthcare because she's calling him ""mom"" without any obvious issues. The last I heard about a few weeks ago, was that DCF took all kids away from the trans poly parents. Which leads me to believe stuff outside of the confusing labels was going on since DCF is likely to side with trans ideology these days.

Such a sad story all around, but I'm so happy to work with doctors and nurses who find trans ideology to be harmful and don't believe you can change your sex."

Unfortunately, very few people immediately jump to the conclusion of '' trans '' when something is a bit off. That's how you have people like this person raping lesbian women by larping as a woman.
Sadly, I know an AGP who started in his late 20s and the first few times I saw him I had no idea until a friend told me that he was a trans woman. I thought he was an odd looking woman. So yes, sadly lesbian women fall victim more often to these people these days. They should be legally required to disclose their birth gender before engaging in sexual activity.

As they get their surgeries covered and as these surgeries are refined day after day, it allows them to larp more successfully as the opposite sex. Sadly they start younger these days too. Those who start in their mid 40s have no chance of ever passing for a woman, agreed. But those who start in their teens, twenties or early 30s Sadly have a chance to make the costume realistic enough to trick people.

5596,kabloona,Yes and what about the little penis head instead of a clit?
5597,quasarbar,I'll take your word for it.
5598,quasarbar,Sorry to hear about that.  Really glad you lived through it though!
5599,quasarbar,"I'm a woman and my sense of smell isn't stellar.  Plus someone might have a cold or allergies.

And even men don't deserve to be violated by licking a ""pussy"" they think is a woman's but isn't."
5600,THE_VIRGIN_SURGEON,"'Pussy pass' this person may in fact be an incel, in the original meaning of the word."
5601,mystikelftwigg,Still sorry that happened to you. Nobody deserves that at all. It’s rapey. Whether you are a male or female.
5602,,"It is manipulative and disgusting. I've never seen a woman do this, only men and I'm learning of women doing this only now."
5603,,Then I stand corrected. I do think men are more likely to pull this though.
5604,,"It was really sad because he was 100% led on and caught feelings. The TIM even thought they could have a family together and he let him believe that it was possible. Unfortunate that it was all a lie. Had they been truthful perhaps the guy would have still fallen for the TIM, and in that case could have been a better relationship - more authentic."
5605,,Unfortunately a lot of women are ignorant about their bodies. I agree though
5606,,"Sigmoid colon, yep."
5607,throwawayc2VjcmV0,"That's apparently a more rare method these days. The one person I know about has had the penile inversion as some variation of this seems to be the go-to in most, if not all of Europe."
5608,,And this dude is trying to say that some girl licked his ass juice out of his fake pussy and didn't know anything was up? Hahaha
5609,Ergative_Absolutive,Neovaginas constructed with tissue taken from the sigmoid colon apparently retain a fecal odor indefinitely. This is one of the reasons that this procedure is generally not favored.
5610,throwaway275445,"The smell of shit comes from the bacteria in it. 

Neovaginas have the same bacteria as the inside of the bowel whether they used bowel material in the construction or not. 

Vaginas have a very delicately balanced microbiome which as of yet can not be replicated."
5611,realestniggainreddit,You don’t deepthroat the clit?
5612,armalite_isforlovers,"We used to have a subreddit for things like this. 

We *used* to."
5613,armalite_isforlovers,">even men

Nobody deserves to tricked into a non consenting homosexual act. Either way the above post is pure  fantasy as we all know what the nightmare reality of the neovagina really looks like."
5614,Hobolyra,"Sadly I have a female ""friend"" that does this shit as well."
5615,,[deleted]
5616,SuspiciousVelcro,Sadly..
5617,THE_VIRGIN_SURGEON,"So here's how I view this. Both sexes have their fair share of narcissists, yes. However, only 1 sex is innately stronger on average due to biology. This allows them do be physically demanding as well."
5618,Orange_Man-Bad,"I think it just all depends. I'm into girls so I see it in them, you're into guys so you see it there. Really it's just horrible people trying to take advantage of others. Which is why I stopped the whole ""Dating Game"". People in general; man and woman just want to take advantage.

 I'd just as soon sit down and do my own thing now and if I meet a nice sensible girl along the way all the better.  If not, oh well. Not everybody finds somebody."
5619,,"Come on! Lets be fair! It's ""sigmoid colon juice""!!!!!"
5620,loleelo,Ok this one gave me a chuckle.

5622,FancyRedditAccount,"I'm already looking up at r/datahoarders for how to archive THIS subreddit, because either this or r/menwinningwomenssport is next."
5623,kmalevich,"Wow, I didn't realize it got banned. Fuck. Meanwhile porn subreddits that cater to guys who get off on subjugating, controlling, and torturing women are thriving as ever."
5624,ikeaEmotional,Was neo vag diseaters banned?
5625,,Or a non consenting heterosexual one
5626,PillowGatorade,"Lol, caught that too. Classy."
5627,,"But never to you though, right?"
5628,,"I do think that narcissism exists in both sexes. But demanding sex or feeling entitled to sex I view as something more men do than women. 

Do you think it's because men are more receptive so sexual advances (do you believe this) and thus when a woman wants sex they put out so it's not really a question of the man thinking ""oh hey she demands sex or debates me for sex"" but ""she's into me"". Meanwhile maybe the reverse wouldn't be true in that a woman would think ""he's into me"". So it's viewed differently?

I mean, I don't think that is the case.

I still think that men are more sexually driven, as such are more likely to want sex and use all tactics they can in order to get it."
5629,,"Sometimes people find their partner later in life too and that is okay. There is no script for how a life is supposed to go, you just got to ride the waves and take it as they come."
5630,armalite_isforlovers,"You're doing good work. Also, honestly....mods of this sub might even want to private for a while, figure out a plan....new sub, also private....slowly start approving users. Just saying, it's hard to do once you get the hammer and you don't have the ability to speak to your group all at once. Hopefully that's already being worked on."

5632,armalite_isforlovers,"It was really recently. The same people who worked so hard to get that sub banned are gunning for this one gender critical next. Didn't realize you participated in a ""hate subreddit"" huh?"
5633,armalite_isforlovers,Yes.
5634,armalite_isforlovers,"Absolutely. I wasn't trying to imply that either is ok, that was just the situation I was replying about."
5635,,[deleted]
5636,THE_VIRGIN_SURGEON,"I see what you mean and I agree, sorry if my comment made it seem otherwise. On average men are more sexually driven, and like you said, will be more likely to be demanding. I was just pointing out that there was a physical component as well (not necessarily rape, but less scared of the consequences of being demanding; I guess that encroaches on the territory of rape though)."
5637,Orange_Man-Bad,Amen to that.
5638,FancyRedditAccount,"If they go private, I'd really appreciate an invite."
5639,degustibus,"United we stand, divided we fall.  Either you're for free speech or censorship.  One woman's place to discuss ideas is another man's hate speech that must be banned.  Let's take Reddit back to its roots.  A place for people to communicate.  For a long time the standard was straightforward, actual speech was protected unless it involved something abhorrent and illegal, e.g. child pornography.  Now on Reddit it's a strange political game of overpowering moderators and campaigns to rid the place of any dissent."
5640,ikeaEmotional,Lame.
5641,quasarbar,"Kind of like how I wasn't trying to imply that men are less worthy of having sexual boundaries, but said ""even men"" since the previous individual specified men and that was the situation I was replying about. ;)"
5642,,"If you read my replies to other people in this thread you'll see that I elaborated when I said that males are more sexually motivated. Do you agree or disagree? Yes women can be too, but on average men take the cake. Also, yes me personally I have never heard of a woman debating a man to have sex with them. That's just me.

Has this happened to you? Probably not... Yet you insist..."
5643,armalite_isforlovers,Same. Once you're on the AHS radar it can become a bit of a shell game.
5644,damixtoogreen,yo same
5645,armalite_isforlovers,"Super lame. The HTIC don't like their business out  there, goes against the narrative. Harder to recruit eggs and insecure teens."
5646,armalite_isforlovers,That's totally fair and I'll take you at your word that's what you meant. I didn't connect the two.
5647,,"I was so deep in the comments on another thread I must've missed that you quoted ""even men"", I agree with you"
