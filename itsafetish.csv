I hate misogynists so much. I hate how far they'll go to disparage women and justify their subordination. And I hate how people who claim to want to be women are eagerly reinforcing those same stereotypes used to undermine and hurt actual women.

 I mean the way I interprate the meme is like they're much more likely to be getting off to the idea they are doing the dumb girl anime trait which tends to be ""cute"" so it makes them feel cute. So if anything alot of stuff they say can be traced back to anime stereotypes lol, the amount of woman in here right now seething to the bone are clearly thinking too deep about this holy damn."

They turn themselves into objects of what they think the female experience is, just to get themselves extra horny.

In a recent hontrapoints video he said (and I'm paraphrasing through a quote I heard elsewhere because I don't make a habit of watching psuedointellectuals in fetish gear) if you can't handle being a man you should throw in the towel and become a woman. This quote really highlights the mindset that he and a lot of transcels have, that becoming a woman is giving up. He let the mask slip there for a moment and let it be known that he views being a man as taking an active role and being a woman is a passive role after they ""give up"". These people have a really warped world view, it's a shame that they have such a bully pulpit in academia where they can preach this nonsense."
68,Nebel01,"My mother was a soldier( i wrote about her being a sharpshooter.)but she had to leave the army when she got pregnant, had to take the entire blame and forced to stay mute about the whole deal so to not damage the dude and the army reputation.She often mention how she miss her days in the army, also im 99% sure it was rape to boot.

Ended up trying to find an explanation to all this mess so she turned to religion. While studying theology  she ended up in a relationship with an abusive drughead( LUL this is redundant dont you think?).Not only didnt she find answer to her questions but new one started to sprout out.Left the asshole and ended up in a small village working as a barmaid (where she found my dad, an adorable dork of a gentle giant of a lumberjack ( i love my dad, he is what men should strive to be, honest, hardworker, full of love for other and gentle with everyone, especially kids and animals)). when she finally finished her theology master degree she started to work as a pastoral  agent, teaching religions to kids. Lost her post because priests are dickwad narcissist male with power trips

72,69-XXX,"Theyre not wrong about this though.  Theyre actually pointing out a legitimate problem.  The notion of Progress has been so glorified, without any hard set definitions, that once something gets labelled as a Progressive cause, theres really no going back amongst that political faction.  They are not going to back down on this Trans thing, ever.  The majority of people who consider themselves Progressive are going to continue to support it, and most of those people will never have to deal with the ramifications.  For those of us who do support ""progressive"" things like basic human rights, but not this, we have lost.  I'm sorry to say, the game is over.  The Trans agenda has inserted itself so fully into the center of ""progressive"" politics that it is inextricable and unquestionable.  There is no more ""fixing this from within"", only a splintering of factions.  The fact that rightwing people also worry about this trans thing is a sign of that.  Youre both looking at the sames garbage fire, appalled for different reasons, but the fire still burns.  The best course is to just disengage from society until this whole thing collapses in in itself, and to try to rebuild something sane of the Left from the ashes, but for now trying to speak out in anything but GC or RW spaces is going to be futile and socially suicidal.  We are in this for the long haul.  Im not saying to team up with politics you hate, Im saying Im stepping back and watching society burn from a distance."

Apparently you are pretty bad at assuming others mentality. Maybe you should, ya know, not do that. Try getting to know a Transgender person. Get a first hand view of THEIR perspective instead of spouting hate and assuming you know what they feel."
79,gendercritfem,"""progressive"" causes lose ground all the time, even ones that are actually progressive.

In the past several decades, we've lost ground in union rights, abortion rights, voting rights for ethnic minorities, and immigration rights. The president is Donald J. Trump. ""Progressivism"" isn't some magic word that guarantees success.

And I think the rot can be excised, there's even historical precedent! This isn't the first time that a movement for oppression has latched onto a progressive cause. In the first wave of feminism, there were lots of anti-immigrant bigots who managed to shoehorn their agenda into the legitimate suffrage movement. In the 2000s, neocons tried to claim that the bloody invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan were ""feminist"" projects designed to liberate women. Both of these were accepted as ""progressive"" in their time, but are not viewed as such today. The trans movement is similar to these in that it claims to be an extension of a genuine progressive cause (LGB rights), while only using it as an excuse to oppress and endanger women. I have faith that people will eventually recognize the mistake that was made here, as they have in the past."

84,69-XXX,"Oh im certainly not meaning to say that progressive movements dont lose ground.  In fact I believe that TRAs being given the reins of Progressive movements is going to fuck us all.  What I meant was that now given that this has become THE cause de jour of those with the power to dictate what ""Progress"" means, there is no going back.  They are in charge of the ""progressive movement"" now and I dont think they will ever allow trans shit to be taken off the table.  It would take a political coup of sorts, and would require new organizations - the trans will not be excised from the posts they were awarded.  Theyre willing to use Human Rights Courts to get their balls fondled, imagine what theyll do when threatened with political displacement.  We put a monkey in the drivers seat and we cant get it out now.  But forming ""new movements"" means a splintering of effort and loss of effectiveness.  I dont think there is a good answer to this problem.  I think the things that could be done to fix this would be unpalatable to everyone involved, and will never happen.  I don't think we'll ever see an alliance of ""right and left"" on this, which is what it would take to have the required political weight.  So we fracture.  Factions will form, each weaker than the previous.  I dont think this gets fixed short of dramatic change in planetary/societal conditions, ie a collapse of industrial civilization.  Until then, catgirls have the monopoly on ""our"" voices, be that women or progressives or minorities or pro-healthcare folks.  It doesn't look good.  They are not going to relinquish power, and lets be real, they will never be asked to."

144,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"> I honestly don't understand this fake period BS that TiMs spout off about. 

Have you ever seen the TV show ""Dexter?""

Honestly, it's a fairly accurate representation of how psychopaths think. As Dexter goes about his life, he's always asking himself *""how would a normal person react in this situation?""* and Dexter is constantly attempting to mimic human emotion, when the truth is that he's just a blank automaton. Being a psychopath is very much like being a robot. Mark Zuckerberg is an obvious example, he's just a complete robot. *""The Social Network""* did a wonderful job of capturing that.

Now, understanding all of that, *what if you were a psychopath who was attempting to pass as a woman?* You would do all the things that you've seen women do. And that's what a lot of these TiMs are mimicking; they're acting out the things that they've seen their sisters do, or their mothers do. It's the reason they have this weird disconnect from human morality. No sane woman would throw a pool party with topless twelve year olds, but a male psychopath would."

159,merewautt,"A lot of doctors will actually argue that it's *healthier* long term to skip periods with birth control. Every period the lining is shed and regrown and *any* biology mechanism that involves injury or growing new tissue ups the life long risk for cancer. Because every new cell formed in the body has the possibly of malfunctioning, going rogue and multiplying rapidly. Which is the definition of a cancerous cell.

Women in the past were pregnant much more often during their lifetime, and many doctors think the modern woman may be at higher risk for ovarian cancer due to hundreds of more periods during their reproductive years. So many of them *recommend* skipping periods if your birth control allows it.

Hormonal birth control has it own issues for a lot of women, but if you're already using it successfully without terrible side effects, don't listen to the scare tactics telling you to take the sugar week and get your period if you don't get any peace of mind out of it. *A lot* of researchers think it lowers your lifetime risk for ovarian cancer."
160,GCchick,"I'm the same. I enjoy my periods even when they're painful because it connects me to my body and... without wanting to sounds to newagey, it connects me to nature. I also feel closer to women, past present and future. There's something really beautiful about periods. I could never relate to the women that said they hated them, or wish they didn't have any. I know that my best friend also feels the same as me, so we're not alone!"

179,noisyasamouse,"Especially since the ""period"" you get on the placebo week isn't even a real menstrual period, and wasn't included for medical reasons. It wasn't just a side effect that they didn't' bother to fix either, it was a deliberate addition. A deliberate addition of medically unnecessary pain and bleeding. It was either included as an attempt to avoid freaking out Catholics (who would not appreciate the lifting of ""Eve's curse""), or because the people who invented it thought that women wouldn't be able to wrap their tiny little lady brains around the idea of something that temporarily makes you infertile also temporarily stopping your period, depending on what source you believe."

> This portion of my decision addresses Ms. Yaniv’s complaints against Blue Heaven Beauty Lounge and Ms. Benipal, Ms. DaSilva, Ms. Tran, Ms. Dulay, and Merle Norman. In each of these cases, the Respondents advertised the service of “brazilian waxing”, and it was this service which Ms. Yaniv attempted to book. These cases raise two common issues at the outset: (1) what service was Ms. Yaniv requesting, and (2) does this service constitute a brazilian wax, such that it is one the Respondents were customarily providing to the public.  In this section, I address each of these issues in turn, and then go on to apply my findings to each individual complaint.    
>  
>9 A.The service Ms. Yaniv was requesting Ms. Yaniv does not dispute that she was requesting that these Respondents wax her genitals. In this unique context, her genitals were therefore relevant to her complaints – specifically to the question of whether the Respondents customarily provided the type of genital waxing that she was requesting. Throughout the hearing, however, Ms. Yaniv refused to answer questions about her genitals and argued that such questions were inappropriate. Given her representation to various Respondents that she had “male parts”, has not “gone through surgery”, and “was born a man now I’m a woman”, the hearings initially proceeded on the understanding that she has a penis and scrotum, and that she was therefore requesting waxing of the scrotum. However, under cross examination she was evasive on the issue, referring to “whatever is down there”. In the Blue Heaven hearing on July 4, she insinuated that she may be intersex but refused to say whether she was. Asked to explain what she meant when she told Ms. Benipal she had “male parts”, she testified simply “I mean male parts”.  On July 17, in the hearing against Ms. DaSilva, Ms. Yaniv testified that she had “male genitals”. Moments later, she testified, for the first time, that she is intersex. She said again that she had “male parts” and then added that she had “other stuff”, though she initially refused to say whether that included a vulva. She denied, for the first time, that she had asked Ms. DaSilva to wax a scrotum. Ms. Yaniv refused to answer questions put to her by Ms. DaSilva’s counsel, and so I intervened:   
>  
>Tribunal:   Ms. Yaniv, it’s relevant to this complaint. ... The question is, what were you asking Ms. DaSilva to wax?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  I was asking for a female genital waxing wax .... A brazilian wax.   
>  
>Tribunal:  ... Forget brazilian, brozilian, male, female, whatever – what body part were you asking her to ask?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  The genitals, the genital region.   
>  
>Tribunal:  Their defence hinges on a defence that they, that she, is not comfortable waxing a scrotum. So are you talking about a scrotum, or are you talking about a vulva, or are you talking about both?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  The second one.   
>  
>Tribunal:  Vulva?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  Yes.   
>  
>Tribunal:  ... You’re saying you were asking her to wax a vulva? Ms. Yaniv:   
>  
> Yes. ... I’m not gonna say whether I have the whole thing. I’ll say it exists.  
>  
> At this point, Mr. Cameron asked Ms. Yaniv to submit to an independent medical examination to verify her genitals. I refused to make such an order, on the basis that it was unduly intrusive and disproportionate to the issues at stake.  I am satisfied, based on Ms. Yaniv’s representations to the Respondents that she has “male parts”, “used to be a boy”, and has not “gone through surgery yet”, as well as her evidence in these hearings that she has “male parts”, that Ms. Yaniv was seeking to have hair removed from a scrotum. Whether or not she may also have a vulva is not ultimately determinative of any issue in this complaint and so I do not need to engage further with that question"

> However, I find that Ms. Yaniv’s predominant motive in filing her waxing complaints is not to prevent or remedy alleged discrimination, but to target small businesses for personal financial gain. In many of these complaints, she is also **motivated to punish racialized and immigrant women based on her perception that certain ethnic groups, namely South Asian and Asian communities, are “taking over”** and advancing an agenda hostile to the interests of LGBTQ+ people. These motives are not consistent with the Code’s purposes, and in particular its purpose of promoting a climate of understanding and mutual respect, where all are equal in dignity and rights: s.

Rather, I find that the only reason that Ms. DaSilva cancelled the appointment was because she found Ms. Yaniv’s behaviour troubling and deceptive – which it was. ""

What if he was targeting white women who don’t belong to religious organizations? What if he was offering to donate any money awarded him to charity? Would the court still have ruled this way?

It's the same ""why won't women have sex with meeeee?  Why aren't they hopping on my dick?  They're so shallow!"" reasoning by males like Joseph8276 and Chris-chan, but women are supposed to pretend that it's somehow different this time because it's a *Woke* incel rant instead of a *regular* incel rant, so instead of the speaker just ranting at women for not having sex with him, we get a speaker ranting at women for not having sex with him *and* comparing it to actual oppression.  I'm sure an activist like Rosa Parks would *love* to hear how someone not having sex with you is the same thing as Jim Crow laws.

I think even in the trans community that’s been discussed to the point of death. 

Misogyny and the objectification of women lends to TIFs passing, too. People see short hair/pants and assume man; if you’re not performing femininity you must be a dude. When I cut my hair into a pixie last year, I definitely felt that shift."

Studies reporting similar results to this poll:

**MtF transgender persons' self-reported lifetime incidence of autogynephilic arousal**

|Study|Non-homo/AGP|Non-homo/Non-AGP|% Non-homo/AGP|Homo/AGP|Homo/Non-AGP|% Homo/AGP|
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Blanchard (1985)|46|17|73%|15|85|15%|

|Lawrence (2005)|181|21|90%|3|9|25%|
|Smith et al. (2005)|40|27|60%|5|29|15%|
|Nuttbrock et al. (2011)|131|48|73%|90|301|23%|
|Totals|458|126|78.4%|118|471|20.0%|

* 78.4% of 584 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual acknowledged at least one lifetime incidence of autogynephilic arousal, compared to just 20% MtF subjects classified as homosexual.

* In four of the five studies (Lawrence excluded) reporting MtF subjects' history of transvestic fetishism, 73% of 382 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual reported at least one lifetime episode of transvestic fetishism, compared to just 20% MtF subjects classified as homosexual.

* In Lawrence's (2005) study of of 232 MtF transsexuals patients who underwent SRS, 90% of 202 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual reported at least one lifetime episode of autogynephilic arousal, with median and modal frequencies of hundreds of episodes or more. Of the 12 MtF subjects classified as homosexual, only 3 (25%) reported at least on episode one lifetime episode of autogynephilic arousal, and ""the median and modal number of episodes homosexual participants reported were both never.""

* In Nuttbrock's et al. (2011) study, 40% of the exclusively homosexual MtF group began HRT during adolescence, compared to just 1% of the heterosexual MtF group and 14% of the bisexual MtF group. Thus validating Blanchard's observation that homosexual MtF transsexuals present for clinical assessment at a significantly younger age than non-homosexual MtF transsexuals. Furthermore, 82% of exclusively gynephilic MtF subjects reported a history of transvestic fetishism, compared to just 14% of MtF subjects who had started HRT during adolescence."

475,Mentalink,"That's not exactly what it is; it's not about people changing sex, it's about people becoming aware of/accepting that they are transgender, as in, that their gender identity does not correspond to their assigned gender at birth. It's just a cute way of saying it. Coming out of the egg, it's a bit like coming out of the closet except it's for gender identity and not sexuality.

Views on women aren't a marker for who's female. By that logic, right-wing/anti-feminist non-trans women aren't women.

>The only difference is that they are not sexually attracted to women.

...And not fetishistic in their feelings toward men. And not fetishistic toward women. Which means that if transsexuality is not biologically real, ""homosexual TiMs"" would have entirely different reasons for transitioning.

Changing your gender expression wouldn't require surgery or HRT. If you are doing that you are trying to change your *sex* [even though humans can't actually do that, most transpeople falsely believe that they can change sex.].

Birds are hatched, implying the opposite sex is equivalent to unintelligent animals is very disrespectful, do you really need that explained to you in such detail?

We love to insult ourselves.

Seriously, are you really that daft? Jesus Christ. And you people say we're the ones getting offended for no reason. 

And about your first point, it's missing mine entirely, and not worth responding to; you went on this rant about how changing sex and gender aren't the same thing even though I never implied that they were. All I said is that the ""egg"" analogy applies to gender identity and not to sex change.

Also, you know it's not only birds who lay eggs right? Not that it matters cause either way it's just an analogy but the mental gymnastics you did to be offended by it impress me."
492,livipup,"That analogy with birds is a bit of a stretch. And, well, sex is complicated. There are things scientifically recognized as primary sexual characteristics which can naturally change throughout a person's lifetime or are even expected to. It's also possible to be born with these primary sexual characteristics mismatched. There's even research suggesting that trans people are neurologically intersex. I think the egg idea is a bit weird, but I don't believe that it reflects anyone's views of non-trans people at all."

Yes. IME HSTS get even more visibility.  Within trans activism, they collaborate, too: Laverne Cox raised money for an imprisoned child killer rapist. Calpernia Addams and Lynn Conway. Among many examples. outside of trans activism,[they still flip out over pronouns, want children transed, claim they're the only ""true women"", can be awful to women and gay men.](https://i.imgur.com/U25SAN1.png) (that includes those who associate themselves with GC feminists)."

499,livipup,"I can't imagine there are too many people on Reddit who are qualified to decide if a peer-reviewed study is valid or not and who also care what a small percentage of the population does with their bodies, so I think we just have to trust scientists when so many of them start saying the same thing. Unless maybe there are just as many or more saying something different. The APA and WHO both seem to have accepted that it's at least not a part of someone's sexuality and they're generally pretty trustworthy. I don't agree with everything they claim, but I do assume they know better than I do."

501,TrueJacksonVP,"These women are likely bi or pan if they are attracted to pre-op penis in any way, shape, or form. 

This is the problem we as lesbians are currently facing. Lesbians cannot find a penis attractive, that’s *why* we’re lesbians. Otherwise we’d likely be open to dating men or pre-op transwomen. We’d also be *bisexual* for it. 

The girls claiming “I’m a lesbian and *I* like girl dick, so all you other lesbians are being close minded and transphobic” are a huge part of the problem right now. I as a lesbian *cannot* force myself to like penises and their functions. They psychically turn me off. I don’t even enjoy penetration. Yet I’ve been told that I’m transphobic and close minded for not being open to girl penis. If a straight male said this to me, it’d be considered homophobic. No one would *ever* demand a gay man accept their vagina. Genitalia is an important part of sexuality and for some is *the* most important part. Transbians have no right to demand penis acceptance from an established group of women who hate penis. Most of the transbians I’ve encountered have no desire for bottom surgery and still like their penis. But they rarely fuck each other — which really tells you all you need to know. 

Right now a lot of bisexuals and straight women are appropriating lesbian culture and identity because it’s somehow “cooler” or “easier” to just cut and dry state they’re a lesbian than explain the intricacies of their own sexuality. I understand why they might, but this in turn damages “actual” lesbians who are not afforded the same leniencies in terms of our rigid sexualities. If you’re a lesbian who likes penis, you’re not a lesbian haha. And people get really angry when you gatekeep their identity (even though they do not fit the “requirements” for the identity they’ve chosen). They then damage the perception of lesbians because of attitudes like “well she *was* a lesbian and now she’s dating Rob, so I guess they all secretly want the D”. We don’t. 


Sorry for the novel and that’s not at all directly at you, it’s just extremely frustrating to be a cis lesbian in this day and age. It was easier a decade ago — which is mind blowing. As gay men and trans folk progress, lesbian identity had become watered down and appropriated by men with fetishes, entitled/upset transwomen, and bisexuals who don’t realize the damage they’re doing by claiming to be a lesbian while harboring attraction towards dick."
502,corny_reptile,">Save

You are moving the goal posts. The claim was that primary sex characteristics naturally change and trans people are ""neurologically intersex."" I don't think the WHO and APA are saying anything of the sort. Sure a penis or a vulva will change with puberty but they don't naturally change from one to the other! That's absurd."

We are going to hear about this dude in the news. Some headline like ""Local Pervert found with freezer full off dismembered female body parts"" 

The sexualized jealousy of this freak is scary."
593,WitchMeansWoman,If you really thought it was normal you would have just asked your sister for her underwear rather than steal it. You know you are violating her. That’s why you like it. That’s why no one feels bad for you.

This shit is not normal, not valid, not acceptable, and certainly not something a woman would do or explain. Pathetic little boy."
597,SureSureFightFight,"NORMAL DOES NOT MEAN GOOD.

I'm so fucking sick of ""Everyone does it, so it's normal and healthy!""

Nobody says murder is healthy, and yet it's a 'normal' part of human society. Nobody says theft is healthy, and yet it's perfectly normal to want to take things that don't belong to you (as in, everyone's thought it, not ""everyone is a kleptomaniac""). 

For most of human history, rape was normal and yet everyone agrees that rape is fucking horrible.


And you know what? The guy isn't even right. Out of seven billion people you can find a lot of people with incestuous feelings, but statistically it is **rare**. It is **not normal**. Anyone who has taken a college sociology class can tell you that there are so many psychological safeguards in place to prevent that.


And hey, I know you're probably reading this and have all sorts of prepared arguments to regurgitate, so let me just tell you:

**I don't care.** Your bullshit is so obvious a mile off, and anyone not tainted by your delusion can see it.


And lastly,

>Akin to bullying, but I'm used to it

It's not bullying, it's holding you up as an example to make sure nobody else becomes a creepy pervert. Just like all the other 'bullies' have been doing with you.

Everyone goes through stuff. Most people don't jack off in another person's underwear. If you are so afraid of 'feeling ashamed', maybe there is a good reason for that."

When I was young, I couldn't get a girlfriend to save my life. And then I tried a bunch of stuff and figured out what works.

But on the manosphere subreddits, they're constantly giving out shitty advice. In particular, they're OBSESSED with lifting weights. 

Protip: If you're 20 years old, and you want a girlfriend, the easiest way to get one is *to ask a girl out.* You can lift weights until you're blue in the face, but if you don't actually ask a girl out, you're wasting your time.

She NEVER asked him what his penis is until when she was about 4 ish and saw her little cousin naked and saw he had one too, obviously, being a sane person we simply told her that boys have a penis.  As she got older we got her a book about bodies that explains anatomy and sex and periods in child friendly terms (she hides it under her bed but approaches me occasionally to ask for clarification).

This man should tell his child the truth. He’s a male and so he has a penis. If his dysphoria isn’t bad enough that he’s able to keep and use his penis to impregnate his wife surely he can tell his child what a penis is and what it’s used for?

876,Comfycodone,"Theres a lot of problems with even attempting to bring something like this to a panel. One such problem is the fact that you dont have to be trans to be mentally unstable and have kids. Plenty of GC people are too mentally unstable to raise children, but they have children anyway. Should we take away the children from these people as well? If so, then it's not really a debate on trans people, but mentally unstable people in general. But then that leads to the problem of ""assuming"" that trans people are mentally unstable, which is not a hot topic for discussion in the PC world we live in. Because of this, people just wont hear it. They'll turn their ears off to it or scream and yell until the topic is removed from discussion. 

But even if we were able to get this discussion into the public forum, they would want proof that a child raised in a trans household is at risk of becoming mentally ill. This leads to even more problems, because even if that child ends up becoming trans, the trans community will just say ""THEY WERE BORN THAT WAY ITS NOT THE PARENTS FAULT"" or if they do become mentally ill then it's because ""SOCIETY BULLIED THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR TRANS PARENTS"". They will find a way to draw the narrative to represent their own agenda, and the faceless masses will agree with them so they dont appear to be oppressive shitlords. 

Honestly, it's just not worth the fuss. It's for the best that we quietly seethe to ourselves and circlejerk our distaste for the mental illness known as transgenderism amongst ourselves."

Nonbinary being used as its own gender separate from male and female is entirely a tumblr thing too. Its origin is mostly used by tumblrinas who think that not liking pink and femininity makes them the ultimate #notlikeothergirls, which they call nonbinary.

My theory is that men are like dogs. Will literally fuck anything. Women act as 'calmers' in straight relationships. They temper the more wild and crazy aspects of male sexuality.

Men are dogs. Gay men are dogs with no leash. And  I include trans people in this. Trans 'women' mostly seem to go with other trans 'women' which basically means its two gay men. So the 'extreme' aspect comes into play again. There is a distinct lack of feminine energies involved. Couple this with how porn tends towards making people go slowly more and more extreme in order to hit the same 'high'. And well. It can be a recipe for disaster."

Mace dehabilitates a person. You can’t even tie your shoes if you get maced, yet alone focus your attention to your victim to kill them.

for this reason, I would guess that most content on r/menwritingwomen is submitted by women.

Or, to show any lurking TiMs there might be another explanation for their 'dysphoria', AGP/porn addiction, while all the gender clinics and TRAs shove them on the express train towards transitioning so maybe they reevaluate before doing something irreversible.

They just get banned periodically and then a new one pops up to repeat the cycle

I think we have to admit that the project of this sub fundamentally goes against Reddit's core beliefs, and they will be looking for any reason to ban us. While I agree we shouldn't hand them that reason, we shouldn't be too zealous in our moderation either, as people here express frustration or disgust they are not able to express irl.

Trans ideology labels our belief that they are not women as violence in itself anyway, no matter how much we sugar coat it. When Reddit admins inevitably accept that premise, we'll be banned, so why take extra measures to prevent it?"

That their entire sense of self rests on shaky ground gives others power to unravel their psyche just by questioning.

1410,Krombopulos-Snake,"But this is exactly what happens on Reddit. The idea of letting people have their own things , even if you don't agree with them is no longer allowed anymore.

Put it like this. 
loli and shota, drawings get banned for being harmful to minors meanwhile, several of the transboards that specifically target real children and lure them into their creepy discords are still up. You know, I feel I shouldn't have to make the distinction between real and imaginary children but the way Reddit has been lately makes me do so.

Side note: I absolutely hate discord.  I just want to talk about/ play video games, not listen to mostly false, sometimes true stories of debauchery. Anyway.

A board about irrationally hating women is shut down, but any of the multiple boards about irrationally hating men are allowed to thrive - - *until they start hating transwomen!* THEN , it's time to shut them down. 

Name and shame is not allowed, until it's allowed.

Witchhunting is a global rule, it's just not allowed on this site---- until there are several boards completely dedicated to witch hunting and stalking. My favorite one, the one that's been stalking me for a year now finally got quarantined. Only after they targeted a fucking child - now they've been reduced to Frenworld nonsense trying to avoid being banned all together. 
This is noteworthy because for far too long this sub was above all the rules of Reddit. 

Being a pretend Communist is perfectly fine on Reddit, being a pretend Nazi is not. 
Even though both groups rounded up and killed people who disagreed, but don't say that on the commie subs. They'll have you hanged for that.

A board saying mean things about a billionaire liberal is considered a conspiracy board and shut down meanwhile, a board saying mean things about a billionaire conservative is considered normal and is allowed to operate. Fun Fact:* Both these men are terrible people and the fact that users on Reddit actually believe either of them are ""good guys"" is actually frightening to me.*

A board about how to get opiates is shut down - -yet several boards about how to get weed, cocaine and even make your own ""party favors""*Disclaimer: We do not condone or endorse this stuff, Safety not guaranteed* --  are still up and running. 

**Let's not even get into the endless amount abuse that the user verification systems have fostered over the years due to mods being sick , abusive assholes on the porn subs.**

A board of white people being racist assholes in the name of  politics is allowed to stay up while a board of white people being racist assholes just because they can, gets shut down.

tl;dr people like to pretend reddit is fair and just. 

Ultimately it's just a large chan with shittier rules than a regular chan - but unlike chans, people cannot play nice on reddit and just keep to their own circlejerks. They have to branch out and shut down other people's circlejerks in order to make themselves feel better.

But you know what?  I do not care about these subs. What I do care about is that all of them have the right to exist.  I know people hate me over the color of my skin, getting rid of their board doesn't change anything. 

I know people hate me over my opinions, boo hoo. I should still be able to post them and if someone feels like it, they should be able to argue with me without getting interrupted or brigaded or stopped by a pissy mod who doesn't like my colorful choice of words.

You can't have a real discussion if you surround yourself with people who only agree with you and nothing is honest when you force people to agree with you or risk losing their right to even post."

Who cares what specifically caused the dysphoria to occur in your mind? Who cares whether it was caused by society treating them badly or if it was caused by them watching too much porn or whatever? Lots of people aren't treated nicely by society and lots of people watch porn. Neither of these things directly cause dysphoria, because the majority of people who watch porn or get treated poorly by society don't start thinking that they can just declare themselves the opposite gender. 

It is ultimately still a problem with the individual. Lots of random psychopaths and serial killers experienced abuse and ostracism by society too. Are we supposed to blame society being meanies as the cause of everything's fault? No, we blame these psychopaths and serial killers for **choosing** to be shitty humans. I blame trans people for having the audacity and delusion they can just **choose** to become whatever the fuck gender they want to be and expect society to go along with it ""because society are meanies who have oppressed me"".

Something tells me the same is going on with men at the rock bottom of masculinity. ""Be a man"" they're told, but they don't know how. ""Blegh"", they think.

I talked to a guy in long-term psychosis a few days ago and he was convinced that 1) 10-years-future-him could only change him 2) if someone wanted to help him it would only work if they did it 'right' 3) he couldn't articulate what would be the right kind of help and blamed the government (a continuation of the Nazis) for sending agents to cockblock him.

I blame trans people for having the audacity and delusion they can just choose to become whatever the fuck gender they want to be and expect society to go along with it ""because society are meanies who have oppressed me"".

Not everyone has the option to talk about it with someone in their life of course and I get that, but the calmer posts around here have the right it that that some people are approaching gender in a fetishistic way. Not all, I dont think- I disagree with this sub on some of that- but I do think it is good to open the discussion to their being not one solution for everyone struggling with their gender in some way, shape, or form. My goal is to provide some support to these people but not through stereotyping fantasies of how the other sex ""works"" or fetishism encroaching on other public norms (e.g. underwear worn publically, etc).

1635,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"I think that if you have a fetish, *nothing else does it for you.*

Here's an example:

A few years back, my wife and I decided to check out the ""swinger"" scene. Our expectation was that people in the scene would be having tons of sex. Much to our surprise, a lot of the men in the scene can't get it up anymore. We went to a couple parties, and it was full of women getting tied up in BDSM gear, but nobody was actually fucking. I watched some dude get blown for nearly an hour, and he couldn't get erect enough to penetrate his partner.

Another thing I noticed about the scene, was that we were literally the only people in a conventional relationship. Everyone else was poly or divorced.

I definitely wondered if their pursuit of a fetish led to the end of their relationships."

It's called puberty.

My detransition has been very successful so I'm one of the lucky ones and feel a moral obligation I guess to warn others.

I think a lot of what bothers me is sexual reassignment surgery feels a lot like mutilation to me. Were you offered therapy by anyone before they tried to persuade you to transition? Honestly I am all for people doing whatever they want with their lives as long as it doesn’t hurt other people but when I hear about children transitioning it makes me angry.

A few people did ask if I had perused therapy, but they were mostly drown out by the massive call of people telling me I'm actually trans.

I think the thing with the trans community is that they want to be supportive, but don't know how to approach the question of therapy. If you find a therapist who is not trans friendly then you're ""just hurting the person more by denying them of their true body"" or something like that, and that's oppressive, and we can't have that. 

But at the same time you need a therapist who will make you seriously consider your choices and make you question if you actually want to transition.

Its just so typical. They are MRA in drag. Its pretty damn male to just decide their ego matters more than what being a woman actually IS.

I don't know about gay men but trans people would definitely feel better if they just admitted they were gay. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

It makes total sense. Social media is basically a window to the minds of an entire nation's youth, and only in the most free countries (the west) did you really have that off the bat.

At least as far as mtfs go, I thought the concept was you were born with a female brain in a male body, or something close to that. However, I don't think people even care about that anymore. It seems to be more about incels pushing hormones onto other incels, a warped sense of how females operate, and fetishizing the idea of being a woman.

You can not compare that to Satanic panic nonsense, or even something like Columbine, which was a flash in the pan.

And, okay, I'll admit I wasn't alive in the 70's or coherent for most of the 80's, but were people ever being fired from their careers for listening to music that Christian fundamentalist groups didn't like?

How is this even a stereotype? Have they never seen female athletes? Like, surely women's sports would be slapstick comedy if this were true. Or does this only affect manic pixie dream girl wannabes? I didn't even realise this was a ""girly"" thing."
2264,,So this is new to me. Women are clumsy? I'm not.
2265,,Nah that’s the spiro making you foggy and tired and dizzy constantly lol.
2266,BoudiccaReturns,"Yellow: I think you’re hitting your head in doorways because you’re 6’4”, not because of the estrogen. 

Also, don’t we have, you know, much better dexterity than men? How many men can do the splits or a handstand? Did I just imagine McKayla Maroney killing it at the Olympics a few years back?"
2267,Frigez,"The only thing I can think of: It has to do with their loss of muscle mass. Body movement is affected and therefore it makes them clumsy. 

That person who mentioned ""blonde moments"" is obviously a fetischist."
2268,Mikhpv,So girl = child who hasn't developed yet proper coordination. Got it
2269,nuknaruk,Going to drill a hole in my brain to simulate the estrogen rot just you watch.
2270,icyspicykun,"Now i know why im so clumsy, damn estrogen."
2271,randomsomeone78,This makes me angry
2272,,"BUT IN A GIRLY KIND OF WAY

Fuck you. 

Also, as a woman with a high IQ, fuck you again. We’re not ditzes, we have actual personalities not centered around us being female."
2273,yaxxy,"Of corse you’re clumsy.. estrogen in a male body makes you weaker! Your body isn’t built to handle estrogen!

Girls on T feel weaker to!"
2274,zolowo,"Ooh! In my psychology college textbook it states that an extra X chromosome will make people clumsy and as chromosomes are tasked with the development of genitals and hormones it has the same effect, so in making fun of this and trying to claim a medical condition recognised by medical consensus that even has its place in the DSM-5 you are completely and utterly anti-science, do you guys also believe that the moon landing is fake and that vaccines cause autism? HELL FUCKIN YEAH YOU DO! WHO NEEDS SCIENCE"
2275,Mount-Cleverest,"What red pillers and trans have in common: ""All women are like that"""
2276,sunkenrocks,"If you're not a ditzy blonde, ~yOuRe NoT gOoD eNoUgH fOR tHiS cHiCk wItH a GiRlDiCk~

And don't you dare comment bigot I'm a lesbian"
2277,,"I’m a blonde, not dumb, an female."
2278,Shiny_Palace,"Did you ever see that post (I think it was on relationships or AITA) about the TIM who spent the night at her friends and started walking around naked, trying to have pillow fights (and absolutely whacking the shit out the girls) and generally acting like no one else there was any fun bc they refused to participate in “makeout parties like a typical girl sleepover”. It was so fucked up and the girl had to kick her out of the house when she woke up and the TIM was wandering around her kitchen totally nude."
2279,LivingandDyinginLA,I agree.
2280,T_SWIFT_RULEZ,They gave him woman of the year after he committed vehicular manslaughter. Transing is really a golden ticket to get away with literally anything.
2281,sunkenrocks,"TBF that was prehrt, no?"
2282,impersonated_essence,Perfect lmao
2283,girlmayor,"This, and not institutional sexism, is what has held us back for so long: once we are in a room, we must stay there indefinitely, lest we encounter doors. I am in the room I was born in."
2284,palerthanrice,">	Are they delusional?

I mean, literally yes."
2285,sunkenrocks,"Donna drops things in a girly way. What's delusional about a 60 year old man saying this?

Bigot!!!!"
2286,,"I feel the same way when they talk about their “PMS,” especially abdominal cramping.

Like, boy, I sure hope you’re lying, because the alternative would be that you’re having abnormal side effects from cross-sex hormones and should really tell your doctor (not just the Internet) about it."
2287,sunkenrocks,Oh he just forgot he was a man
2288,Bluemeanie76,Sane people would be concerned but these guys use signs of bad health as validation. 😑
2289,,Seriously. Or when they talk about how their hormones are giving them extreme mood swings. Uh maybe those hormones aren’t fucking good for you??????
2290,Ironlifeisweird,I don’t think it’s brain damage. Even people with higher amounts of hormones don’t experience brain damage. I just think they’re dillusioning themselves to a point similar to hysteria where they get these effects that don’t exist in actuality.
2291,limpinglamb,"I just misread your comment but to the tune of Bitch by Meredith Brooks. I'm a ditz, I'm a woman..."
2292,girlmayor,I also jump up and down with my knees together when I’m excited.
2293,ro0te,cue gender euphoria boner
2294,,"Some of the studies on brain sex have found men have better special abilities than women but again nature/nurture. If women were just inherently clumsy I doubt we’d have things like figure skating, dance, gymnastics, incredible female artists....not to mention many more dropped babies lol"
2295,Upper_Canada_Pango,"Men test on average better at ""spatial cognition"" but that's more to do with things like accurately striking a target with a thrown object... not walking into doorframes or dropping things. It is unknown to what degree this *statistical* difference is innate rather than acquired."
2296,throwaway275445,"On the contrary women are better at fine and precise motor skills while men are hamfisted. This is why in the past labour was split with women doing the fine, intricate, often decorative work which then lead to that decoration being associated with femininity."
2297,sunkenrocks,"They've got weaker bodies, so maybe they strain more. But that's carrying a medium sized animal, not a book."
2298,foxtrail87,"Oh I wouldn’t be surprised if it does. The offensive thing is that instead of thinking “ugh, these cross-sex hormones are messing with my functioning” they get all “teehee I’ve only been on estrogen for five minutes and I’m already a klutz such a blonde moment so girly teehee.” If you think being clumsy validates womanhood, then you’re just a plain ol’ sexist."
2299,sunkenrocks,Your natural hormones can have odd effects!
2300,chippysammy,"Ooh a little college student with a psychology text book thinks they’re smarter than a massive collective of scientists.     
  
Trans is anti science - they think they can change sex, thinks the wound between theirs legs are genitals etc. it reinforces gender stereotypes and is overrun with aggressive young white men - hmmm sounds inherently right wing!  
  
Try harder you sound like a child."
2301,w33dwick,Hey trans are just as 100% women as any biological women. Check your gender privilege bigot /s
2302,maskdmann,"Ah, the “concussion with a pillow” one?"
2303,shaggy1452,Link plz?! How can anyone lack that much self awareness??
2304,AcePilotson,What of the year?
2305,PixelGalaxyUwU,Or it could be because they're a literal celebrity who's able to pay off the cops
2306,donofsandiego,Underrated comment
2307,throwaway275445,Actually hrt causes brain tumors in men. It also increases heart disease which is associated with vascular dementia.
2308,XIVfourteen,*clumsy gay sounds*
2309,ringsofsaturnine,"The scores get a lot closer together when women play a bit of Tetris before the test. It's acquired: male infants encouraged to do more physical play, video games seen as a male pursuit, etc. Many shooting leagues have men and women competing together and women winning, and it's hypothesised that women even have an advantage due to our centre of gravity being lower down. I would really look hard at the studies on this."
2310,Nak_Tripper,That's so true. Women seem to be good at things like that I've noticed.
2311,zolowo,"Oh no I’m talking about medical consensus, this is medical consensus, you know what medical means right?"
2312,T_SWIFT_RULEZ,"That's what they gave him, not me."
2313,T_SWIFT_RULEZ,"Getting away with it is one thing, but being chosen as the woman of the year right after? Come on. There are billions of women who didn't commit manslaughter that year."
2314,Ironlifeisweird,"Really? Source on that? But Jesus Christ, if that’s true..."
2315,katakanbr,Man have better spatial ability due to The fact that they evolved as hunters and needed that ability
