I hate misogynists so much. I hate how far they'll go to disparage women and justify their subordination. And I hate how people who claim to want to be women are eagerly reinforcing those same stereotypes used to undermine and hurt actual women.

29,iRainbowsaur,"I don't think they're basing it on gender stereotypes (I don't think many millennials/current gen people post anime memes likely to actually belittle a womans smarts to a mans)

 I mean the way I interprate the meme is like they're much more likely to be getting off to the idea they are doing the dumb girl anime trait which tends to be ""cute"" so it makes them feel cute. So if anything alot of stuff they say can be traced back to anime stereotypes lol, the amount of woman in here right now seething to the bone are clearly thinking too deep about this holy damn."

They take the most offensive stereotypes of women and girls, and make it their entire persona, and then they go out to get ""validated"" so that they can experience ""gender euphoria"" and masturbate.  They turn themselves into objects of what they think the female experience is, just to get themselves extra horny.  

This is why I don't want TIMs in the women's bathroom.  I don't need a man much stronger than me who is getting off on being in the women's bathroom around me when I am half dressed.  It's horrifying."

In a recent hontrapoints video he said (and I'm paraphrasing through a quote I heard elsewhere because I don't make a habit of watching psuedointellectuals in fetish gear) if you can't handle being a man you should throw in the towel and become a woman. This quote really highlights the mindset that he and a lot of transcels have, that becoming a woman is giving up. He let the mask slip there for a moment and let it be known that he views being a man as taking an active role and being a woman is a passive role after they ""give up"". These people have a really warped world view, it's a shame that they have such a bully pulpit in academia where they can preach this nonsense."

Ended up trying to find an explanation to all this mess so she turned to religion. While studying theology  she ended up in a relationship with an abusive drughead( LUL this is redundant dont you think?).Not only didnt she find answer to her questions but new one started to sprout out.Left the asshole and ended up in a small village working as a barmaid (where she found my dad, an adorable dork of a gentle giant of a lumberjack ( i love my dad, he is what men should strive to be, honest, hardworker, full of love for other and gentle with everyone, especially kids and animals)). when she finally finished her theology master degree she started to work as a pastoral  agent, teaching religions to kids. Lost her post because priests are dickwad narcissist male with power trips

73,69-XXX,"Theyre not wrong about this though.  Theyre actually pointing out a legitimate problem.  The notion of Progress has been so glorified, without any hard set definitions, that once something gets labelled as a Progressive cause, theres really no going back amongst that political faction.  They are not going to back down on this Trans thing, ever.  The majority of people who consider themselves Progressive are going to continue to support it, and most of those people will never have to deal with the ramifications.  For those of us who do support ""progressive"" things like basic human rights, but not this, we have lost.  I'm sorry to say, the game is over.  The Trans agenda has inserted itself so fully into the center of ""progressive"" politics that it is inextricable and unquestionable.  There is no more ""fixing this from within"", only a splintering of factions.  The fact that rightwing people also worry about this trans thing is a sign of that.  Youre both looking at the sames garbage fire, appalled for different reasons, but the fire still burns.  The best course is to just disengage from society until this whole thing collapses in in itself, and to try to rebuild something sane of the Left from the ashes, but for now trying to speak out in anything but GC or RW spaces is going to be futile and socially suicidal.  We are in this for the long haul.  Im not saying to team up with politics you hate, Im saying Im stepping back and watching society burn from a distance."

78,killthenerds,Can you try to find the source for that paraphrase?
79,gendercritfem,"""progressive"" causes lose ground all the time, even ones that are actually progressive.

In the past several decades, we've lost ground in union rights, abortion rights, voting rights for ethnic minorities, and immigration rights. The president is Donald J. Trump. ""Progressivism"" isn't some magic word that guarantees success.

And I think the rot can be excised, there's even historical precedent! This isn't the first time that a movement for oppression has latched onto a progressive cause. In the first wave of feminism, there were lots of anti-immigrant bigots who managed to shoehorn their agenda into the legitimate suffrage movement. In the 2000s, neocons tried to claim that the bloody invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan were ""feminist"" projects designed to liberate women. Both of these were accepted as ""progressive"" in their time, but are not viewed as such today. The trans movement is similar to these in that it claims to be an extension of a genuine progressive cause (LGB rights), while only using it as an excuse to oppress and endanger women. I have faith that people will eventually recognize the mistake that was made here, as they have in the past."
80,gendercritfem,"I mean, you made [this lovely post](https://www.reddit.com/r/smuggies/comments/d50jjq/play_stupid_games_win_stupid_prizes/f0jsp6r/) calling women who date black men ""coal burners"", you post on /r/hateblackpeople, you're a genuinely racist piece of garbage.

84,69-XXX,"Oh im certainly not meaning to say that progressive movements dont lose ground.  In fact I believe that TRAs being given the reins of Progressive movements is going to fuck us all.  What I meant was that now given that this has become THE cause de jour of those with the power to dictate what ""Progress"" means, there is no going back.  They are in charge of the ""progressive movement"" now and I dont think they will ever allow trans shit to be taken off the table.  It would take a political coup of sorts, and would require new organizations - the trans will not be excised from the posts they were awarded.  Theyre willing to use Human Rights Courts to get their balls fondled, imagine what theyll do when threatened with political displacement.  We put a monkey in the drivers seat and we cant get it out now.  But forming ""new movements"" means a splintering of effort and loss of effectiveness.  I dont think there is a good answer to this problem.  I think the things that could be done to fix this would be unpalatable to everyone involved, and will never happen.  I don't think we'll ever see an alliance of ""right and left"" on this, which is what it would take to have the required political weight.  So we fracture.  Factions will form, each weaker than the previous.  I dont think this gets fixed short of dramatic change in planetary/societal conditions, ie a collapse of industrial civilization.  Until then, catgirls have the monopoly on ""our"" voices, be that women or progressives or minorities or pro-healthcare folks.  It doesn't look good.  They are not going to relinquish power, and lets be real, they will never be asked to."

90,gendercritfem,"Progressivism is good, actually. Advances in rights for women, ethnic minorities, LGB people, the poor, and the disabled have all been great things.

144,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"> I honestly don't understand this fake period BS that TiMs spout off about. 

Have you ever seen the TV show ""Dexter?""

Honestly, it's a fairly accurate representation of how psychopaths think. As Dexter goes about his life, he's always asking himself *""how would a normal person react in this situation?""* and Dexter is constantly attempting to mimic human emotion, when the truth is that he's just a blank automaton. Being a psychopath is very much like being a robot. Mark Zuckerberg is an obvious example, he's just a complete robot. *""The Social Network""* did a wonderful job of capturing that.

Now, understanding all of that, *what if you were a psychopath who was attempting to pass as a woman?* You would do all the things that you've seen women do. And that's what a lot of these TiMs are mimicking; they're acting out the things that they've seen their sisters do, or their mothers do. It's the reason they have this weird disconnect from human morality. No sane woman would throw a pool party with topless twelve year olds, but a male psychopath would."

Because every new cell formed in the body has the possibly of malfunctioning, going rogue and multiplying rapidly. Which is the definition of a cancerous cell.

Women in the past were pregnant much more often during their lifetime, and many doctors think the modern woman may be at higher risk for ovarian cancer due to hundreds of more periods during their reproductive years. So many of them *recommend* skipping periods if your birth control allows it.

Hormonal birth control has it own issues for a lot of women, but if you're already using it successfully without terrible side effects, don't listen to the scare tactics telling you to take the sugar week and get your period if you don't get any peace of mind out of it. *A lot* of researchers think it lowers your lifetime risk for ovarian cancer."
160,GCchick,"I'm the same. I enjoy my periods even when they're painful because it connects me to my body and... without wanting to sounds to newagey, it connects me to nature. I also feel closer to women, past present and future. There's something really beautiful about periods. I could never relate to the women that said they hated them, or wish they didn't have any. I know that my best friend also feels the same as me, so we're not alone!"

It wasn't just a side effect that they didn't' bother to fix either, it was a deliberate addition. A deliberate addition of medically unnecessary pain and bleeding. It was either included as an attempt to avoid freaking out Catholics (who would not appreciate the lifting of ""Eve's curse""), or because the people who invented it thought that women wouldn't be able to wrap their tiny little lady brains around the idea of something that temporarily makes you infertile also temporarily stopping your period, depending on what source you believe."

> This portion of my decision addresses Ms. Yaniv’s complaints against Blue Heaven Beauty Lounge and Ms. Benipal, Ms. DaSilva, Ms. Tran, Ms. Dulay, and Merle Norman. In each of these cases, the Respondents advertised the service of “brazilian waxing”, and it was this service which Ms. Yaniv attempted to book. These cases raise two common issues at the outset: (1) what service was Ms. Yaniv requesting, and (2) does this service constitute a brazilian wax, such that it is one the Respondents were customarily providing to the public.  In this section, I address each of these issues in turn, and then go on to apply my findings to each individual complaint.    
>  
>9 A.The service Ms. Yaniv was requesting Ms. Yaniv does not dispute that she was requesting that these Respondents wax her genitals. In this unique context, her genitals were therefore relevant to her complaints – specifically to the question of whether the Respondents customarily provided the type of genital waxing that she was requesting. Throughout the hearing, however, Ms. Yaniv refused to answer questions about her genitals and argued that such questions were inappropriate. Given her representation to various Respondents that she had “male parts”, has not “gone through surgery”, and “was born a man now I’m a woman”, the hearings initially proceeded on the understanding that she has a penis and scrotum, and that she was therefore requesting waxing of the scrotum. However, under cross examination she was evasive on the issue, referring to “whatever is down there”. In the Blue Heaven hearing on July 4, she insinuated that she may be intersex but refused to say whether she was. Asked to explain what she meant when she told Ms. Benipal she had “male parts”, she testified simply “I mean male parts”.  On July 17, in the hearing against Ms. DaSilva, Ms. Yaniv testified that she had “male genitals”. Moments later, she testified, for the first time, that she is intersex. She said again that she had “male parts” and then added that she had “other stuff”, though she initially refused to say whether that included a vulva. She denied, for the first time, that she had asked Ms. DaSilva to wax a scrotum. Ms. Yaniv refused to answer questions put to her by Ms. DaSilva’s counsel, and so I intervened:   
>  
>Tribunal:   Ms. Yaniv, it’s relevant to this complaint. ... The question is, what were you asking Ms. DaSilva to wax?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  I was asking for a female genital waxing wax .... A brazilian wax.   
>  
>Tribunal:  ... Forget brazilian, brozilian, male, female, whatever – what body part were you asking her to ask?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  The genitals, the genital region.   
>  
>Tribunal:  Their defence hinges on a defence that they, that she, is not comfortable waxing a scrotum. So are you talking about a scrotum, or are you talking about a vulva, or are you talking about both?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  The second one.   
>  
>Tribunal:  Vulva?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  Yes.   
>  
>Tribunal:  ... You’re saying you were asking her to wax a vulva? Ms. Yaniv:   
>  
> Yes. ... I’m not gonna say whether I have the whole thing. I’ll say it exists.  
>  
> At this point, Mr. Cameron asked Ms. Yaniv to submit to an independent medical examination to verify her genitals. I refused to make such an order, on the basis that it was unduly intrusive and disproportionate to the issues at stake.  I am satisfied, based on Ms. Yaniv’s representations to the Respondents that she has “male parts”, “used to be a boy”, and has not “gone through surgery yet”, as well as her evidence in these hearings that she has “male parts”, that Ms. Yaniv was seeking to have hair removed from a scrotum. Whether or not she may also have a vulva is not ultimately determinative of any issue in this complaint and so I do not need to engage further with that question"

> However, I find that Ms. Yaniv’s predominant motive in filing her waxing complaints is not to prevent or remedy alleged discrimination, but to target small businesses for personal financial gain. In many of these complaints, she is also **motivated to punish racialized and immigrant women based on her perception that certain ethnic groups, namely South Asian and Asian communities, are “taking over”** and advancing an agenda hostile to the interests of LGBTQ+ people. These motives are not consistent with the Code’s purposes, and in particular its purpose of promoting a climate of understanding and mutual respect, where all are equal in dignity and rights: s.

In my view, the most likely scenario is that Ms. Yaniv was trying to make Ms. Benipal feel uncomfortable or awkward for her own amusement or as a form of revenge. This is consistent with Ms. Yaniv’s behaviour in relation to all of the Respondents. ""

Rather, I find that the only reason that Ms. DaSilva cancelled the appointment was because she found Ms. Yaniv’s behaviour troubling and deceptive – which it was. ""

What if he was targeting white women who don’t belong to religious organizations? What if he was offering to donate any money awarded him to charity? Would the court still have ruled this way?

By forcing other people to spend time memorizing 700+ new genders and pronouns, then doxxing/shamjng them for making a mistake - you are acting in bad faith. This has become a weaponized version of social justice that is used to feed the ""outrage culture"" that has become so popular."

It's the same ""why won't women have sex with meeeee?  Why aren't they hopping on my dick?  They're so shallow!"" reasoning by males like Joseph8276 and Chris-chan, but women are supposed to pretend that it's somehow different this time because it's a *Woke* incel rant instead of a *regular* incel rant, so instead of the speaker just ranting at women for not having sex with him, we get a speaker ranting at women for not having sex with him *and* comparing it to actual oppression.  I'm sure an activist like Rosa Parks would *love* to hear how someone not having sex with you is the same thing as Jim Crow laws.

I think even in the trans community that’s been discussed to the point of death. 

Misogyny and the objectification of women lends to TIFs passing, too. People see short hair/pants and assume man; if you’re not performing femininity you must be a dude. When I cut my hair into a pixie last year, I definitely felt that shift."

Studies reporting similar results to this poll:

**MtF transgender persons' self-reported lifetime incidence of autogynephilic arousal**

|Study|Non-homo/AGP|Non-homo/Non-AGP|% Non-homo/AGP|Homo/AGP|Homo/Non-AGP|% Homo/AGP|
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Blanchard (1985)|46|17|73%|15|85|15%|
|Blanchard et al. (1987)|60|13|82%|5|47|10%|
|Lawrence (2005)|181|21|90%|3|9|25%|
|Smith et al. (2005)|40|27|60%|5|29|15%|
|Nuttbrock et al. (2011)|131|48|73%|90|301|23%|
|Totals|458|126|78.4%|118|471|20.0%|

* 78.4% of 584 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual acknowledged at least one lifetime incidence of autogynephilic arousal, compared to just 20% MtF subjects classified as homosexual.

* In four of the five studies (Lawrence excluded) reporting MtF subjects' history of transvestic fetishism, 73% of 382 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual reported at least one lifetime episode of transvestic fetishism, compared to just 20% MtF subjects classified as homosexual.

* In Lawrence's (2005) study of of 232 MtF transsexuals patients who underwent SRS, 90% of 202 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual reported at least one lifetime episode of autogynephilic arousal, with median and modal frequencies of hundreds of episodes or more. Of the 12 MtF subjects classified as homosexual, only 3 (25%) reported at least on episode one lifetime episode of autogynephilic arousal, and ""the median and modal number of episodes homosexual participants reported were both never.""

* In Nuttbrock's et al. (2011) study, 40% of the exclusively homosexual MtF group began HRT during adolescence, compared to just 1% of the heterosexual MtF group and 14% of the bisexual MtF group. Thus validating Blanchard's observation that homosexual MtF transsexuals present for clinical assessment at a significantly younger age than non-homosexual MtF transsexuals. Furthermore, 82% of exclusively gynephilic MtF subjects reported a history of transvestic fetishism, compared to just 14% of MtF subjects who had started HRT during adolescence."

482,Mentalink,"That's not exactly what it is; it's not about people changing sex, it's about people becoming aware of/accepting that they are transgender, as in, that their gender identity does not correspond to their assigned gender at birth. It's just a cute way of saying it. Coming out of the egg, it's a bit like coming out of the closet except it's for gender identity and not sexuality. Nothing disrespectful about it... or if you think it is I'd like to understand why. Either way the vast majority of trans people have no problem with it, so there's no need to get offended on our behalf."

Changing your gender expression wouldn't require surgery or HRT. If you are doing that you are trying to change your *sex* [even though humans can't actually do that, most transpeople falsely believe that they can change sex.].

Birds are hatched, implying the opposite sex is equivalent to unintelligent animals is very disrespectful, do you really need that explained to you in such detail?

We love to insult ourselves.

Seriously, are you really that daft? Jesus Christ. And you people say we're the ones getting offended for no reason. 

And about your first point, it's missing mine entirely, and not worth responding to; you went on this rant about how changing sex and gender aren't the same thing even though I never implied that they were. All I said is that the ""egg"" analogy applies to gender identity and not to sex change.

Also, you know it's not only birds who lay eggs right? Not that it matters cause either way it's just an analogy but the mental gymnastics you did to be offended by it impress me."
499,livipup,"That analogy with birds is a bit of a stretch. And, well, sex is complicated. There are things scientifically recognized as primary sexual characteristics which can naturally change throughout a person's lifetime or are even expected to. It's also possible to be born with these primary sexual characteristics mismatched. There's even research suggesting that trans people are neurologically intersex. I think the egg idea is a bit weird, but I don't believe that it reflects anyone's views of non-trans people at all."

Yes. IME HSTS get even more visibility.  Within trans activism, they collaborate, too: Laverne Cox raised money for an imprisoned child killer rapist. Calpernia Addams and Lynn Conway. Among many examples. outside of trans activism,[they still flip out over pronouns, want children transed, claim they're the only ""true women"", can be awful to women and gay men.](https://i.imgur.com/U25SAN1.png) (that includes those who associate themselves with GC feminists)."
504,livipup,"I've met a lot of lesbians who are open to dating trans women. Maybe it's just a younger generation thing, can't say for sure. Some are only open to post-op trans women but others are open to both even if they aren't open to cisgender men."

506,livipup,"I can't imagine there are too many people on Reddit who are qualified to decide if a peer-reviewed study is valid or not and who also care what a small percentage of the population does with their bodies, so I think we just have to trust scientists when so many of them start saying the same thing. Unless maybe there are just as many or more saying something different. The APA and WHO both seem to have accepted that it's at least not a part of someone's sexuality and they're generally pretty trustworthy. I don't agree with everything they claim, but I do assume they know better than I do."

508,TrueJacksonVP,"These women are likely bi or pan if they are attracted to pre-op penis in any way, shape, or form. 

This is the problem we as lesbians are currently facing. Lesbians cannot find a penis attractive, that’s *why* we’re lesbians. Otherwise we’d likely be open to dating men or pre-op transwomen. We’d also be *bisexual* for it. 

The girls claiming “I’m a lesbian and *I* like girl dick, so all you other lesbians are being close minded and transphobic” are a huge part of the problem right now. I as a lesbian *cannot* force myself to like penises and their functions. They psychically turn me off. I don’t even enjoy penetration. Yet I’ve been told that I’m transphobic and close minded for not being open to girl penis. If a straight male said this to me, it’d be considered homophobic. No one would *ever* demand a gay man accept their vagina. Genitalia is an important part of sexuality and for some is *the* most important part. Transbians have no right to demand penis acceptance from an established group of women who hate penis. Most of the transbians I’ve encountered have no desire for bottom surgery and still like their penis. But they rarely fuck each other — which really tells you all you need to know. 

Right now a lot of bisexuals and straight women are appropriating lesbian culture and identity because it’s somehow “cooler” or “easier” to just cut and dry state they’re a lesbian than explain the intricacies of their own sexuality. I understand why they might, but this in turn damages “actual” lesbians who are not afforded the same leniencies in terms of our rigid sexualities. If you’re a lesbian who likes penis, you’re not a lesbian haha. And people get really angry when you gatekeep their identity (even though they do not fit the “requirements” for the identity they’ve chosen). They then damage the perception of lesbians because of attitudes like “well she *was* a lesbian and now she’s dating Rob, so I guess they all secretly want the D”. We don’t. 


Sorry for the novel and that’s not at all directly at you, it’s just extremely frustrating to be a cis lesbian in this day and age. It was easier a decade ago — which is mind blowing. As gay men and trans folk progress, lesbian identity had become watered down and appropriated by men with fetishes, entitled/upset transwomen, and bisexuals who don’t realize the damage they’re doing by claiming to be a lesbian while harboring attraction towards dick."
509,corny_reptile,">Save

You are moving the goal posts. The claim was that primary sex characteristics naturally change and trans people are ""neurologically intersex."" I don't think the WHO and APA are saying anything of the sort. Sure a penis or a vulva will change with puberty but they don't naturally change from one to the other! That's absurd."

604,SureSureFightFight,"NORMAL DOES NOT MEAN GOOD.

I'm so fucking sick of ""Everyone does it, so it's normal and healthy!""

Nobody says murder is healthy, and yet it's a 'normal' part of human society. Nobody says theft is healthy, and yet it's perfectly normal to want to take things that don't belong to you (as in, everyone's thought it, not ""everyone is a kleptomaniac""). 

For most of human history, rape was normal and yet everyone agrees that rape is fucking horrible.


And you know what? The guy isn't even right. Out of seven billion people you can find a lot of people with incestuous feelings, but statistically it is **rare**. It is **not normal**. Anyone who has taken a college sociology class can tell you that there are so many psychological safeguards in place to prevent that.


And hey, I know you're probably reading this and have all sorts of prepared arguments to regurgitate, so let me just tell you:

**I don't care.** Your bullshit is so obvious a mile off, and anyone not tainted by your delusion can see it.


And lastly,

>Akin to bullying, but I'm used to it

It's not bullying, it's holding you up as an example to make sure nobody else becomes a creepy pervert. Just like all the other 'bullies' have been doing with you.

Everyone goes through stuff. Most people don't jack off in another person's underwear. If you are so afraid of 'feeling ashamed', maybe there is a good reason for that."

Protip: If you're 20 years old, and you want a girlfriend, the easiest way to get one is *to ask a girl out.* You can lift weights until you're blue in the face, but if you don't actually ask a girl out, you're wasting your time.

She NEVER asked him what his penis is until when she was about 4 ish and saw her little cousin naked and saw he had one too, obviously, being a sane person we simply told her that boys have a penis.  As she got older we got her a book about bodies that explains anatomy and sex and periods in child friendly terms (she hides it under her bed but approaches me occasionally to ask for clarification).

This man should tell his child the truth. He’s a male and so he has a penis. If his dysphoria isn’t bad enough that he’s able to keep and use his penis to impregnate his wife surely he can tell his child what a penis is and what it’s used for?

Like if they are trying to teach about the birds and the bees then they do t ever need to mention their own bits. Technically my parents never confirmed anything like that, it was explained in terms of “This is how humans reproduce. Flowers reproduce this way, animals reproduce that way”.

Do they think their child wants to know what they have? Or is it an issue of no boundaries where there should be quite a few important ones?"

I really want to ask women here with kids because even in the rare instance the conversation came up THIS early, why is it so necessary the 2 year old knows what to call HIS DAD'S SPECIFIC GENITALIA.  Certainly you don't teach genitalia by using your own as an example????? That's abuse!!!

Most kids will just ask ""what's that"", get a straight answer, and then get on with their day, but I can imagine that if these parents have been very cagey and refused to answer, then it's understandable that the kid wouldn't be satisfied and keep pushing it."
827,Amareldys,"Eh, my daughter got to an age where she would point at a penis in the changing room (women often bring their young sons to changing rooms here) and say ""Poop!"".

842,applestrudelterf,"I took it up mean the kid has seen ‘mummy’s’ willy, probably at bath time or something, and asked what it was, which is why they need to find a different word other than penis etc. But you’re right, they will have to teach the kid about the birds and the bees at some point, In which case it’s either abusive or absolutely hilarious because the kid will either be hopelessly confused, OR, they’ll recognise straight away that the penis in the educational book they just read looks *exactly* like ‘mummy’s girldick’ and they’ll keep questioning and questioning until they suss this shit out for themselves and peak trans themselves... the more I think about it the more I think the latter could actually happen since kids are notorious for cutting straight past the bulls hit and seeing clearly where adults are clouded by ideology and  social graces. It was after all a child that pointed out the emperors new clothes - and I know it’s only fiction, but there is a reason it was a child and it’s because they are good at this sort of thing."

But if hes literally tugging on the foreskin, refusing to stop, and saying things like ""no one plays with me so I play with my penis"" (LITERALLY just read this in a mommy blog cause i had to look this shit up).

859,throwaway275445,All countries used to require surgery. In the UK to get a gender recognition cert you still have to be looking into surgery but people just do that to con the panel then once they have the GRC they forget all about it and just boost online about being a legal women with a dick.
860,SometimesJacka,They require srs to legally transition that’s how they become ‘sterilized’. They just have a much higher barrier to entry generally.

Or at least if there should be a minimum latency period, like you can’t raise a kid until after 10 years minimum since you legally became trans. That way the craziness might be somewhat gone.

This topic wouldn’t go over well at all,  but if you KNOW a group has a very high chance of being mentally ill one way or another, wouldn’t it be prudent to perhaps not let them freely be in control of kids?"

883,Comfycodone,"Theres a lot of problems with even attempting to bring something like this to a panel. One such problem is the fact that you dont have to be trans to be mentally unstable and have kids. Plenty of GC people are too mentally unstable to raise children, but they have children anyway. Should we take away the children from these people as well? If so, then it's not really a debate on trans people, but mentally unstable people in general. But then that leads to the problem of ""assuming"" that trans people are mentally unstable, which is not a hot topic for discussion in the PC world we live in. Because of this, people just wont hear it. They'll turn their ears off to it or scream and yell until the topic is removed from discussion. 

But even if we were able to get this discussion into the public forum, they would want proof that a child raised in a trans household is at risk of becoming mentally ill. This leads to even more problems, because even if that child ends up becoming trans, the trans community will just say ""THEY WERE BORN THAT WAY ITS NOT THE PARENTS FAULT"" or if they do become mentally ill then it's because ""SOCIETY BULLIED THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR TRANS PARENTS"". They will find a way to draw the narrative to represent their own agenda, and the faceless masses will agree with them so they dont appear to be oppressive shitlords. 

Honestly, it's just not worth the fuss. It's for the best that we quietly seethe to ourselves and circlejerk our distaste for the mental illness known as transgenderism amongst ourselves."

People with creepy sexual fetishes that they expose on other members of society outside of their bedrooms and TRULY consenting partners (not the whole “my husband likes this thing and it creeps me out but I do it anyway because marriage) should be evaluated before children are allowed in their care. These parents are parenting a toddler and literally going to tell the kid that dad excuse me “mom” has a “big clit”? Are you fucking kidding me?

The term ""genderqueer"" was also just synonymous for ""gender neutral"" or ""gender nonconforming"", none of which are modifiers of male and female genders and not used as its own 3rd+ gender until tumblr.

Nonbinary being used as its own gender separate from male and female is entirely a tumblr thing too. Its origin is mostly used by tumblrinas who think that not liking pink and femininity makes them the ultimate #notlikeothergirls, which they call nonbinary.

That's normal, but for a child to randomly ask what moms genitals are without a reason like your example, and what they're used for, at two years old means they already heard this in conversation before or were coached. No 2 year old just walks up and randomly asks about someone else's genitals and their use without getting the idea from an adult or some type of media.

I don't doubt that tumblrinas with their made-up ""Queer"" genders/sexualities like ""biosexual demigender starfluid flameboy"" believed in this ridiculous nonsense even before tumblr existed; this is how they managed to worm their way into LGB in the first place by pretending they're some oppressed fake gender/sexuality that the think makes them just like LGB, when they aren't.

932,applestrudelterf,"I’m sorry but that’s a really weird conclusion to come to. If a child sees a body part on their parent - especially when it’s one they haven’t got themselves - it would be quite natural to ask what it is, especially if, as seems to be the case here, they know the names of all the other body parts but their parents have avoided mentioning one in particular.

Men are dogs. Gay men are dogs with no leash. And  I include trans people in this. Trans 'women' mostly seem to go with other trans 'women' which basically means its two gay men. So the 'extreme' aspect comes into play again. There is a distinct lack of feminine energies involved. Couple this with how porn tends towards making people go slowly more and more extreme in order to hit the same 'high'. And well. It can be a recipe for disaster."

In 2019 alone, a whole 18 have been murdered with 15 left unsolved.

They just get banned periodically and then a new one pops up to repeat the cycle

I think we have to admit that the project of this sub fundamentally goes against Reddit's core beliefs, and they will be looking for any reason to ban us. While I agree we shouldn't hand them that reason, we shouldn't be too zealous in our moderation either, as people here express frustration or disgust they are not able to express irl.

Trans ideology labels our belief that they are not women as violence in itself anyway, no matter how much we sugar coat it. When Reddit admins inevitably accept that premise, we'll be banned, so why take extra measures to prevent it?"

1190,Simulationth3ry,"Porn for women is generally softer and more romantic. So because soft and romantic= woman, that makes you a woman? No. It just means you want to watch something more romantic. God these people do everything to convince themselves that they’re valid."

1198,K-Tech2,"I think it's so weird because a large amount of Female PH accounts are actually men. Either because they're too pretentious for ""MtF"", or as a way to stay more anonymous, or as a joke or a ""why not""."

When you watch porn, there's a good chance you are watching someone being raped."
1200,arealbigboss,"They’re porn addicts who mostly have a complete lack of real sexual experience, it’s what drives their AGP. If these people were to lay off porn, socialize more, and maybe find partners/be more honest about their sexuality they’d never even think about being trans."

I find it very easy to tell the difference most of the time, and I imagine a lot of other women do too. But men seem to find it very challenging.

for this reason, I would guess that most content on r/menwritingwomen is submitted by women. 

It would be very interesting to see a study where the authors asked people to guess what gender random posts were written by, and see if women are more likely to correctly guess posts written by other women, and vice versa for men given posts written by other men."

And after you are beaten, have your teeth knocked out, or worse- *you* will be questioned for a human rights violation. You will be asked: What did *you do* to make him hit you? Just like 50 years ago when a man beat the hell out of his wife, and **she** was blamed for making him angry.

If he says you misgendered him, you'll not only get beaten but also jailed after. Do you think your job will be waiting when you get out? Who will take care of your kids, pets, and other responsibilities when you are unexpectedly attacked and then locked up?

1419,Krombopulos-Snake,"But this is exactly what happens on Reddit. The idea of letting people have their own things , even if you don't agree with them is no longer allowed anymore.

Put it like this. 
loli and shota, drawings get banned for being harmful to minors meanwhile, several of the transboards that specifically target real children and lure them into their creepy discords are still up. You know, I feel I shouldn't have to make the distinction between real and imaginary children but the way Reddit has been lately makes me do so.

Side note: I absolutely hate discord.  I just want to talk about/ play video games, not listen to mostly false, sometimes true stories of debauchery. Anyway.

A board about irrationally hating women is shut down, but any of the multiple boards about irrationally hating men are allowed to thrive - - *until they start hating transwomen!* THEN , it's time to shut them down. 

Name and shame is not allowed, until it's allowed.

Witchhunting is a global rule, it's just not allowed on this site---- until there are several boards completely dedicated to witch hunting and stalking. My favorite one, the one that's been stalking me for a year now finally got quarantined. Only after they targeted a fucking child - now they've been reduced to Frenworld nonsense trying to avoid being banned all together. 
This is noteworthy because for far too long this sub was above all the rules of Reddit. 

Being a pretend Communist is perfectly fine on Reddit, being a pretend Nazi is not. 
Even though both groups rounded up and killed people who disagreed, but don't say that on the commie subs. They'll have you hanged for that.

A board saying mean things about a billionaire liberal is considered a conspiracy board and shut down meanwhile, a board saying mean things about a billionaire conservative is considered normal and is allowed to operate. Fun Fact:* Both these men are terrible people and the fact that users on Reddit actually believe either of them are ""good guys"" is actually frightening to me.*

A board about how to get opiates is shut down - -yet several boards about how to get weed, cocaine and even make your own ""party favors""*Disclaimer: We do not condone or endorse this stuff, Safety not guaranteed* --  are still up and running. 

**Let's not even get into the endless amount abuse that the user verification systems have fostered over the years due to mods being sick , abusive assholes on the porn subs.**

A board of white people being racist assholes in the name of  politics is allowed to stay up while a board of white people being racist assholes just because they can, gets shut down.

tl;dr people like to pretend reddit is fair and just. 

Ultimately it's just a large chan with shittier rules than a regular chan - but unlike chans, people cannot play nice on reddit and just keep to their own circlejerks. They have to branch out and shut down other people's circlejerks in order to make themselves feel better.

But you know what?  I do not care about these subs. What I do care about is that all of them have the right to exist.  I know people hate me over the color of my skin, getting rid of their board doesn't change anything. 

I know people hate me over my opinions, boo hoo. I should still be able to post them and if someone feels like it, they should be able to argue with me without getting interrupted or brigaded or stopped by a pissy mod who doesn't like my colorful choice of words.

You can't have a real discussion if you surround yourself with people who only agree with you and nothing is honest when you force people to agree with you or risk losing their right to even post."

Who cares what specifically caused the dysphoria to occur in your mind? Who cares whether it was caused by society treating them badly or if it was caused by them watching too much porn or whatever? Lots of people aren't treated nicely by society and lots of people watch porn. Neither of these things directly cause dysphoria, because the majority of people who watch porn or get treated poorly by society don't start thinking that they can just declare themselves the opposite gender. 

It is ultimately still a problem with the individual. Lots of random psychopaths and serial killers experienced abuse and ostracism by society too. Are we supposed to blame society being meanies as the cause of everything's fault? No, we blame these psychopaths and serial killers for **choosing** to be shitty humans. I blame trans people for having the audacity and delusion they can just **choose** to become whatever the fuck gender they want to be and expect society to go along with it ""because society are meanies who have oppressed me"".

No one gives a flying fuck about some random persons innate gender soul and no one dates or has sex based on that either. Dating is literally judgement.

I talked to a guy in long-term psychosis a few days ago and he was convinced that 1) 10-years-future-him could only change him 2) if someone wanted to help him it would only work if they did it 'right' 3) he couldn't articulate what would be the right kind of help and blamed the government (a continuation of the Nazis) for sending agents to cockblock him.

I blame trans people for having the audacity and delusion they can just choose to become whatever the fuck gender they want to be and expect society to go along with it ""because society are meanies who have oppressed me"".

Not everyone has the option to talk about it with someone in their life of course and I get that, but the calmer posts around here have the right it that that some people are approaching gender in a fetishistic way. Not all, I dont think- I disagree with this sub on some of that- but I do think it is good to open the discussion to their being not one solution for everyone struggling with their gender in some way, shape, or form. My goal is to provide some support to these people but not through stereotyping fantasies of how the other sex ""works"" or fetishism encroaching on other public norms (e.g. underwear worn publically, etc).

Disagree. 

Are there shitty trans people? Of course there are. But there are also many, many trans people who are just imperfect humans trying to find their way in the world like all the rest of us.

1646,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"I think that if you have a fetish, *nothing else does it for you.*

Here's an example:

A few years back, my wife and I decided to check out the ""swinger"" scene. Our expectation was that people in the scene would be having tons of sex. Much to our surprise, a lot of the men in the scene can't get it up anymore. We went to a couple parties, and it was full of women getting tied up in BDSM gear, but nobody was actually fucking. I watched some dude get blown for nearly an hour, and he couldn't get erect enough to penetrate his partner.

Another thing I noticed about the scene, was that we were literally the only people in a conventional relationship. Everyone else was poly or divorced.

I definitely wondered if their pursuit of a fetish led to the end of their relationships."

It's called puberty.

My detransition has been very successful so I'm one of the lucky ones and feel a moral obligation I guess to warn others. Including those who do it for fetish reasons because I'm not devoid of compassion. There are a lot of reasons people get sucked into transitioning and people who want to live out their fetish 24/7 are not in a healthy place. But mainstream LGBTQ+ culture is enabling it all."

I am a female who is comfortable with her female body but I have struggled with depression and anxiety and I am a former cutter. I think a lot of what bothers me is sexual reassignment surgery feels a lot like mutilation to me. Were you offered therapy by anyone before they tried to persuade you to transition? Honestly I am all for people doing whatever they want with their lives as long as it doesn’t hurt other people but when I hear about children transitioning it makes me angry. I wonder if trans gendered people want to recruit more people To validate their own choices.

A few people did ask if I had perused therapy, but they were mostly drown out by the massive call of people telling me I'm actually trans.

I think the thing with the trans community is that they want to be supportive, but don't know how to approach the question of therapy. If you find a therapist who is not trans friendly then you're ""just hurting the person more by denying them of their true body"" or something like that, and that's oppressive, and we can't have that. 

But at the same time you need a therapist who will make you seriously consider your choices and make you question if you actually want to transition. It's a delicate line that professionals have a hard time walking, so I can't imagine the internet walking it well. So they just go full on supportive and hope for the best.

Ok. I can tell you though, as an actual female, that no group of women ever sat there talking about womanhood being a sliding scale, or thought that having a penis would make them better or more deserving women than those who didn't ""earn it""(LOLOLOLOL). Its just so typical. They are MRA in drag. Its pretty damn male to just decide their ego matters more than what being a woman actually IS. Or any what comes along with being female either physically or socially... somehow never has anything to do with womenhood, because they personally can't experience it.  Their obsessive coveting is all of womanhood and more, hahaha. Narcissists."

I don't know about gay men but trans people would definitely feel better if they just admitted they were gay. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Being trans, you'll never have sex with a straight man, will never be feminine, will always be a laughingstock outside of the media and the internet.

At least as far as mtfs go, I thought the concept was you were born with a female brain in a male body, or something close to that. However, I don't think people even care about that anymore. It seems to be more about incels pushing hormones onto other incels, a warped sense of how females operate, and fetishizing the idea of being a woman.

The female version of himself (the real version, not his teeny bopper cat girl fantasy) would resemble a sister or other close relative.  Can you say incest?  That's both disgusting and evolutionarily counter productive.

The atmosphere doesn't help today where anyone can see retarded memes like thigh-highs being called programming socks, and mtfs pushing this idea that somehow being trans means you're 150 IQ and better than those dumby regular males, it's cringe as hell.

Poster could very well go off, throw a hissy fit, lawyer up, and potentially sue doctor. Doctor will get a stiff (it is bad joke day🥳) letter from their HR telling them that they are transphobic and that they should apologize and review the diagnosis or else. Doctor may then be dismissed nonetheless. Such cases are commonplace in other fields.

The DSM has already been changed to accommodate the trans movement. Medical standards have already been rephrased, reshaped and distorted. That’s one of the main reasons I’m no longer silent about what’s happening. I am all for people expressing themselves, but not at the expense of reality or sound medical practice.

From a personal experience, I was misdiagnosed with something a few years back. Basically what happened is that I saw an in-training doctor, described a symptom, and she immediately gave me a prescription without any further explanation. I thought it was weird, but mostly forgot about it, until 2 years later when I saw another doctor and she asked how my (insert medical condition I don't have) was doing, and I was like ""what? I don't have that"" Turns out that first doctor must've put down that I had that condition when she gave me the prescription, but after I explained that no, I was confident I didn't have any symptoms of that, it didn't seem to be too much of a big deal and I've never been asked about it since.

No idea if it's still on my record, but even if it is, it's not a big deal for me to explain that it was a fuck-up, and no, I've never even taken that medication prescribed because I don't need it."

The other one featured a dude who obviously liked to play dress up who worked in a law firm, if memory serves me. This was when they had to go thru stages of living as a ‘woman’ for a period of time before they were granted surgery.

That means I go in and out of lots of clinics and work with staff in lots of drs offices that provide therapy services too. 

The amount of similarity between the opioid epidemic, starting with Purdue pressing oxycontin on the public, and companies pushing hormones now is scary.

For example, if someone diagnoses you with a panic disorder, you could have heart attack symptoms taken less seriously in the ER.

All three had it back before transition on demand became the norm, and they still regretted it eventually. And if I remember right, all three were abused as children.

It's very clear these young women have zero idea what they're doing to their body permanently. 

Most of them I speak with are just normal lesbians. I dont understand when they try to bro out with me and comment on my new boots or truck or facial hair. The whole thing seems like a social contagion. I think the pharma industry is directly responsible. If hormones weren't being pushed so hard nobody would want to cut off their sexual organs to try to look like the other sex... because they'd never even pass a little.

it really doesn't seem unlikely, especially if the medical secretary involved doesn't really know this area. ive had a (male ofc) medical secretary send a letter confirming i have ""diaorreah"" not ""dysmenorrhea"". afaik its not even a job that requires any medical qualifications."
2228,HormelBrapocalypse,Don't these kinds of things are normally pretty esoteric to those not familiar with healthcare and modern health IT.  Also some doctors still do all of their stuff by hand or through some horrible bastardized spreadsheet or who know what type of digital record management. For private practice single doctor it could be paper only or using a software suite. For larger facilities they almost all are on some managed records and charts system.
2229,Cinnamonsmellsnice,"I hardly think me being a medical student is irrelevant, as it gives me the unique opportunity to inspect and be critical of the medical and scientific world up close, I study in a hospital every day of the work week. I'll check out the book you mentioned. However, this is a book. Books can be good, but this is not even literature, it's a non-scientific book for the general public written by a guy that did not even study medicine but is a therapist instead. 

If you want to make bold claims like these, you'll need tens if not hundreds of proper scientific studies, along with large scale systematic reviews and meta analyses peer reviewed by experts and committees and hundreds of scientific journal clubs. 

A book written by one person is not enough, let alone it nog even being a scientific literature book."

I see a few possibilities:
1) You're a genuine idiot who thinks one book can deconstruct an entire medical system
2) You lack education and have good intentions but are unintentionally a bigot
3) You know you are wrong to think like this without any scientific evidence, but don't want to/can't realize you should change your views, because you somehow gain something from calling others' mental problems a fetish instead of respecting them. That makes you an asshole."

You can not compare that to Satanic panic nonsense, or even something like Columbine, which was a flash in the pan.

How is this even a stereotype? Have they never seen female athletes? Like, surely women's sports would be slapstick comedy if this were true. Or does this only affect manic pixie dream girl wannabes? I didn't even realise this was a ""girly"" thing."

It was so fucked up and the girl had to kick her out of the house when she woke up and the TIM was wandering around her kitchen totally nude."

2431,Ironlifeisweird,I don’t think it’s brain damage. Even people with higher amounts of hormones don’t experience brain damage. I just think they’re dillusioning themselves to a point similar to hysteria where they get these effects that don’t exist in actuality.

2437,throwaway275445,"On the contrary women are better at fine and precise motor skills while men are hamfisted. This is why in the past labour was split with women doing the fine, intricate, often decorative work which then lead to that decoration being associated with femininity."

I'm not going to share the details, but I will say that (a) I didn't enjoy it and (b) if it had involved a video being uploaded to the internet, I'm sure it would be an ongoing source of trauma for me. Guess I'm not a ~real woman.~

ETA: Oh, and one time when I was walking at night some dudes pulled up right next to the sidewalk and tried to pull me into their car. Were they just trying to scare me or actually trying to abduct me? I'm not sure, but either way I screamed bloody murder and ran away and made a police report (which of course amounted to nothing). I suppose if I were a ~real woman~, I would have let them kidnap me."

As an adult I have given up being afraid of someone peeping because my fear of being attacked or cornered in those vulnerable situations has overtaken it. 

So fuck these people who have never had to live with that very real threat their entire lives, reminded of it constantly by their terrified mothers who heard/had their own horrible stories, using our fear as their fetish. Fuck them."

Got some sicko writing me book lengths messages that **I am actually the sick and bad and stupid one** for not recognizing their fantasies as valid or some such. 

Now, I don't feed trolls. I don't pick apart the mosaic of feces they send me to point out every logical flaw or lie, I just tell them they're full of shit and move on.

You would think that if you want to call yourself “woman” maybe ask other women how we feel about this topic. I’ve never met a female woman say she wants these things, after what we’ve been through.

I’ve been kidnapped, for real. A changing room stalking and kidnapping isn’t exhibitionism! Like, what the fuck you nasty rapists. Exhibitionism occurs in a space where everyone consents to the exhibition. Public displays of sexual behavior where everyone doesn’t consent to your sexual activities is sexual assault. I don’t know what female woman would try to be seen changing in a clothing store, sounds like something a male woman would do, but if a female woman did do that, she would be a sexual offender.

Becoming female will magically fix all of these issues because girls are always pretty, happy, and perky.  . 

This is what happens when men don’t have female friends or family they’re really close with. They get their information on what women are from media like anime and movies, which of course we all know is shockingly inaccurate. They don’t see women as humans with the same issues as men, they see us as something wholly different. He’s been brainwashed.

His language is just so telling. As if being female makes you exempt from these human issues. It really highlights how they are just men with severe issues that they think women don’t have to suffer through and therefore becoming a woman will fix all their problems. 

It’s delusional and sexist. We’re not human to them. We’re an idea."

Because we bury the fuck out of our effeminate side. We suppress the personality we are naturally inclined to have because we're taught by society that we should feel different. I really, really wanted an Easy Bake Oven as a kid, but I was told it was for girls so I internalized that girl things aren't okay for me and stopped trying to get it (despite really still wanting it). This snowballs throughout life.

I wanted to sing a duet with a female friend of mine, but I couldn't because I was a guy. I didn't want to do it because romance, I wanted to do it because I love that shit and I want to sing with my friends. But being a man, that type of thing is socially uncomfortable. There's a ton of baggage that comes with it, and *boy* did the dysphoria I felt from that suck. This was before I realized I identified as a girl.

Point is, at least for me, it's not that I don't know how to be effeminate, it's that I don't know how to release it from my internal dungeon of fear that thinks acting effeminate the way I'm inclined to will do me harm."
2553,khaste,But isnt the trans movement all about not  sticking to gender norms and not have to portray yourself as a certain gender in public? You guys are all about being biologically male but calling yourselves female just for the hell of it right?

Drag queens do it. Most do it poorly but on occasion a drag queen actually gets it right. 


So men can ‘act’ like women all they want. That is definitely possible. That’s not my issue. 
My issue is when they say they “are” women. That they are actually physically female. Which is of course impossible. 

Saying you  are a woman when your sex is actually male falls under  speech (i guess). Same free speech gives me the right to still call them men. Same right of speech gives me the right to still call him Dave instead of “Stacey”. 

My issue with these men starts when they decide it isnt an act but a reality. When they decide they are now entitled to things intended for biological women (pads without Venus symbols, gynecologists, change rooms, rape shelters). 

The issue is not that they act like women. But that they demand to be treated as though they are biologically female."

I mean, wouldn’t it just be easier to fix each stuff as a man? Probably, but how could they chose the “woman is a feeing” hill to die on then. 

I have said it before and I will say it again: they are taking the wrong kind of hormones. There is no way those guys are producing enough testosterone for their male bodies to work properly. Lay off the Mountain Dew, dude, have some steak and salad, exercise, get some social classes (like dancing or cooking) to meet people. This is not a healthy approach to fix depression."

Most drag queens are just loud and obnoxious men in a wig. Some drag queens do a somewhat better job than others, less blatantly stereotypical, less over-the-top-screaming-housmaid awefulness. If they do it semi professionally, more like an actor would than the way a drag queen normally does, then i have a very grudging respect for that. If it is professional, if they know and recognize themselves that it is an act. I was on stage once playing a male, professionally playing and portraying a different sex is hard. I respect those who do it well. But only as long as they realize it is still acting. It is still pretending. They are not and will never be woman. Just the same as me being on stage as a man did not make me male.

&#x200B;

You are correct that i should not have said ""getting it right"", because obviously a man can never  get being a woman right. What i think i meant was that some drag queens do it better and less offensively stereotypical. But you are correct, they do not actually get it right. It is still an act. That is my issue. Sure they can áct like a woman all they like. But they can never be one."

2742,ukhoneybee,"Yep, but then it's a mega clit + vag, with an enlarged clitoris and  a misshapen vagina. You sometimes see this in women with CAH where they get too much DHT in utero.

I'd post links to the medical journal images, but I think that would probably get a ban under the indecent images of kids. Let's just say, it's usually a 'not one or the other, but definitely not both' scenario."
2743,ghostbart,Chris Chan stabbed his taint and called it a vagina.
2744,mymarkis666,No.
2745,AcePilotson,"O the disrespect. Women have been fighting off nasty comments about fish smells for years. And now our natural, self-cleaning vaginas are being lumped in with septic wounds. I heard my little nephew (6) saying to his older sister (8) 'you didn't wash your ""guilty"" and now it smells', as an apparent joke. I almost fainted. Boys are learning that shit propaganda so young."
2746,deadpolice,This was perfect
2747,armaliteisforlovers,Whats disgusting is anyone who would willingly engage in sex with that. What rational person would put their dick or mouth in/ on a gaping open wound.
2748,armaliteisforlovers,I thought he had already been released and that was only for having prohibited weapons.
2749,sadie_gee,"No it's not. He loves in Canada, which is up there with Sweden and the UK for having a spineless, useless judicial system and pathetic CPS. 


Also trans people have privelidge. They can get away with this horsecrap and they do. The ones who claim ""but Ah gabes up muh male profledge!!"" are mental and wrong"
2750,ukhoneybee,"I think he's probably got onto the RCMP radar and they are quietly looking through his internet history and previous life.

The longer he is out, the more rope he has to hang himself."
2751,armaliteisforlovers,At least the puppy doesn't try to fuck kids.
2752,IFARTONBABIES,What is KF?
2753,macaroniinapan,"Oh dear.  That just made me wonder.  Does he have tmi conversations with store clerks about this subject?  Like asking them for advice, what kind they use?  Does he tell the checkout clerk about his cramps?  Surely, if so, he would have been banned from stores by now, but in this pc climate, who knows?

And yes, the sooner he gets into a male prison, the better!  Though it probably won't much matter, he'll be spending so much time in AdSeg for his own protection."
2754,HateVent,Ya something fucked up going on here. Why is a 6 year old allowed to speak that way? Where did he learn it from?

2756,DegenFromLaval,"I'm sure he probably heard something along those lines elsewhere as an insult and he's just repeating it without really understanding.  What really concerns me is that he thinks ""guilty"" is a synonym for vagina."
2757,Oburcuk,There are some men who will stick their dicks into just about anything.
2758,DegenFromLaval,"Kids hear all kinds of things filtered down, and if they gather that it's insulting or vulgar they will repeat it just to try it out or to see what reaction they get. Possibly as a way of gathering information.

When I was that age I told my dad that I didn't like Van Halen because David Let Roth was a slut. I liked VH and DLR solo, but I had heard the word and knew it was some kind of swear. I was hoping that when my dad scolded me he would tell me what it meant."
2759,AcePilotson,I was guessing the playground or overheard his mother talking to his sister.
2760,DegenFromLaval,"He may have heard it elsewhere used insultingly, and was trying it out without really knowing what it meant. I used all kinds of insults at that age without understanding then because I'd heard teenagers say them."
2761,armaliteisforlovers,"Someone who willingly does that is just as sick as the person with open wound pretending that's all there is to being a woman. 

Third in the list is the doctor who swore to do no harm then performs these surgeries for profit on the mentally ill."
