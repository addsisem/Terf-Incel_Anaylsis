3,">Hahahahahaha women are so dumb!  

Jfc are we back in middle school?"
4,"Ew.

You know a part of them gets off at putting women in their place, even if that ""woman"" is themself."
5,This is like pedophilia.
6,Disgusting
7,">I started to transition because I feel that on the inside I'm truly a woman.

>I'm a dumb fucking whore"
8,"I’m doing a fucking PhD . Actually fuck off. I’ve been Fighting against this kind of shit, getting spoken to like a dumbass and infantilized my whole goddamn life. Actually fuck this. How dare they"
9,"Wait, are these the same ""dumb girls"" who have higher rates of high school and college graduation than men do?

I hate misogynists so much. I hate how far they'll go to disparage women and justify their subordination. And I hate how people who claim to want to be women are eagerly reinforcing those same stereotypes used to undermine and hurt actual women.

Like, I get that it's just a dress-up game for them, but I wish they'd realize how serious this is for actual women, and how much damage they're dealing. They're so thoughtless."
10,"A theory I have is that these boys/men wanna be able to call women dumb bitches freely but society wont let them so they think if they become ""women"" they get a pass at their misogyny."
11,How dare they use Akko for this sexist bullshit
12,"Just because you call it second puberty doesn’t mean you get to see under age girls naked and have it not be pedophilia.

16,This is bimbo fetish filtering in. Thanks porn.
17,They are self-loathing so they become the thing they hate most: women.
18,Um I don’t even get this meme. It’s fucking stupid. Ok I mean I get it but it’s fucking stupid. There.
19,Disgusting misogynists
20,"How is this shit not IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS to EVERYONE as the CRASSEST, most UNSOPHISTICATED kind of CRUDE-ASS MISOGYNY??  HOW???  HOW???"
21,"Yes, I am such a dumb girl. I can't even walk without breaking something because I walk so boobily."
22,"I got a trending notification from that sub reddit and my mom saw it, now she looks weird at me"
23,this is fucking insulting
24,tfw obvious joke is obvious
25,DAE girls are stupid idiots?
26,This is like some next level misogyny if they equate basic competence with being male.
27,"i saw this as more of a ""girl moment"" rather than ""dumb girl"" shit"
28,Calling your self a dumb woman does not make you a dumb womann.. or a woman in general
29,I don’t agree with much of this sub but oh my god do I actually hate what you’ve screenshotted. That’s just straight up sexism
30,"I don't think they're basing it on gender stereotypes (I don't think many millennials/current gen people post anime memes likely to actually belittle a womans smarts to a mans)

 I mean the way I interprate the meme is like they're much more likely to be getting off to the idea they are doing the dumb girl anime trait which tends to be ""cute"" so it makes them feel cute. So if anything alot of stuff they say can be traced back to anime stereotypes lol, the amount of woman in here right now seething to the bone are clearly thinking too deep about this holy damn."
31,"Oh dang, I can read this... guess that means I gotta start taking T now :c"
32,I used to be a good driver until I put on the makeup :(

34,Frankentits really got me
35,We can certainly *hope* that this is the end. I'm not nearly as optimistic as you are in that regard.
36,They have the mentality of a middle schooler
37,"They eroticize the dominance and subordination of their female selves, but I think this is largely because they're incels and aren't given any other outlets for their desire to dominate. Anything they do to their ""girlsonas"" is something they will do to actual women as soon as they get the chance."
38,lol
39,"That's the next step, any day now."
40,"My mother was a high level sharpshooter( do decades since the last time she shoot so not sure how her aim is now) , a master theologians , a certified accountant and a restaurant  owner and main chef. Women are not sub-men, we are all valid peoples( unless you count perverts , murderers and any things like that, peoples that indulge in such are horrible being deserving to be shunned and removed from society)"
41,"> They're so thoughtless.

Men in general aren't socialized to worry about anyone but themselves.  It's only natural they'd throw feminism out the window.  Smh."
42,"""Transgenderism"" is the 21st century version of minstrel shows.

Except at least nobody made black people back then tell the blackface actors how Brave and Stunning they were."
43,"Their whole game of pretend is pure misogyny.  They take the most offensive stereotypes of women and girls, and make it their entire persona, and then they go out to get ""validated"" so that they can experience ""gender euphoria"" and masturbate.  They turn themselves into objects of what they think the female experience is, just to get themselves extra horny.  

This is why I don't want TIMs in the women's bathroom.  I don't need a man much stronger than me who is getting off on being in the women's bathroom around me when I am half dressed.  It's horrifying."
44,"they all seem to have some kind of humiliation/degradation fetish too

which obviously goes hand in hand with womanhood since the ~natural order~ states that women just love getting slapped about by men 🙄"
45,"My exact thought. I always get especially annoyed when I see them use our pure sweet Akko for their fetish. 

#JusticeForAkko"
46,Yes.
47,this is clearly wrongthink please desist

51,"Yeah, it’s weird. There’s this “Men-Ophelus” region of the brain that only men have, but can somehow completely grow independently with a boost of testosterone (and vice versa, deteriorated without it). This area of the brain is responsible for:

Balance

Feel of gravity

Critical thinking

Comprehension of sight

Proprioception

And essentially anything more complex than cellular resuscitation and hormone usage. Good thing we have men to take care of the practically disabled women, amirite?"

55,"They also talk disturbingly much about defeating their opponents (whoever they are) then forcibly feminising them and forcing them to do submissive stuff. These guys are sick in the head, amd i partly blame hentai amd it's weird tropes for this."

(their logic, not mine)"
57,"Unfortunately my mother had her life destroyed by men who used her and put her down. She could have been a great artist but abusive partners destroyed her self esteem. I’ll be fucking  dead before I let that happen to me or any of the women around me ever again,"

68,"I really want to write a post about transgenderism as toxic masculinity (i.e. the simultaneous will to dominate and humiliate others, and to turn that same abuse inwards when they fail to fulfill the standards of hegemonic masculinity)."
69,">deemed themselves a ""failed man""

In a recent hontrapoints video he said (and I'm paraphrasing through a quote I heard elsewhere because I don't make a habit of watching psuedointellectuals in fetish gear) if you can't handle being a man you should throw in the towel and become a woman. This quote really highlights the mindset that he and a lot of transcels have, that becoming a woman is giving up. He let the mask slip there for a moment and let it be known that he views being a man as taking an active role and being a woman is a passive role after they ""give up"". These people have a really warped world view, it's a shame that they have such a bully pulpit in academia where they can preach this nonsense."
70,"My mother was a soldier( i wrote about her being a sharpshooter.)but she had to leave the army when she got pregnant, had to take the entire blame and forced to stay mute about the whole deal so to not damage the dude and the army reputation.She often mention how she miss her days in the army, also im 99% sure it was rape to boot.

Ended up trying to find an explanation to all this mess so she turned to religion. While studying theology  she ended up in a relationship with an abusive drughead( LUL this is redundant dont you think?).Not only didnt she find answer to her questions but new one started to sprout out.Left the asshole and ended up in a small village working as a barmaid (where she found my dad, an adorable dork of a gentle giant of a lumberjack ( i love my dad, he is what men should strive to be, honest, hardworker, full of love for other and gentle with everyone, especially kids and animals)). when she finally finished her theology master degree she started to work as a pastoral  agent, teaching religions to kids. Lost her post because priests are dickwad narcissist male with power trips

tldr : Most men are dicks but the good ones are  amazing peoples deserving respect

edited to put a b to lumberjack :p"
71,"Everyone is still aware of it, they just aren't allowed to publicly acknowledge it anymore."
72,"“Better women” - I am quite sure you mean “better at adhering to sexist gender roles that are used to justify oppressing and subjugating people based on their genitals and conceding to keeping the ideals of military industry and colonization at the forefront of our society”. 

Your ‘I don’t see women as individuals’ is showing - misogynistic linguistics indicates misogynistic behavior."
73,"Hmmmm, I’d say at least a solid three."
74,"Theyre not wrong about this though.  Theyre actually pointing out a legitimate problem.  The notion of Progress has been so glorified, without any hard set definitions, that once something gets labelled as a Progressive cause, theres really no going back amongst that political faction.  They are not going to back down on this Trans thing, ever.  The majority of people who consider themselves Progressive are going to continue to support it, and most of those people will never have to deal with the ramifications.  For those of us who do support ""progressive"" things like basic human rights, but not this, we have lost.  I'm sorry to say, the game is over.  The Trans agenda has inserted itself so fully into the center of ""progressive"" politics that it is inextricable and unquestionable.  There is no more ""fixing this from within"", only a splintering of factions.  The fact that rightwing people also worry about this trans thing is a sign of that.  Youre both looking at the sames garbage fire, appalled for different reasons, but the fire still burns.  The best course is to just disengage from society until this whole thing collapses in in itself, and to try to rebuild something sane of the Left from the ashes, but for now trying to speak out in anything but GC or RW spaces is going to be futile and socially suicidal.  We are in this for the long haul.  Im not saying to team up with politics you hate, Im saying Im stepping back and watching society burn from a distance."

77,I weep for the alternate universe where prominent academics actually discuss this.  So much to unpack.
78,"Please do, that would be a sick paper."
79,Can you try to find the source for that paraphrase?
80,"""progressive"" causes lose ground all the time, even ones that are actually progressive.

In the past several decades, we've lost ground in union rights, abortion rights, voting rights for ethnic minorities, and immigration rights. The president is Donald J. Trump. ""Progressivism"" isn't some magic word that guarantees success.

And I think the rot can be excised, there's even historical precedent! This isn't the first time that a movement for oppression has latched onto a progressive cause. In the first wave of feminism, there were lots of anti-immigrant bigots who managed to shoehorn their agenda into the legitimate suffrage movement. In the 2000s, neocons tried to claim that the bloody invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan were ""feminist"" projects designed to liberate women. Both of these were accepted as ""progressive"" in their time, but are not viewed as such today. The trans movement is similar to these in that it claims to be an extension of a genuine progressive cause (LGB rights), while only using it as an excuse to oppress and endanger women. I have faith that people will eventually recognize the mistake that was made here, as they have in the past."
81,"I mean, you made [this lovely post](https://www.reddit.com/r/smuggies/comments/d50jjq/play_stupid_games_win_stupid_prizes/f0jsp6r/) calling women who date black men ""coal burners"", you post on /r/hateblackpeople, you're a genuinely racist piece of garbage.

This is not a hate subreddit, this is a progressive feminist subreddit. White supremacists don't belong here."
82,"The ""kill all men"" crap is a joke. We don't want to kill you, we just want you to leave us alone. But actual women will be killed by your proposed ban on abortion."
83,"I think a lot of them do, to be honest, just behind closed doors."
84,"It's at the end of his video called ""Men"""
85,"Oh im certainly not meaning to say that progressive movements dont lose ground.  In fact I believe that TRAs being given the reins of Progressive movements is going to fuck us all.  What I meant was that now given that this has become THE cause de jour of those with the power to dictate what ""Progress"" means, there is no going back.  They are in charge of the ""progressive movement"" now and I dont think they will ever allow trans shit to be taken off the table.  It would take a political coup of sorts, and would require new organizations - the trans will not be excised from the posts they were awarded.  Theyre willing to use Human Rights Courts to get their balls fondled, imagine what theyll do when threatened with political displacement.  We put a monkey in the drivers seat and we cant get it out now.  But forming ""new movements"" means a splintering of effort and loss of effectiveness.  I dont think there is a good answer to this problem.  I think the things that could be done to fix this would be unpalatable to everyone involved, and will never happen.  I don't think we'll ever see an alliance of ""right and left"" on this, which is what it would take to have the required political weight.  So we fracture.  Factions will form, each weaker than the previous.  I dont think this gets fixed short of dramatic change in planetary/societal conditions, ie a collapse of industrial civilization.  Until then, catgirls have the monopoly on ""our"" voices, be that women or progressives or minorities or pro-healthcare folks.  It doesn't look good.  They are not going to relinquish power, and lets be real, they will never be asked to."

Oh come the fuck on. People with more money and resources have an easier time jumping through hoops, and as it turns out, in a racist country, the victims of the racism have less money than the perpetrators. Stop being disingenuous.

>There was never a right to immigrate to the US.

91,"Progressivism is good, actually. Advances in rights for women, ethnic minorities, LGB people, the poor, and the disabled have all been great things. Trans Activism isn't bad because it's ""progress"", it's bad because it represents the undoing of progress on several of those fronts in order to secure an ever greater piece of the pie for straight upper class white men.

93,"I'm not pro trans, I'm anti-trans-agenda and pro feminism.

All of those things are awful, but none of them are in any way ""progress"". TRAs and people like you are two sides of the same coin. You both want to entrench gender essentialism, ""fix"" gender nonconforming people and homosexuals, and turn back the clock on feminism to the 1950s.

100,I'm browsing in bed with my screen brightness turned as low as it goes. I thought he posted something white with a bunch of fake clotty blood on it.
101,I could scream. How fucking dare he. I’ve been awake all night crying in pain because my prescription painkillers don’t stop the pain of my periods. Yesterday I was unable to walk from my living room to my bathroom without help. How fucking dare he fetishise periods thinking it’s about craving chocolate and eating what you want. Fuck off.
102,"Delusion, thy name is Wax My Balls."
103,Yaniv is cursed and every time I see him I wish to die
104,"I honestly don't understand this fake period BS that TiMs spout off about. Does this guy really claim to have menstrual cramps, or is he just being cheeky about craving chocolate?  Do they really put tampons up their asses?  How is this utter delusion not seen as mental illness?"
105,"Short luteal phase, he’ll never get pregnant at this rate 🤣"
106,His 'periods' are probably when his anus is bleeding from shoving so many tampons up there.
107,"He has A FUCKING SCHLONG, fake ass mofo"
108,Jesus fuck I hate it
109,"Dang, every time my cycle rears its head, I'm like nooooo, it can't be, we \*just\* did that! Only, it really has been a month. Yaniv literally just pretended to do that."
110,"I want you all to think for a moment about how Yaniv sat there, probably for some period of time before posting this, and thought to themselves ""ah! I know, post again about something vaguely period related, that will help validate my femininity in front of hundreds or thousands of internet strangers, this will make me so euphoric, how should I word it?"" and then carefully crafted these masterpieces"
111,"The problem is (I have unfortunately known someone like this) Yaniv feeds off reactions. Good, bad it doesn't matter. The best thing that could happen to this cunt is no-one reacts at all.

The person I knew loved it all. He killed a much loved cat in a town I was living in. people waited outside his trail to throw shit at him and it was like it was his Oscar moment. He'd never had so much focus on him. These people are unhinged."
112,"Alrighty, first off i thought that was a dried up clod of neovag blood until i realized it was cake for the “OMG QUIRKY GIRL CRAVINGS 😘😘🥰🥰😍😍😍😋😚😚” tweet"
113,I'm now wondering if JV maybe only became trans as an excuse to eat cake.
114,"wait..he is pretending to have periods? god, i hated my period.  I had so many ruined clothes and cramps that were so bad I had to go to the ER for pain meds! Then I had a Novasure ablation and after about 6 months all the cramping and stuff stopped.  I even had PMDD until I was 50.  WTF is wrong with this weirdo?"
115,Nice to know that the government did nothing with preventing this pedophile getting closer to children.
116,Yikes. Taking laxatives at that pace might fuck up his system completely.
117,"AGPs will create some context in every conversation about themselves where they refer to themselves as a 'girl' which is something that adult women rarely ever do.  I don't think I have known one woman who is at least 20 years old who regularly refers to themselves as a 'girl'.  In fact, the only people I know who call adult women girls are men.   Yaniv also seems to get his period every other week.  I don't think he understands that most adult women without an underlying medical condition have cycles that last anywhere from 3-5 weeks.  He hasn't even thought this up in his larp. Total bro logic."
118,"I mean, it makes sense! We're constantly told that trans women are twice as oppressed as regular women, so it only makes sense that they have periods twice as often!"
119,It is beyond me why a male adult needs to play pretend to have a period.... what in the actual fuck
120,I don’t crave anything when i’m on my period... just paracetamol
121," women don't post updates that basically say ""I'm on my period now""

But if they did men would scream and tantrum until they stopped"
122,Why does he act like he gets periods? What the fuck?

124,Where does the blood come out when he has his period?

129,That cake looked like he just pulled it out of his urethra
130,"Question: why are we supposed to care anout this? They are making a fool out of themselves, that's an obviously disgusting fetish. But it isnt problematic. The problem is when they push women away from their own experiences, but if we call them out on their lifestyle BS they will have a defence compared to calling them out on invading privacy.

To be fair without this sub i wouldve never understood the mindset of how they think or why they act in such a weird and loud way, but they'll pretend that it's them being loud to oppose some form of non-existent oppression."

147,"> I honestly don't understand this fake period BS that TiMs spout off about. 

Have you ever seen the TV show ""Dexter?""

Honestly, it's a fairly accurate representation of how psychopaths think. As Dexter goes about his life, he's always asking himself *""how would a normal person react in this situation?""* and Dexter is constantly attempting to mimic human emotion, when the truth is that he's just a blank automaton. Being a psychopath is very much like being a robot. Mark Zuckerberg is an obvious example, he's just a complete robot. *""The Social Network""* did a wonderful job of capturing that.

Now, understanding all of that, *what if you were a psychopath who was attempting to pass as a woman?* You would do all the things that you've seen women do. And that's what a lot of these TiMs are mimicking; they're acting out the things that they've seen their sisters do, or their mothers do. It's the reason they have this weird disconnect from human morality. No sane woman would throw a pool party with topless twelve year olds, but a male psychopath would."
148,I've always wondered where they put the tampon 🤷‍♀️
149,"Did you see the interview with Blaire White? He loved the attention so much, it was disgusting."
150,Couldn't agree more.
151,"Wait what (I'm new to this), he takes *laxatives* and pretends it's his period?"
152,"Nope. He's just batshit and always has been. Someone from KF found a former neighbor of Yaniv's from when Yaniv was in his very early twenties. Yaniv got fired from his job at the pool's condo when he tried contacting a thirteen year old on Facebook. Yaniv and his parents harrassed their neighbors all the time.

I know Oger wanted to make Yaniv the ""postergirl"" for TRA's, but Yaniv proved to be bad optics really fast. Embarrassingly so. He had too big of a digital footprint and he just wouldn't and **couldn't** STFU."
153,"He's Jewish, probably not that well liked in those communities even if he would hold their views.

Honestly, I just think he's an insane narcissist."
154,"He's openly racist, so he's not doing a great job at being undercover. 

I agree that he's a right wing accelerationist, though."
155,It doesn't it's fake
156,They can't get them. Men who say they have periods are lying.

160,Same dude.
161,That just means he's double the woman!
162,"A lot of doctors will actually argue that it's *healthier* long term to skip periods with birth control. Every period the lining is shed and regrown and *any* biology mechanism that involves injury or growing new tissue ups the life long risk for cancer. Because every new cell formed in the body has the possibly of malfunctioning, going rogue and multiplying rapidly. Which is the definition of a cancerous cell.

Women in the past were pregnant much more often during their lifetime, and many doctors think the modern woman may be at higher risk for ovarian cancer due to hundreds of more periods during their reproductive years. So many of them *recommend* skipping periods if your birth control allows it.

Hormonal birth control has it own issues for a lot of women, but if you're already using it successfully without terrible side effects, don't listen to the scare tactics telling you to take the sugar week and get your period if you don't get any peace of mind out of it. *A lot* of researchers think it lowers your lifetime risk for ovarian cancer."
163,"I'm the same. I enjoy my periods even when they're painful because it connects me to my body and... without wanting to sounds to newagey, it connects me to nature. I also feel closer to women, past present and future. There's something really beautiful about periods. I could never relate to the women that said they hated them, or wish they didn't have any. I know that my best friend also feels the same as me, so we're not alone!"
164,What's up with your username?

This party might change that (I hope not for the young girls) but we can't arrest people for thought crimes. As much as I hate JY he hasn't acted on his impulses yet. It sucks we can't lock him up as a preventative measure but it also sets a dangerous prescident
177,Even better he tried to force women to wax his penis snd tried to sue the places that refused. He lost the case.

179,Well those mem said enough that they were better than women at being women so of course it means they have AT LEAST twice the periods. I've heard some of them have constant periods they are the most desirable of trans women. Except for the 50yr old men identifying as 12yr old girls who still haven't got their periods UwU.

181,"I have been skipping mine for over 4 years, however my new Gyno is saying it’s thinned out my uterine lining too much. Not sure if that even matters, but she wanted to take a break. I hate getting my period!!!"
182,"Especially since the ""period"" you get on the placebo week isn't even a real menstrual period, and wasn't included for medical reasons. It wasn't just a side effect that they didn't' bother to fix either, it was a deliberate addition. A deliberate addition of medically unnecessary pain and bleeding. It was either included as an attempt to avoid freaking out Catholics (who would not appreciate the lifting of ""Eve's curse""), or because the people who invented it thought that women wouldn't be able to wrap their tiny little lady brains around the idea of something that temporarily makes you infertile also temporarily stopping your period, depending on what source you believe."

* 78.4% of 584 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual acknowledged at least one lifetime incidence of autogynephilic arousal, compared to just 20% of 589 MtF subjects classified as homosexual.

* In four of the five studies (Lawrence (2005) excluded) reporting MtF subjects' history of transvestic fetishism, 73% of 382 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual reported at least one lifetime episode of transvestic fetishism, compared to just 20% of 577 MtF subjects classified as homosexual.

* In Lawrence's (2005) study of of 232 MtF transsexuals patients who underwent SRS, 90% of 202 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual reported at least one lifetime episode of autogynephilic arousal, with median and modal frequencies of hundreds of episodes or more. Of the 12 MtF subjects classified as homosexual, only 3 (25%) reported at least on episode one lifetime episode of autogynephilic arousal, and ""the median and modal number of episodes homosexual participants reported were both never.""

* In Nuttbrock's et al. (2011) study, 40% of the exclusively homosexual MtF group began HRT during adolescence, compared to just 1% of the heterosexual MtF group and 14% of the bisexual MtF group. Thus validating Blanchard's observation that homosexual MtF transsexuals present for clinical assessment at a significantly younger age than non-homosexual MtF transsexuals. Furthermore, 82% of exclusively gynephilic MtF subjects reported a history of transvestic fetishism, compared to just 14% of MtF subjects who had started HRT during adolescence."

Another excuse blown out of proportion to discriminate against a group for ""degeneracy""."
245,"Yeah, it's almost like when you suppress subconscious desires, they find a lot of perverse ways to manifest. I think a lot of people are happier being the girl now, rather than fetishizing it anymore, but who cares about outcomes am I right?"

254,A trans person who hasn’t come out yet or hasn’t figured out that they’re trans is called an egg. The process of “discovering” that they’re trans is called hatching.
255,"They call trans people that aren’t “out” yet eggs, because an egg hatches into a “chick.” 🙄"

>>Yeah, EVERY SINGLE sexual fantasy, ever (well, 99.9% of them anyway) I was a girl. There would be fetish stuff involved too, but but the common thread is that I was always female gendered."

260,What is the Trans mafia?
261,"They're not. Just like the people on reddit are not 100% representative of any community. It does seem to be a very small group of people with overlapping interests though, which probably explains some of the behaviours around anime/catgirls/headpats/etc.

Then you're taking an even smaller slice when you look at one particular sub. 

I'm all for conflicting opinions when they're presented respectfully, but this is cherry-picking at its finest. Then again with the title of this sub I shouldn't be surprised."
262,"Well, survey was posted on r/MtF sub. One would assume the sub's demographics are primarily transwomen and transfemme individuals."
263,"If it starts as a fetish, it's a fetish. My crossdressing progressed from fetishistic to feelings of comfort and relaxation. This doesn't mean that it's not pariphilic anymore. Those feelings of comfort and relaxation are manifestations of low-level sexual arousal, and my sexual fantasies still exclusively center around my transvestism.

>The low level, long lasting ""erotic buzz""... may be a good example of what Docter (1988) was referring to when he observed that ""transvestism and transsexualism are, in part, mood altering behavioral strategies. They generate pleasurable excitement and a sense of well-being.""

281,"That's not exactly what it is; it's not about people changing sex, it's about people becoming aware of/accepting that they are transgender, as in, that their gender identity does not correspond to their assigned gender at birth. It's just a cute way of saying it. Coming out of the egg, it's a bit like coming out of the closet except it's for gender identity and not sexuality. Nothing disrespectful about it... or if you think it is I'd like to understand why.

285,"There really is no difference between the two. Transwomen who aren't exclusively androphilic (attracted to men), which includes asexual transwomen, are really no different than transvestites and sissy fetishists. In each case, their cross-gender identity and expression is rooted in and motivated by their AGP."
286,"Gender critical TiMs like fionne orlander don't convince me precisely because they employ these kinds of tactics.  On one hand they get endless headpats for stating the obvious- that a trans  woman must be male to identify as such but then they will betray their inner biases which dictate that being gay and liking stereotypically feminine shit means that they're more analogous to women (because what is there to womanhood but playing up some sexist ingenue trope). Graphics they share like [this one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EGTK4m0VAAAXY7c?format=jpg&name=large) are annoying as hell because not only are the examples totally cherry picked but the entire thing is misleading.

I also consider ladybrains as a whole to be  pretty suspicious, im not a woman stuck in a man body, im a gay male that hate being a man."
290,">Trans gay males are still men, and were socialized as males their entire lives. 

...Except for when you're not because you transitioned very early in life and were socialized as female after that point.

>Their views of women rarely differ from that of straight men.

Views on women aren't a marker for who's female. By that logic, right-wing/anti-feminist non-trans women aren't women.

>The only difference is that they are not sexually attracted to women.

...And not fetishistic in their feelings toward men. And not fetishistic toward women. Which means that if transsexuality is not biologically real, ""homosexual TiMs"" would have entirely different reasons for transitioning.

>But they still buy into the submissive ladybrains stereotype just as wholeheartedly as straight men, and are just as likely to fetishize submissiveness as any other man.

...Except when they don't. In which case...?"
291,"First, You are not ""assigned a gender at birth."" You are born with sexual characteristics which determine your sex.  Changing your gender expression wouldn't require surgery or HRT. If you are doing that you are trying to change your *sex* [even though humans can't actually do that, most transpeople falsely believe that they can change sex.].

Birds are hatched, implying the opposite sex is equivalent to unintelligent animals is very disrespectful, do you really need that explained to you in such detail? If you are saying you're getting ""hatched into a woman"" it's very offensive and misogynistic language  to many women, not to  transpeople."

I said there's a difference between a transexual person who finds the idea of transforming or being another gender attractive as a result from being transexual in the first place and deeply desiring that, and people who fetishise transexuality and desire it out of a kink. They're the exact opposite thing. I think there is a huge difference. Also, this sub loves to hate and flame transexual people despite the fact that even if I were wrong, a huge percentage of transexual people don't have or had the fetish."

299,"Ah yes, you got us, we are all very misogynistic and when we talk about eggs we definitely just mean that women are as dumb as birds. That's 100% what's going on here, even though we actually use the hatching analogy for every gender including trans men and non-binary people, and not just trans women, but yeah! Totally. We love to insult ourselves.

Seriously, are you really that daft? Jesus Christ. And you people say we're the ones getting offended for no reason. 

And about your first point, it's missing mine entirely, and not worth responding to; you went on this rant about how changing sex and gender aren't the same thing even though I never implied that they were. All I said is that the ""egg"" analogy applies to gender identity and not to sex change.

Also, you know it's not only birds who lay eggs right? Not that it matters cause either way it's just an analogy but the mental gymnastics you did to be offended by it impress me."
300,"That analogy with birds is a bit of a stretch. And, well, sex is complicated. There are things scientifically recognized as primary sexual characteristics which can naturally change throughout a person's lifetime or are even expected to. It's also possible to be born with these primary sexual characteristics mismatched. There's even research suggesting that trans people are neurologically intersex. I think the egg idea is a bit weird, but I don't believe that it reflects anyone's views of non-trans people at all."
301,"You skim over any of the studies in the stickied comment? Read our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/itsafetish/wiki/index/faq) where we link to numerous credible sources backing our sub's position? Basic familiarity with Blanchard's transexual typology is expected here. Either familiarize yourself with it and debate me then, or get lost."
302,"So you mean the percent of loud agp and loud HsTs is the same? Everywhere i look i see agp yelling murder because they are not accepted , that lesbians shoud accept theirs penises and  that they are valid women even tho it is all a fetish thing,  in comparison i find us HSTS way quieter. And no im here because Perverts are sickening, and i want them to ge the fuck away."
303,"Oh, FFS, I was just making the point that your weird  dehumanising language comes across in that way whether you meant it or not. If you had just said it wasn't meant that way it would have been fine but instead you have to come in here and make stupid defenses of it. I really don't know why you come into our sub and expect us to swallow all your bullshit trans ideology and lame excuses for your misogyny anyway."
304,I have seen trans people make these sort of claims before but I don't think it's proven by properly peer reviewed science.
305,"You seem to be completely unable to accept nuanced differences or even anything that's not really primitive absolutes. Unfortunately, psychology is nigh incomprehensibly complex and absolutes apply to almost nothing. I know Blanchard's typology - it's also incredibly outdated and has ridiculously biased evidence picking. He even just waves away information that doesn't support his proposed conclusion as it being outliers or just false. What's more dishonest than utilising evidence in order to prove a conclusion, rather than deriving a conclusion from evidence? It's been used to justify ideologies through biased results for many years, usually by bigots that want to validate their sense of superiority. ie Morton's skulls.

If you want to debate in good faith, you shouldn't be advocating for only one side of an argument like the sub does. Or shutting out anyone that doesn't circlejerk and then pretend to be a fair discussion sub... guess I'll get lost. Cheers."
306,">So you mean the percent of loud agp and loud HsTs is the same?

Yes. IME HSTS get even more visibility.  Within trans activism, they collaborate, too: Laverne Cox raised money for an imprisoned child killer rapist. Calpernia Addams and Lynn Conway. Among many examples. outside of trans activism,[they still flip out over pronouns, want children transed, claim they're the only ""true women"", can be awful to women and gay men.](https://i.imgur.com/U25SAN1.png) (that includes those who associate themselves with GC feminists)."
307,"I've met a lot of lesbians who are open to dating trans women. Maybe it's just a younger generation thing, can't say for sure. Some are only open to post-op trans women but others are open to both even if they aren't open to cisgender men."
308,You're reaching.
309,"I can't imagine there are too many people on Reddit who are qualified to decide if a peer-reviewed study is valid or not and who also care what a small percentage of the population does with their bodies, so I think we just have to trust scientists when so many of them start saying the same thing. Unless maybe there are just as many or more saying something different. The APA and WHO both seem to have accepted that it's at least not a part of someone's sexuality and they're generally pretty trustworthy. I don't agree with everything they claim, but I do assume they know better than I do."

I don’t mean this to be rude, but you are very terrible at picking up context clues and reading the signs. We never have pretended to be a fair discussion sub. It’s in our rules, it’s in our description, and it’s in our faq. We clearly are not a debate subreddit. We are very clearly a community to discuss a problem from a specific framework and feminist ideology. I don’t understand how anyone gets the impression we are a space for everyone and anyone. We aren’t. That’s okay. We are a space *for* gender critical radical feminists and allies. We make some exceptions for those who want to discuss in good faith. We use Blanchard’s typology to discuss. I don’t understand how we can make any of that clearer??


If anything, you should feel grateful that a mod even entertained your bad faith posting in the first place. You don’t respect the community enough to follow the rules or understand the space you are in before subjugating people to your perspective. lol"

Pronouns shit go against my own belief of using the pronouns you see ( calling somebody that look like a man he, woman she ) unless you are aware of his/her trans status and in that case you should use the pronouns that adhere to your own beliefs, transing at all should be a real last resort if other therapy dont work, we are obviously not real women , just fascimile at the best, and i dislike being awful to anyone, women and gay men(considering i am a gay man to boot)  can be amazing peoples or pieces of trash like anyone else."
312,"These women are likely bi or pan if they are attracted to pre-op penis in any way, shape, or form. 

This is the problem we as lesbians are currently facing. Lesbians cannot find a penis attractive, that’s *why* we’re lesbians. Otherwise we’d likely be open to dating men or pre-op transwomen. We’d also be *bisexual* for it. 

The girls claiming “I’m a lesbian and *I* like girl dick, so all you other lesbians are being close minded and transphobic” are a huge part of the problem right now. I as a lesbian *cannot* force myself to like penises and their functions. They psychically turn me off. I don’t even enjoy penetration. Yet I’ve been told that I’m transphobic and close minded for not being open to girl penis. If a straight male said this to me, it’d be considered homophobic. No one would *ever* demand a gay man accept their vagina. Genitalia is an important part of sexuality and for some is *the* most important part. Transbians have no right to demand penis acceptance from an established group of women who hate penis. Most of the transbians I’ve encountered have no desire for bottom surgery and still like their penis. But they rarely fuck each other — which really tells you all you need to know. 

Right now a lot of bisexuals and straight women are appropriating lesbian culture and identity because it’s somehow “cooler” or “easier” to just cut and dry state they’re a lesbian than explain the intricacies of their own sexuality. I understand why they might, but this in turn damages “actual” lesbians who are not afforded the same leniencies in terms of our rigid sexualities. If you’re a lesbian who likes penis, you’re not a lesbian haha. And people get really angry when you gatekeep their identity (even though they do not fit the “requirements” for the identity they’ve chosen). They then damage the perception of lesbians because of attitudes like “well she *was* a lesbian and now she’s dating Rob, so I guess they all secretly want the D”. We don’t. 


Sorry for the novel and that’s not at all directly at you, it’s just extremely frustrating to be a cis lesbian in this day and age. It was easier a decade ago — which is mind blowing. As gay men and trans folk progress, lesbian identity had become watered down and appropriated by men with fetishes, entitled/upset transwomen, and bisexuals who don’t realize the damage they’re doing by claiming to be a lesbian while harboring attraction towards dick."
313,">Save

You are moving the goal posts. The claim was that primary sex characteristics naturally change and trans people are ""neurologically intersex."" I don't think the WHO and APA are saying anything of the sort. Sure a penis or a vulva will change with puberty but they don't naturally change from one to the other! That's absurd."
314,"The person I was talking to chose to start an argument but also told me off for not debating them from their own point of view. Also, regardless of whether you view the typology as true or not or your personal opinion on AGP, discussion on a subject that disallows the objective analysis of research and science from more than just biased handpicks... well, it's not discussion. So they shouldn't be inviting me to debate ""after becoming familiar"" with the typology the sub pushes its views but not with anything against it. If your big issue with me is that I'm expecting a ""fair debate"", then you should know that it only is because they implied it in the first place. If you don't want to debate fairly, don't pretend to be open to an idea other than your own.

Blanchard's typology is the most scientifically accurate theory on transsexualism in natal males. [His theory was built upon a solid foundation of scientific, empirical, and historical research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E4gJm-2ar-MEqL4K8S9uykhqhRbb2-Q6/view). Look at the research and judge for yourself instead of going by what you've read or heard secondhand from trans activists. I'm more than familiar with all the criticisms of AGP from Serano, Moser, Veale, Contrapoints, etc. It has never been scientifically debunked."
317,They so wanted to vote yes on this but Yaniv is such a degenerate that they had no choice but to go this way.
318,"That's somewhat of a loss. Imagine months being in a lawsuit, imagine losing income for months, one of them even closed shop; and the pay for the improper lawsuit is only about $2000. I would say that doesn't even cover the stress of months in a lawsuit under the public eye.

I don't know about the legislature, but hopefully they have the option for a counter suit. Although even then, Yaniv might not actually have any money to payback the damage he caused. So they might still be stuck on a loss."

320,"These people are so insane. They can't even answer questions about what kind of genitals they have. They refuse to even acknowledge the concept of sexual dimophism. Just read this crap:

> This portion of my decision addresses Ms. Yaniv’s complaints against Blue Heaven Beauty Lounge and Ms. Benipal, Ms. DaSilva, Ms. Tran, Ms. Dulay, and Merle Norman. In each of these cases, the Respondents advertised the service of “brazilian waxing”, and it was this service which Ms. Yaniv attempted to book. These cases raise two common issues at the outset: (1) what service was Ms. Yaniv requesting, and (2) does this service constitute a brazilian wax, such that it is one the Respondents were customarily providing to the public.  In this section, I address each of these issues in turn, and then go on to apply my findings to each individual complaint.    
>  
>9 A.The service Ms. Yaniv was requesting Ms. Yaniv does not dispute that she was requesting that these Respondents wax her genitals. In this unique context, her genitals were therefore relevant to her complaints – specifically to the question of whether the Respondents customarily provided the type of genital waxing that she was requesting. Throughout the hearing, however, Ms. Yaniv refused to answer questions about her genitals and argued that such questions were inappropriate. Given her representation to various Respondents that she had “male parts”, has not “gone through surgery”, and “was born a man now I’m a woman”, the hearings initially proceeded on the understanding that she has a penis and scrotum, and that she was therefore requesting waxing of the scrotum. However, under cross examination she was evasive on the issue, referring to “whatever is down there”. In the Blue Heaven hearing on July 4, she insinuated that she may be intersex but refused to say whether she was. Asked to explain what she meant when she told Ms. Benipal she had “male parts”, she testified simply “I mean male parts”.  On July 17, in the hearing against Ms. DaSilva, Ms. Yaniv testified that she had “male genitals”. Moments later, she testified, for the first time, that she is intersex. She said again that she had “male parts” and then added that she had “other stuff”, though she initially refused to say whether that included a vulva. She denied, for the first time, that she had asked Ms. DaSilva to wax a scrotum. Ms. Yaniv refused to answer questions put to her by Ms. DaSilva’s counsel, and so I intervened:   
>  
>Tribunal:   Ms. Yaniv, it’s relevant to this complaint. ... The question is, what were you asking Ms. DaSilva to wax?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  I was asking for a female genital waxing wax .... A brazilian wax.   
>  
>Tribunal:  ... Forget brazilian, brozilian, male, female, whatever – what body part were you asking her to ask?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  The genitals, the genital region.   
>  
>Tribunal:  Their defence hinges on a defence that they, that she, is not comfortable waxing a scrotum. So are you talking about a scrotum, or are you talking about a vulva, or are you talking about both?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  The second one.   
>  
>Tribunal:  Vulva?   
>  
>Ms. Yaniv:  Yes.   
>  
>Tribunal:  ... You’re saying you were asking her to wax a vulva? Ms. Yaniv:   
>  
> Yes. ... I’m not gonna say whether I have the whole thing. I’ll say it exists.  
>  
> At this point, Mr. Cameron asked Ms. Yaniv to submit to an independent medical examination to verify her genitals. I refused to make such an order, on the basis that it was unduly intrusive and disproportionate to the issues at stake.  I am satisfied, based on Ms. Yaniv’s representations to the Respondents that she has “male parts”, “used to be a boy”, and has not “gone through surgery yet”, as well as her evidence in these hearings that she has “male parts”, that Ms. Yaniv was seeking to have hair removed from a scrotum. Whether or not she may also have a vulva is not ultimately determinative of any issue in this complaint and so I do not need to engage further with that question"

331,"LOL look at where the judge talks about Yaniv's motives for filing the complaints:

> However, I find that Ms. Yaniv’s predominant motive in filing her waxing complaints is not to prevent or remedy alleged discrimination, but to target small businesses for personal financial gain. In many of these complaints, she is also **motivated to punish racialized and immigrant women based on her perception that certain ethnic groups, namely South Asian and Asian communities, are “taking over”** and advancing an agenda hostile to the interests of LGBTQ+ people. These motives are not consistent with the Code’s purposes, and in particular its purpose of promoting a climate of understanding and mutual respect, where all are equal in dignity and rights: s.

I cant sue my neighbor because I asked him to give me 100€ and he refused can I? They will tell me to fuck off, but he successfully did, meaning they actually considered the possibility that he might have a point there. The system is deeply broken. They wasted these women's money and time and gave them sleepless nights and headaches. This isnt a win and this should never ever happen again."

While I found her to be evasive on this issue, Ms. Yaniv acknowledged that she was not menstruating and would not have required Ms. Benipal to work around a tampon.

In my view, the most likely scenario is that Ms. Yaniv was trying to make Ms. Benipal feel uncomfortable or awkward for her own amusement or as a form of revenge. This is consistent with Ms. Yaniv’s behaviour in relation to all of the Respondents. ""

And: "" However, I will add that Ms. Yaniv has also not persuaded me that Ms. DaSilva even knew that Ms. Yaniv had a scrotum when she cancelled the appointment, or that Ms. Yaniv’s gender identity otherwise played any role in Ms. DaSilva’s decision to deny service. Rather, I find that the only reason that Ms. DaSilva cancelled the appointment was because she found Ms. Yaniv’s behaviour troubling and deceptive – which it was. ""

What if he was targeting white women who don’t belong to religious organizations? What if he was offering to donate any money awarded him to charity? Would the court still have ruled this way?

I think even in the trans community that’s been discussed to the point of death.

421,"It's been a process of social transition actually, when I first came out and cut my hair I still didnt pass well no matter what I wore, but as I started socially transitioning (over the course of around a year now) I've started passing better, and my voice doesnt give me away. I've literally been asked (by a cis guy) ""have you had your first blowjob yet?"" He thought I had a dick lmao"
422,"It's not that I dont want to be a woman, in fact if I could I'd stay as a woman, itd make my life a hell of a lot easier. But I cant do that, you may not believe that but I do and you dont have to refer to me as male, I dont care"

424,"You're delusional.

432,"What the fuck?!  The last thing any of us want in our bathrooms is men’s dicks, especially when they want to wag them in our faces.  They are so disgusting.  We bring our babies into those restrooms.  But these perverts would see that as a bonus 🤢🤮"
433,The urge to downvote this based on pure anger and revulsion was strong.
434,This is so fucking gross. Not only invading women's spaces but now wanting to just downright violate them with their sex obsession. Idk how they expect people to see them as women when they just act like the type of men women in general hate.
435,"For what ? Women go to bathrooms to pee, not for doing porn. 

This dude is living in la la porn-land.

But the men's room doesn't *validate* them."
440,Remember these are the same people telling Lesbians that Lesbians are NOT attracted to Genitals but to the 'apperance of femininity' . Yet glory holes literally glorify one part of the body... The fucking genitals. These people. Where they are all dropped on their heads as children?
441,Why is EVERYTHING about SEX?

450,"I don't understand glory holes at all.  I mean I understand how they work.  Please dear Jebus I don't want details.  But sticking your most delicate part in a blind hole where you don't know what is on the other side just doesn't compute to me.  Someone could be over there with a knife, needles, scissors, razorblades or whatever.  I know a large present of men will stick their penises in anything but come on."
451,This made me sick
452,Uh...no tf they don’t don’t.

London has closed a lot of its public toilets as they can't afford to keep regular security there to prevent dudes scarfing hogs."

487,Or give them that self righteous thrill.
488,"They let their fetish take over every aspect of their life, what do you expect?"
489,Men are very shallow.
490,Look at the sub title. Because its a fetish.
491,I think it means he’s a straight man who wants to just lie there and have the woman do all the work. I’ve seen straight TIMs use this language before.
492,"I guess he is a bisexual bottom if he wants to be topped by transbians and women. And i guess it's not enough creep and fetishist points, gay dudes don't want to roleplay with him as teenage girls having pajama parties."
493,"You are not alone. Gay dude here. I have never ever ever seen the remote attraction to this type of sex. Christ if you are that desperate have a wank.

It repels me as well. As do bathhouses it is all just I dunno. Self indulgent. I have self respect......"
494,"I seem to remember there being an anti rape thingy that women could insert inside themselves that had internally facing and inwards pointing barbs on the inside. The idea being if the poor women was ever raped then the perp would get his tackle ripped to pieces.

Stick those on the wall."

496,"It's weird that when people make this argument, they assume that only straight white men that hate women would make the bathroom argument."
497,:(
498,Well said.
499,">all the men that want to use women’s bathrooms are sex obsessed perverts

This seems like a very reasonable statement and shouldn't be the least bit controversial."
500,"Why would they be? It's not like we have our own bathrooms or anything.

Obligatory /s for those who need it."
501,Well you read false things because there has already been a lot of assaults by tims or standard men using tims laws where the self ids policies have been implemented. And stats back it up. Gender inclusive/neutral policies only advantage rapists and creeps.
502,"If someone did assault a woman in a bathroom, they would say they’re “not a real trans” because a real trans woman would never do that"
503,what's gay about wanting a glory hole in a women's bathroom? bruh
504,"I don't want gay men in women's spaces either, but why do you think they're gay?  Let me tell you: they're definitely *not* all gay."
505,Wait what? I've been in probably 200 or so different public restrooms and never seen anything like that. London sounds like a crazy place.
506,"Nah, she had the right idea. Slice, then flush 🍆🚽👋"
507,Touché.
508,"I have a pet theory about this. I am a gay male. I have noticed that in the gay world 'extreme' sex is quite 'normalised'.

My theory is that men are like dogs. Will literally fuck anything. Women act as 'calmers' in straight relationships. They temper the more wild and crazy aspects of male sexuality.

Men are dogs. Gay men are dogs with no leash. And  I include trans people in this. Trans 'women' mostly seem to go with other trans 'women' which basically means its two gay men. So the 'extreme' aspect comes into play again. There is a distinct lack of feminine energies involved. Couple this with how porn tends towards making people go slowly more and more extreme in order to hit the same 'high'. And well. It can be a recipe for disaster."
509,"Also true. 

But still. It seems like they are all obsessed with weird and Cringy sex. Like degeneracy."
510,"I mean, you're not wrong."
511,"The idea of those sounds really dangerous to me 
Wouldn't it increase the risk of the attacker killing the victim?"
512,"I think the idea was that it would get stuck around the penis and be painful and nearly impossible to remove alone (without serious injury) so the rapist would have to go to a doctor to have it removed, busting himself in the process."
513,Put a zip tie on it
514,"Ah yea those only hurt the man's penis when he tries to take it off. They have to see a doctor to have them removed.

But they are illegal anyway, such a shame because it'd probably help a lot with stranger and date rapes."
515,"That’s right, didn’t they have these in some African countries? They had to be removed surgically which meant more men could be caught for attempted rape or sexual assault. Don’t know why they’re not mainstream, probably because blah blah something human rights ..."
516,r/thisneverhappens
517,"Not if, when."
518,But then they are assuming someone's gender!
519,This is straight facts right here
520,">Trans 'women' mostly seem to go with other trans 'women' which basically means its two gay men.

Most TIMs don't go after other TIMs; they want \[cis\] women/lesbians (usually because dicks/girldicks make them DySpHOrIc). After all, why else do they constantly complain about the ""cotton ceiling"" if they could just date their ""fellow lesbians (transbians)"", right?"
521,the victim can run away while the attacker will clutch the remains of his penis
522,"Many women have this weird notion that fighting back will get them killed. I hear this often when I bring up carrying mace in response to women’s concerns regarding personal safety. 

Mace dehabilitates a person. You can’t even tie your shoes if you get maced, yet alone focus your attention to your victim to kill them. 

And that’s just mace. This spiked dick clamp sounds like unimaginable torture, beyond anything you’d see in medieval times. Nobody can fight through that unfathomable pain."
523,"I have no idea if they are a good idea or not. As you say might well make the situation worse. I honestly have no clue really.... But  as a man. And without wanting to ponder to deeply on the topic. I think if it were me. I might well be more worried about downstairs than anything else.

I would I think be to worried about trying to ensure that whatevers left behind is saved and get myself to a hospital toot sweet. But I am not one to try to put myself into the mindset of a rapist. So honestly no clue. Dont really want one either......"
524,"Jesus, all those stories are just awful"
525,"r/thisneverhappens

Search “bathroom”"
526,Might be more accurate to say most TIMs *settle* for other TIMs.
527,It took 4 big burly rugby playing men to hold me back from kicking the fuck out of a guy who followed me into a bathroom and tried to rape me. I'm very proud of my 17 year old self and if it ever happened again I would fight the fucker tooth and nail. This shit is about power to them and I'll be damned if I give them an ounce of it.

I wish every time some asshole tried to rape a women he'd take a chestful of lead."
530,"Or, ya know, a legally purchased and carried firearm."
531,"Eh, I had to go through a CS gas chamber which is regarded as worse and it wasn't *debilitating* it just sucked and burned pretty bad. I could definitely run after someone though. For how long? I dunno, a little while probably but it didn't make me roll on the floor dying like everyone thinks will happen. I've honestly had hot sauces that burned more and made me drool and snot way worse."
532,"I'm a teeny tiny woman, and I've made men back off without using anything. Sometimes defending yourself will get you killed, but actually deffending yourself before tha attack happens CAN save your life. A man will back off if he thinks you are no longer an easy target and you'll deffend yourself."
533,Jesus Christ...
534,"I went down a deep rabbit hole, now there’s terms like cissexist too?"

539,"Yeees!

And if anyone else wears leggings and t shirts more than you wanna admit there is an amazing hip holster. Just make sure you're comfortable carrying and know what you are doing and the risks involved or don't carry imo. Falling is a thing and whatnot.

That said, I was so glad to have it yesterday. It wasn't rape or anything like that but it was a punter looking for a woman is a prostitute because before my company bought the building the small storage shed was used for that. Didn't even walk 100ft from the building. But we all know how dangerous men can be, especially when confronted.

Not bad ass like being a young woman and physically fighting off a piece of shit rapist. I'm so happy you weren't hurt or assaulted."
540,"I mean, yeah, I agree. Bringing this up is a conversation ender though because so many women are 100% adverse towards anything to do with guns."
541,"I’ve done CS Gas and OC spray. The spray is far worse. But the whole point of the course is to prove that you can, in fact, perform after being sprayed. It hurts but you’re actually really functional."

Even at older ages, even after going to the bathroom with friends of the opposite sex, even after seeing both parents naked when changing. What the fuck is going on that this toddler is talking up a storm about mommy’s dick???"
550,"Well, a penis and vagina brought that kid into the world.  So triggering for both parents, yet they did it anyway."
551,"Oh god, the bullying in that kids future is gonna be fuckin BRUTAL"
552,"“It’s inaccurate”

Uh how? It’s totally accurate. According to trans ideology, gender has nothing to do with genitals, so why would it matter?"
553,"What have you decided to tell the child that a penis is called? Let's say for argument's sake that it's ""pee-pee"" but substitute any other term you like.

Your eternal beloved's ""feminine penis"" is therefore a ""lady pee-pee."" Let the child announce to the world that mommy has a lady's pee-pee. And we'll see how that one goes down"

Please, for the love of God, phone Social Services.  Do it now.  Immediately.  Call them and tell them that you and your partner are both grossly, profoundly mentally unwell and incapable of safely parenting a child at this point in time.  Ask them to come round to your home, immediately, and take your child to a safe place, where he or she will no longer be the victim of sexualized mental abuse.  Do it right now."

565,Oh god.
566,"Has anyone on the planet ever, in the history of the world, talked about their genitals in terms of size “big” using porn language “clit” to a toddler and NOT been a threat to that toddler?

Like, we’re very open about sex and bodies in our house. Our daughter saw her dad naked from day 1 (we only had 1 bathroom and when you gotta go....).  She NEVER asked him what his penis is until when she was about 4 ish and saw her little cousin naked and saw he had one too, obviously, being a sane person we simply told her that boys have a penis.  As she got older we got her a book about bodies that explains anatomy and sex and periods in child friendly terms (she hides it under her bed but approaches me occasionally to ask for clarification).

This man should tell his child the truth. He’s a male and so he has a penis. If his dysphoria isn’t bad enough that he’s able to keep and use his penis to impregnate his wife surely he can tell his child what a penis is and what it’s used for?

Ideally the child would be living with his boomer grandparents as his parents have an issue with appropriate boundaries and behaviours in front of their toddler."

Do they think their child wants to know what they have? Or is it an issue of no boundaries where there should be quite a few important ones?"

Most kids will just ask ""what's that"", get a straight answer, and then get on with their day, but I can imagine that if these parents have been very cagey and refused to answer, then it's understandable that the kid wouldn't be satisfied and keep pushing it."
641,"Eh, my daughter got to an age where she would point at a penis in the changing room (women often bring their young sons to changing rooms here) and say ""Poop!"".

655,Apparently some do.I haven't checked myself though because there is not enough brain bleach in the world.
656,"I took it up mean the kid has seen ‘mummy’s’ willy, probably at bath time or something, and asked what it was, which is why they need to find a different word other than penis etc. But you’re right, they will have to teach the kid about the birds and the bees at some point, In which case it’s either abusive or absolutely hilarious because the kid will either be hopelessly confused, OR, they’ll recognise straight away that the penis in the educational book they just read looks *exactly* like ‘mummy’s girldick’ and they’ll keep questioning and questioning until they suss this shit out for themselves and peak trans themselves... the more I think about it the more I think the latter could actually happen since kids are notorious for cutting straight past the bulls hit and seeing clearly where adults are clouded by ideology and  social graces. It was after all a child that pointed out the emperors new clothes - and I know it’s only fiction, but there is a reason it was a child and it’s because they are good at this sort of thing."

Like yea maybe your kid touches his junk here and there. But if hes literally tugging on the foreskin, refusing to stop, and saying things like ""no one plays with me so I play with my penis"" (LITERALLY just read this in a mommy blog cause i had to look this shit up). Sounds ridiculous to me, like some deeper issue is going on and that's not normal at all."

671,"They require genital reconstructive surgery in order for someone to legally change their sex, a symptom of that is sterilization."
672,They are required to have “bottom” surgery. No half-assing it. This policy is under fire as being inhumane. Personally I don’t think people who’re allergic to basic facts and reality should be raising children.
673,All countries used to require surgery. In the UK to get a gender recognition cert you still have to be looking into surgery but people just do that to con the panel then once they have the GRC they forget all about it and just boost online about being a legal women with a dick.
674,They require srs to legally transition that’s how they become ‘sterilized’. They just have a much higher barrier to entry generally.
675,What about it? We all make beds we have to lie in. Transitioning should be heavily weighed and all other avenues should be exhausted if anybody is worried about regrets.
676,"What about if a man keeps his penis, gets access to women's spaces and then rapes them? That's slightly more serious than one guy actively choosing to have srs."
677,"I honestly think there should be a debate about whether or not trans people should legally be allowed to raise kids.

Or at least if there should be a minimum latency period, like you can’t raise a kid until after 10 years minimum since you legally became trans. That way the craziness might be somewhat gone.

This topic wouldn’t go over well at all,  but if you KNOW a group has a very high chance of being mentally ill one way or another, wouldn’t it be prudent to perhaps not let them freely be in control of kids?"

It’s an interesting part of his body to him. But if I say “hey bud, that’s something we do in private” he immediately stops and moves on, because as a whole he doesn’t care that much.  Who are all of these little kids that are obsessed with their penises??  There must be some weird outside interference going on there."
693,I think it doesn't have to be physical abuse at all to have this effect; probably just being around a parent(s) who is a narcissist with a fetish out for everyone to see is enough to make a major impression on the child

699,"Theres a lot of problems with even attempting to bring something like this to a panel. One such problem is the fact that you dont have to be trans to be mentally unstable and have kids. Plenty of GC people are too mentally unstable to raise children, but they have children anyway. Should we take away the children from these people as well? If so, then it's not really a debate on trans people, but mentally unstable people in general. But then that leads to the problem of ""assuming"" that trans people are mentally unstable, which is not a hot topic for discussion in the PC world we live in. Because of this, people just wont hear it. They'll turn their ears off to it or scream and yell until the topic is removed from discussion. 

But even if we were able to get this discussion into the public forum, they would want proof that a child raised in a trans household is at risk of becoming mentally ill. This leads to even more problems, because even if that child ends up becoming trans, the trans community will just say ""THEY WERE BORN THAT WAY ITS NOT THE PARENTS FAULT"" or if they do become mentally ill then it's because ""SOCIETY BULLIED THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR TRANS PARENTS"". They will find a way to draw the narrative to represent their own agenda, and the faceless masses will agree with them so they dont appear to be oppressive shitlords. 

Honestly, it's just not worth the fuss. It's for the best that we quietly seethe to ourselves and circlejerk our distaste for the mental illness known as transgenderism amongst ourselves."
700,That is one hell of a slippery slope.
701,Frankly I am all about fetish discrimination. People with creepy sexual fetishes that they expose on other members of society outside of their bedrooms and TRULY consenting partners (not the whole “my husband likes this thing and it creeps me out but I do it anyway because marriage) should be evaluated before children are allowed in their care. These parents are parenting a toddler and literally going to tell the kid that dad excuse me “mom” has a “big clit”? Are you fucking kidding me?
702,"Disagree. I know a FtM/woman couple who are raising a kid and, as far as I can tell, doing a good job of it. More importantly, I think that ""there should be a debate about whether or not _______ should legally be allowed to raise kids"" is a line straight out of the prologue to a dystopian novel, unless the word in the blank is ""pedophiles."""

Very rarely do kids have any sexual interests early on. I don’t know any young boys, including myself early on, who frequently “played with their bits”."
714,I have never heard of that actually  happenig in real life. Any child asking these questions before they are in kindergarten is being coached.
715,This kills the cat
716,Your defeatism in the face of evil is pretty pathetic if I’m being honest. Action on issues like this > inaction. Inaction is precisely why this issue has managed to get to this stage.
717,"Yea that’s why I said a debate and mentioned it would be really hard to actually have one. I realize it’s a slippery slope and a very sensitive topic.

But at the same time, rational people look at situations like the one OP posted and are just like “seriously? Come on. Why are these people even allowed to have kids?”"

723,"Let me guess, your ""research"" is from google searching and finding tumblr blogs and buzzfeed articles?

The term ""genderqueer"" was also just synonymous for ""gender neutral"" or ""gender nonconforming"", none of which are modifiers of male and female genders and not used as its own 3rd+ gender until tumblr.

Nonbinary being used as its own gender separate from male and female is entirely a tumblr thing too. Its origin is mostly used by tumblrinas who think that not liking pink and femininity makes them the ultimate #notlikeothergirls, which they call nonbinary. 

It's not a real thing. It's a made-up thing with no actual verifiable evidence."
724,"I have a 2 year old girl and she has pointed and asked. We don’t make a big deal out of it, just use the correct words, which she repeatsa couple of times then lets it go.

She doesn’t ask unless she sees one of us in the shower though or when I go to the bathroom and she demands to follow along. She knows she and I have different genitals than daddy."
725,"Played with their bits does not mean its in any way sexual. I've been told I liked to run about and swing my tiny dick around when I was little. I actually remember my little brother thinking his morning wood was hilarious, because he ran around and made light saber noises while swinging his hips around."
726,"It's 100% true that even infant boys play with their penises. Ask any pediatrician. It's not sexually gratifying or anything, but they can get erections, and they definitely play around with their parts. Sorry to weird you out with this info."
727,"Kids ask questions about *everything*. If they notice that one of their parents has an anatomy part that they don't have, why *wouldn't* they ask about it? Just because not all of them notice doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the ones who do. I am totally against these parents teaching their kids the wrong words and confusing them about genitalia, but it's not necessarily as dark as some people are making out."

733,"That sounds about right, they need to all take part in the Oppression Olympics."
734,"No, it definitely wasn't. When I first got into LGBT activism (around 2001/2002), it was used to describe people who were non-binary. Bear in mind this wasn't amongst people exclusively my own age; the people I worked with were from mid-teens up to 60s or so, people active in the zine community and in more traditional political spheres as well as academics. People talked about non-binary gender identity, and it wasn't a new debate. I know what I'm talking about because I was *there*."

It doesn't change the fact that it's not a real thing and not a 3rd gender that's different from male/female."
742,I’m afraid I don’t understand what you mean. If a child for example sees their parent getting out of the bath they may point and say “what’s that?” That aspect perfectly normal and natural and there is nothing dark or weird about that.

745,Do you really think that academics and people who cut their teeth protesting Section 28 are the same people posting to tumblr? *Really*?
746,"Because when a child is asking he doesn't understand the context. They're asking just like it's anything else on the body. That's normal, but for a child to randomly ask what moms genitals are without a reason like your example, and what they're used for, at two years old means they already heard this in conversation before or were coached. No 2 year old just walks up and randomly asks about someone else's genitals and their use without getting the idea from an adult or some type of media. 

I agree with you mostly though, especially on that last part."

750,"""Academics"", being gender studies students that post their hot-takes on girls who hate pink and like trucks actually being ""nonbinary agender queerfluid anti-boys?"" Absolutely.

I don't doubt that tumblrinas with their made-up ""Queer"" genders/sexualities like ""biosexual demigender starfluid flameboy"" believed in this ridiculous nonsense even before tumblr existed; this is how they managed to worm their way into LGB in the first place by pretending they're some oppressed fake gender/sexuality that the think makes them just like LGB, when they aren't. 

I do call made-up genders/sexualites like biogender, starfluid, etc. as ""tumblr genders/sexualities"" but yes, thanks for pedantically pointing out that people likely believed in this nonsense even before tumblr existed."
751,"I’m sorry but that’s a really weird conclusion to come to. If a child sees a body part on their parent - especially when it’s one they haven’t got themselves - it would be quite natural to ask what it is, especially if, as seems to be the case here, they know the names of all the other body parts but their parents have avoided mentioning one in particular.

I feel bad for this reporter (and the other one) but this reporter is gonna get shit for calling yaniv a 'crazy fucking thing'.

sidenote: i'm not sure if pornhub is correctly tracking actual women's interests. I looked at the top 10 searches for that category on their 2019 Review and most of them were disgusting to me. But hey, I don't even like porn."
898,These people are sex addicts!  Literally their entire life revolves around their genitals and sex lives!
899,"Pretty sure that women are more into the romance part of the sex and the ""popular for women"" would be less focused on orgies and more focused on just two people.

------

Remember, if you like the colour pink, you actually have a girl penis.

/s"
900,do porn addicts make profiles on that site? how does it know whos a female or male?
901,"So I'm no porn expert (in fact I find the stuff disgusting and in an ideal world there would be no supply or demand for it), but I'm fairly sure that men and women alike can usually  find something they enjoy in the ""female friendly"" category because it's going to be less based around misogyny than regular porn is, and misogyny is a huge turnoff for pretty much any decent person."
902,"They aren't even looking up videos popular with women anyway since the vast majority of ""women"" on there are men"
903,So women who masturbate to porn aimed at men are actually men? Wow.
904,"This is hilarious because the ""popular with women"" tag isn't for women. It's for guys who want to feel better for looking at porn by excusing it with ""well, if women like these videos, I guess I'm not sexist for watching them"""
905,Maybe he just doesn’t like the stuff that’s popular with men? Who could blame him.
906,Just so people know that tag usually has more softcore porn so they're literally saying that men cannot like softcore porn.
907,"It’s weird, people who don’t watch porn don’t have this this issue"
908,"Porn for women is generally softer and more romantic. So because soft and romantic= woman, that makes you a woman? No. It just means you want to watch something more romantic. God these people do everything to convince themselves that they’re valid."
909,"Maybe they're just regretting a culturally manufactured addiction to pornography and are trying to find a way to feel less guilty about it being harmful to everyone involved and in doing so gravitate more towards what's labeled ""popular with women"" to try and feel less guilty?"
910,Fucking morons
911,"I hate this because I also end up watching the same thing on pornhub, but does that mean I am now a trans woman or whatever? No! I wouldn't be able to keep a straight face if I tried to tell someone that I was a woman inside. Not with my thick beard and my muscles strong enough to knock my weighted punching bag over in one punch easily."
912,Its just a joke. They dont actually think that searching by certain results makes them a woman.
913,[deleted]
914,There is some supposedly female watched porn subreddit and it was much different than the tab on the hub.
915,Their Popular with Women looks disgusting partially because it probably means Popular with People Who Don't Identify as Cis Heterosexual Men. So some women and a lot of gender specials.
916,"I think it's so weird because a large amount of Female PH accounts are actually men. Either because they're too pretentious for ""MtF"", or as a way to stay more anonymous, or as a joke or a ""why not""."
917,"Personally I don't know how any woman can genuinely enjoy porn, being that most of the situations in porn are violent, borderline pedophilic, or incestuous, and considering it is well-documented that women in the porn industry are constantly threatened, mistreated, and coerced into situations they don't want to be in. When you watch porn, there's a good chance you are watching someone being raped."
918,"They’re porn addicts who mostly have a complete lack of real sexual experience, it’s what drives their AGP. If these people were to lay off porn, socialize more, and maybe find partners/be more honest about their sexuality they’d never even think about being trans."

I find it very easy to tell the difference most of the time, and I imagine a lot of other women do too. But men seem to find it very challenging.

for this reason, I would guess that most content on r/menwritingwomen is submitted by women. 

It would be very interesting to see a study where the authors asked people to guess what gender random posts were written by, and see if women are more likely to correctly guess posts written by other women, and vice versa for men given posts written by other men."
931,"[Imagine having orgasms while watching women be abused and degraded, day after day, and not thinking that will affect your psyche in any way.](https://i.redd.it/wfz9tl5rlb641.png)"
932,"It’s extremely easy to internalize the constant abuse of your anatomy as being sexy when it’s all you’ve ever known and what viable men in your dating pool respond positively towards. it’s hard to even process what witnessing abuse looks like when it’s identical to all the sex you’ve ever had.

Edit: not defending porn just saying this is subjugation by design."
933,"I’ll admit I’ve tried it but I always end up imagining myself in that girl’s position, which just disgusts me."
934,I occasionally watch lesbian porn targeted at women. It's actually sensual and not the least bit violent in anyway.
935,So sad how Reddit is AGGRESSIVELY pro-porn. For some reason overindulgence and abuse of porn/masturbation is glorified. Don't even start with discussing the porn industry with them. Disgusting.
936,You can’t be a trucel if you allow a female woman to steal your manna
937,And the other 30% are lying haha.
938,"I'm not sure if you can really categorize the appeal of some videos to females based on the porn genre.

That's why there's a separate category. It might be ""Lesbians"" but is it Lesbians in a lesbian orgy or two lesbians being all sensual."
939,"The website has Google Analytics within the code so you are correct. With a Google account, provided you have not lied about it, it knows almost 100% and without it, the algorithms can guess with stunning accuracy, especially if it's collecting data off forms where you have to state your sex and, again, you have not lied.

I honestly don't know what Google would guess if I logged out of my Google account since I've blocked every single tracker in my browsers."
940,"Yep.

They send em out once or twice a year"
941,"So pornhub is 75% men and 25% men with AGP. 

Kidding, I’m sure some of them are actually women... but not 25%."
942,Yeeeah selecting female when making an account =/= actual woman. I'm sure it's mostly a mix of TIMs and just regular dudes doing that.

963,"For the people in this thread mentioning the trans murder statistics, I saw someone on twitter break it down...

The US population is somewhere around 329,000,000. Thus far in 2019, 18 trans people have been murdered. If we estimate the trans population at .6%, that would mean there are approximately 1.9 millions trans ppl in the US.1219📷

Out of those 1.9 million, 18 have been murdered in 2019. That's about 1 victim for every 105,000 trans people. In 2016, approximately 12.2 women out of every 100,000 women were victims of homicide, and that was up from 10.2 in 2015. I am sorry for anyone who dies a violent...1829📷

My interest in participating in these subs is to show other women the TiM in the stall next to you likely isn't the 'totally just another woman' she's been promised so hopefully she'll wise up and join the movement or at least keep her wits about her same as she would around any other man. Or, to show any lurking TiMs there might be another explanation for their 'dysphoria', AGP/porn addiction, while all the gender clinics and TRAs shove them on the express train towards transitioning so maybe they reevaluate before doing something irreversible. 

If anything I really just want people to have more information to make them safer, on both sides of the fence. I would never wish harm or violence on anyone no matter how much I disagree with them and I wouldn't participate in a sub that didn't make it an explicit rule."
1029,Exactly.
1030,I agree with your comment.

But I thought they were getting murdered by the 1000s?"
1036,"TiMs took over crossdressing and gender non-conforming spaces. All the people that aren't ""women"" are now kicked out and called hateful bigots.

The number of people who think because I somtimes wear the wrong shape/color of fabric means I must get my dick cut off is insane."
1037,"You’re totally right!  I try really hard to let my kids know that they can talk to me about anything (the older one so far, anyways). It’ll be even more important when they start getting into the teenage years, but the general message is going to be that if they have something personal to talk about, I’ll always listen and I’ll never get mad or make them feel judged about it."
1038,"I have a few friends that go into detail about their sex life with their family and that’s incredibly strange to me. Like “Hey Mom, sucked some dick last week, it was pretty good not gonna lie.” Who the fuck does that?"

1063,It's very different depending on where and in what context I suppose. I just don't think it'd go over well in daily life though. Of course there are factors there as well but you catch my drift.
1064,just don't look up the dickvore

Makes sense doesn’t it?"
1068,"The funny thing is, I actually looked up trans murder rate when I was getting lectured about how I can't make trans jokes. In 2019 alone, a whole 18 have been murdered with 15 left unsolved. I'm not a detective, but something tells me it leads back to them being sex workers and listening to the other mentally ill saying you don't need to tell them you have a penis because it's not gay."

It sounds like it's safer to be a tg prostitute than an actually female one.  Yet we don't hear about the plight of women trafficked to their deaths annually - it's only the trans that matter."

They just get banned periodically and then a new one pops up to repeat the cycle

I think we have to admit that the project of this sub fundamentally goes against Reddit's core beliefs, and they will be looking for any reason to ban us. While I agree we shouldn't hand them that reason, we shouldn't be too zealous in our moderation either, as people here express frustration or disgust they are not able to express irl.

Trans ideology labels our belief that they are not women as violence in itself anyway, no matter how much we sugar coat it. When Reddit admins inevitably accept that premise, we'll be banned, so why take extra measures to prevent it?"
1082,"Ironic , since I just described the trans movement"

To a man, there is nothing more important than his dick, and even cosplaying as a woman cannot get in the way of it.

1125,"Why are these people just perpetually horny at any given moment?


It reminds me of the vast majority of furries I've encountered honestly (There is overlap, I am aware.) They'll complain how they're just oppressed and rejected by SOCIETY all the fucking time, how the majority of the fandom isn't actually porn, how people just don't understand. But then every other waking second of their online interaction feels like they've just devolved into a machine intent on nothing but sex, porn, cock, depraved fetishes, uwu/OwO, and whatever the fuck.


The complete lack of self-awareness from these groups is baffling. Yeah, no fucking wonder people won't interact with you when the average individual DOESN'T just think and discuss nonstop about coom."

1160,"No you have not, it’s biologically impossible in humans as far as we know and there has never been a recorded case. 

There are “intersex” people who have underdeveloped sex organs (if male) or partially male developed sex organs (if female), which is basically a penis that didn’t fully develop and so still has maybe some “labia” or a tiny shaft, or if you’re a woman maybe a really large clitoris that seems like a micro penis because for some reason androgens were affecting you during development.

And there are those truly depraved MTFs that get SRS and ask the doctors to keep the penis but use colon tissue to make a “vagina” under it. And as we ALL know here, a “neovagina” is in NO WAY a vagina.

So no, you have not seen a true Futa. They will not exist until medical technology has improved substantially. And even then it will likely only be possible for biological females to have an organ-grown penis and balls attached to them. I could see that being a possibility in the future."
1161,"No, no, it does not.

1164,"There is no actual dysphoria and a fake one. It has some definition, and any fetishist can say ""I want to be a woman, I don't want to be a man"" and if he felt that way for some time, he has dysphoria. Fetish does not disqualify anyone nor the opinion on genitals. You may wish for a distinction as much as you want, but there just isn't one. It's a false dichotomy. Though I don't think it even matters. What you do isn't more okay just because you can justify it. Any fetishist can say what you say, do what you do, and claim to be real and it's impossible to disprove. Why? Because you are all fake."
1165,"Okay, thank you. It was definitely not my intention to like say that all men are sex perverts... but if the label doesn’t apply, then there’s no need to freak out, you know? If you’re a man and you’re not a pervert, then don’t get upset when I make remarks about men who are perverts. Nbd."

1168,EXACTLY. What’s that old saying again? “A hit dog hollers.”
1169,"What is ""not okay"" with man pretending to be a woman and forcing everyone else to support this delusional fantasy? Maybe start with asking women that post here and try to find out why this sub even exists. Just because you may be less fetishistic (if you even are, who knows) it does not make everything you do okay. My AGP also always was there, but I don't act on it. Because I have a little decency and respect for others. You also don't need to be trans. You can just not take hormones, not crossdress, not claim to be a woman and not take it out to public etc. But of course, you just want to be happy, so who cares for the cost of it?"

1171,"Other mentally ill people are also just being themselves. But only gender dysphorics get encouraged in their illness. Nobody would say to anorexic person: yeah, you need to stop eating and lose weight. Nobody would say to paranoid person: yes, your delusions are real, government is coming for you. So why say to trans: yes, you really are other sex and everyone else has to respect this lie? Like it's even possible or a real concept? Again, your dysphoria is not a ""I can do whatever I want"" card. You can't also use suicide in that way. It just doesn't work, your behavior is still wrong and you could live without doing the whole trans thing. You will be a man anyway because that's what you were born as.

1237,"they do, you just don't know they do it"
1238,"Ya know I don't know the history of this meme but that always struck me as bizzare. The character is smaller and less developed because she was starved by her abusive dad, she's bad at social interactions because she grew up treated like shit and has arrested development, and then she kills herself.

Why... why adopt that character as a mascot?"

^edit ^stupid ^typo"
1243,Let's rephrase it this way - I stopped worrying about how my breasts looked when I needed to use them for their purpose. Feeding my baby.
1244,Downvotes are because usually (and again true in this case) a lot of our brigaders pretend to be confused by basic radfem terms. Usually genuine confusion would include a normal full sentence question in a non hostile tone. This in-bad-faith “?” is coming from a man who mostly uses reddit to comment on porn subs.
1245,"It's possibly even a more extreme version of the origin story.

Narcissus was attracted to his reflection, but he didn't masturbate to it or get erections or anything like that (as far as we know)."
1246,"Or people who are super addicted to porn so they associate any nudity, even their own, with sex"
1247,"So straight? Why would straight men be attracted to any penis, never mind their own?"
1248,"Not always, in chemistry. “Cis” just means “same”, so a cis-molecule would have its substituents on the same side of a double bond. “Trans” means “other”, so they’d be on opposite sides. Depending on the reaction conditions, molecules could have the cis isomer as the major product, or they could have the trans isomer as the major product. It’s not about which one is more common.

It’s used the same way, I guess. “Cis” meaning “gender same as sex”."
1249,Please explain - what have I said that's untrue? What's aap?
1250,They dont care about her character. They just like using petite undrage anime girls as an avatar for themselves because thats their transition goal apparently :/
1251,"As far as I know the character that kills herself is different from the character who is abused and socially stunted.

To answer your question, they uncritically crowd to any petite anime girl they can find - because they're self-inserting hebephile creeps - and this one sticks out because she's from a popular fad game that came out a few years back."
1252,"Which is what it was intended to do. During the first wave (pre-1980?) of transsexuals, that term was very clear - and that’s all there was. Transsexual. 

The new trans and TRAs have used language to hide and distort their social/political/sexual agenda, bully, coerce, dominate discourse, seek power and the upper hand. It’s Orwellian."
1253,"O-okay? I guess that's valid enough, but the way you worded it was weird as hell and kinda sounded like smth a dude would say about boobs"
1254,"Oh I didn't even notice, gross. Thanks!"
1255,">Narcissus was attracted to his reflection, but he didn't masturbate to it or get erections or anything like that (as far as we know).

Narcissus was a healthy young man who fell under a curse that caused him to have such an obsessive attraction to the physical image of another (Narcissus did not realize the image he was looking at was himself) that it drove him to suicide. Him being sexually attracted to his own image under the curse is strongly implied. I think comparing them to Narcissus is pretty apt."
1256,"No, cis people can be gay or lesbian. It’s not about sexual orientation. It’s about whether you think the doctor and science were right when they said you were a boy or girl at birth (leaving aside the instances of intersex which is another issue.

Cis is a made up term, invented by TRAs (Trans Rights Activist’s) to label the rest of us, the majority of people,  as “others”. This labeling is a linguistic act of aggression. There is no need for a qualifier before “man” or “woman”.

Increasingly, many lesbians and gays, as well as some boys, and many if not most heterosexuals reject this term. Even some trans who medically transitioned fully (who tend to be older and stand in opposition to the new TRAs) - most notably transman Buck Angel - are starting to argue against the use of “cis”."
1257,Orientation​ and identity are different.
1258,"Yeah, I don't think any man is attracted to their own dick. But cis doesn't necessarily mean straight. If you were born a female and identify as one and you like men, you're a straight cis woman. If you were born a female and identify as a female and you like women, you're a lesbian cis woman."
1259,[deleted]
1260,Oh whoops you're totally right. The small girl and the girl who kills herself are different. My bad.
1261,"Yup. Recently read a quote about how once they can get you to say that something true is false, they can get you to say or think anything. 

So I’ve made an effort to point out instances of “doublethink” to my friends and family. It’s amazing how just doing that can come across as hateful to them."
1262,"Dali took it to the next level, though."
1263,In what way? So you can be gay and cis?
1264,"But what’s the point? How can you ‘identify’ as a gender, you’re born one or the other..."
1265,What you've never been turned on by your own body? I have - I'm a man who's attracted to men's bodies & I really resent that you suggest that is equivalent to what these T fetishists are doing. I hardly think that's controversial - it's a well-known fact that men react to all sorts of things - boys getting erections at all sorts of things - if you were a man how could you not know that?
1266,"Good for you! Very brave. 

When you point out the doublethink to allies of trans you are also pointing out that they have been duped - and duped in the sense of brainwashing. No one likes that feeling even if they can’t articulate it. So they label it bigotry or hateful which are the politically correct tropes of the day. They might even lash out angrily toward you. 

When you point out doublethink to a trans person their fragile sense of self starts to crumble with nothing to replace it. They often come out raging, projecting what they are doing on to you. They may engage in bullying and threats - anything not to face the truth."
1267,"> Recently read a quote about how once they can get you to say that something true is false, they can get you to say or think anything

Joseph Goebbels was ahead of his time. He is currently salivating in hell at the tools of the 21st century for mass manipulation.

He also envisioned cable TV decades before it became a reality and yes...it was for the purpose of deception.

This quote from Goebbels could've just as easily been said today....

*If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State*"

1355,"This is mostly true from what I’ve read. 

If you wear a bra, you need to wear them all the time. If you don’t, then never wear one. 

However, I also think women’s diets are leading to larger and larger breasts, so they need to wear one anyway. 

I’ve also read that they can grow larger when you wear a bra because they aren’t limited by supporting their own weight.  

Source: was lingerie specialist for many years."
1356,That makes no sense. Preventing gravity from doing its thing would have the opposite impact.

1359,"That’s...not true at all. I’m 37 and even after two kids my boobs are still fairly perky.  Before the kids, very much so. One of the benefits of being smaller, I guess."

1363,"Considering the level of homophobia still common in black communities, I wouldn't be surprised if it played a bigger role than in the white community. I wouldn't go so far as to say ""most"" though. Black men love their porn as much as white men."
1364,"You mean... they look... what’s the word... unnatural? Huh. That can’t be, can it!?"
1365,There's some men with not be y broad shoulders which get away with it with augmentation but that's not very common
1366,Glad I could be of service 🙏
1367,"Never heard about them growing while wearing a bra, it definitely never helped me aha. Mine grew once I was finally able to gain weight.

I can see the benefit in a bra if your breast are quite large. That extra support should help alleviate back pain. It only makes sense."
1368,"As I've heard it explained, the bras providing support prevent the muscles in the area from strengthening through use.

I'm not going to fight tooth and nail about the veracity here, I'm not a boob scientist. But it certainly sounds plausible to me."
1369,"It makes sense if you think about them as muscles, which is what I've read. 

Can't really tell what's really true though. It makes sense they would want us to buy expensive bras thinking we are supporting them when really we are just wasting money. I don't see anyone making any money claiming women should free their tits. 

Follow the money!"
1370,"> Mine haven't ""gone down south"" and they're not small, and I'm in my 30s. I don't know what to tell you. Some people are different.

As a dedicated boob aficionado, I can confirm that:

* some girls have big boobs that are perky

* some girls have small boobs that are saggy

From what I can see, it mostly comes down to DNA."
1371,"That's ok, but it's not the case for the majority of women (I'm like you, but this isn't really the point of the post).

They're talking about girls that are just developing."

1381,"Did yours start to sag when you were 13? I'm an A cup so maybe that makes a difference.

Also I only got mine when I was like 13 haha"
1382,"D-cup, they were done by 13. Mine developed naturally and they're a bit down. But not down to my knees like everyone thinks. Boobs, regardless always sag a bit, just a teensy bit.

I’m glad he brought up r/incest. That’s a fetish, right? Just like what he has going on. So close to self-awareness. So. Close.

dude you're abnormal. just because other dudes fantasize about family members and jerk off into underwear doesn't make it normal or healthy.

So you've done something sexual towards her against her will, but you could have done something even worse so it's okay?

>but it's more like that I wish I could be her.

So... an embodiment fantasy?

>Do you know how hard it is?

Nobody wants to hear about how hard you are, sir.

>Watching someone else have and be everything you want?

By definition, this is untrue. You don't want what she has and is, by definition you cannot know what she has and is because you are a male who has never experienced womanhood for a day in his life. What you want is what you fantasize about her having and being.

>Even her name is freaking perfect and it would even suit me too.

It would not. You are not who you wish to be, only who you are.

>While I am living life on hard mode.

You are a heterosexual man in a first world country. You live the easiest life any human ever has or will, and you live it at the expense of others.

No, it is not normal to masturbate with your sister's dirty underwear.  It is extremely narcissistic and I genuinely fear for his sister and his creepy obsession with her.

Why don't you ask your sister for permission to jerk off in her panties? Tell her that line about how the folks in r/incest think it's fine, see how that works out.

You know what you're doing is disgusting and creepy, you know you're violating her privacy and she'd hate you if she found out, and you know the selfishness, the perversity and the lack of empathy for real women is 100% male. You're acting like a serial killer, not like a woman."

You damn well should be ashamed of yourself. What you're doing is awful, and how you're rationalizing it is potentially even more so. Fuck you for your selfishness, your inconsiderate bullshit, and for trying to pass on this feeling of shame as anything other than your bullshit-choked moral compass' feeble attempts to guide you. 

Think about how your sister would feel. If you have even a shred of empathy or more than a single brain cell still functioning, think about what it'd be like to have someone you trusted violate you in that way. Not your 'lmao sexy' porn sick way, but the fucking trauma that'd cause. Then remember she's been told men are just like that her whole life. Then remember you're trying to use your violation of her to replace her, and claiming you're a ""real woman"" because of it. Then remember you're a piece of shit who is doing all that, right now, and that you need to stop years ago. Go get a fucking shrink."

1476,"NORMAL DOES NOT MEAN GOOD.

I'm so fucking sick of ""Everyone does it, so it's normal and healthy!""

Nobody says murder is healthy, and yet it's a 'normal' part of human society. Nobody says theft is healthy, and yet it's perfectly normal to want to take things that don't belong to you (as in, everyone's thought it, not ""everyone is a kleptomaniac""). 

For most of human history, rape was normal and yet everyone agrees that rape is fucking horrible.


And you know what? The guy isn't even right. Out of seven billion people you can find a lot of people with incestuous feelings, but statistically it is **rare**. It is **not normal**. Anyone who has taken a college sociology class can tell you that there are so many psychological safeguards in place to prevent that.


And hey, I know you're probably reading this and have all sorts of prepared arguments to regurgitate, so let me just tell you:

**I don't care.** Your bullshit is so obvious a mile off, and anyone not tainted by your delusion can see it.


And lastly,

>Akin to bullying, but I'm used to it

It's not bullying, it's holding you up as an example to make sure nobody else becomes a creepy pervert. Just like all the other 'bullies' have been doing with you.

Everyone goes through stuff. Most people don't jack off in another person's underwear. If you are so afraid of 'feeling ashamed', maybe there is a good reason for that."

When I was young, I couldn't get a girlfriend to save my life. And then I tried a bunch of stuff and figured out what works.

Protip: If you're 20 years old, and you want a girlfriend, the easiest way to get one is *to ask a girl out.* You can lift weights until you're blue in the face, but if you don't actually ask a girl out, you're wasting your time.

1614,I've cracked the code. Euphoria = Intense sexual arousal that the TiM is unfamiliar with because looking at so much porn has made most sexual arousal boring to them.
1615,Guarantee you he looked *nothing* like any of those girls
1616,Fuckin weird man
1617,Because it’s a fetish. A super obvious fetish most people do not want to participate in.

1657,"I think that if you have a fetish, *nothing else does it for you.*

Here's an example:

A few years back, my wife and I decided to check out the ""swinger"" scene. Our expectation was that people in the scene would be having tons of sex. Much to our surprise, a lot of the men in the scene can't get it up anymore. We went to a couple parties, and it was full of women getting tied up in BDSM gear, but nobody was actually fucking. I watched some dude get blown for nearly an hour, and he couldn't get erect enough to penetrate his partner.

Another thing I noticed about the scene, was that we were literally the only people in a conventional relationship. Everyone else was poly or divorced.

I definitely wondered if their pursuit of a fetish led to the end of their relationships."

1665,"My now TiM brother stole a pair of my underwear once, I found them in his room and slapped the crap out of him while he laughed about it.

At the time he claimed it was to show to his friends. I don't know which is worse, but it was very violating and upsetting."
1666,"> I feel like this is secretly a GC person pretending to post this to piss of TIMs.

There's way too many of them saying the same thing. If you're going to believe one is a troll, then just believe it's all trolling.

This is one of the reasons this sub is so problematic and they want it gone. It documents their own words and when someone says "" Oh they're not being serious. Trans aren't really like that."", there's a mile long list of examples showing that yes....they really are like that."

1675,"I think that a lot of these men are deluded enough that what they see in the mirror is not what is actually there. You know? In the same way that an anorexic who is dangerously underweight can look at themselves and genuinely see a fat body.

1676,"Oh 100% at least some do. I mean, that just follows from every community having shitty people in them (in my opinion).

>It really confused me because I never really felt like I was in the wrong body, but people kept saying that I should transition.


It's called puberty. It's completely normal to not feel completely secure in your body until you are in your late 20's, especially when you're being fed a load of post modernist bullshit about how genders are a social construct, a sociological pet theory started by a pedophile who abused two boys to the point of them both committing suicide."
1711,"For me it’s not really a fetish to cross dress, but I totally get the appeal! I enjoy it too. And yeah, I don’t need to go as far as transitioning. I like my body, thank you. As others have said: fly and spread the word!"

1740,I don’t think having certain perversions makes you inherently evil or deserving of punishment. It’s possible to help these people live normal lives.
1741,"No, I was dealing with some intense self hatred due to internalized homophobia. I thought transition would make me 'normal' and that my family and society would accept me if I was a guy dating a woman. I'm a lesbian, fairly butch, and it was like my own self inflicted conversion therapy. 

My detransition has been very successful so I'm one of the lucky ones and feel a moral obligation I guess to warn others. Including those who do it for fetish reasons because I'm not devoid of compassion. There are a lot of reasons people get sucked into transitioning and people who want to live out their fetish 24/7 are not in a healthy place. But mainstream LGBTQ+ culture is enabling it all."
1742,"It can be so toxic when you watch too much. I would define too much as continuing to search for newer things to get off to- it’s a dark hole and actually rewires the brain.

I am a female who is comfortable with her female body but I have struggled with depression and anxiety and I am a former cutter. I think a lot of what bothers me is sexual reassignment surgery feels a lot like mutilation to me. Were you offered therapy by anyone before they tried to persuade you to transition? Honestly I am all for people doing whatever they want with their lives as long as it doesn’t hurt other people but when I hear about children transitioning it makes me angry. I wonder if trans gendered people want to recruit more people To validate their own choices.

1752,"Quite to the contrary, fetishes are common and banal. You should feel secure in your fetishes- at least in so far as they don't involve *hurting* someone else- but you should also recognize that fetishes have a time and place, and consent is *always* a factor in them.

A few people did ask if I had perused therapy, but they were mostly drown out by the massive call of people telling me I'm actually trans.

I think the thing with the trans community is that they want to be supportive, but don't know how to approach the question of therapy. If you find a therapist who is not trans friendly then you're ""just hurting the person more by denying them of their true body"" or something like that, and that's oppressive, and we can't have that. 

But at the same time you need a therapist who will make you seriously consider your choices and make you question if you actually want to transition. It's a delicate line that professionals have a hard time walking, so I can't imagine the internet walking it well. So they just go full on supportive and hope for the best. Hey, it's not my body, right?"
1756,"No...according to that, ""the presence of autogynephilia increases the likelihood of gender dysphoria in men who also have transvestic disorder."". AGP does not *cause* the dysphoria, but makes it more likely in men who are already prone to the disorder."

Ok. I can tell you though, as an actual female, that no group of women ever sat there talking about womanhood being a sliding scale, or thought that having a penis would make them better or more deserving women than those who didn't ""earn it""(LOLOLOLOL). Its just so typical. They are MRA in drag. Its pretty damn male to just decide their ego matters more than what being a woman actually IS. Or any what comes along with being female either physically or socially... somehow never has anything to do with womenhood, because they personally can't experience it.

They literally think y'all are freak shows and they're right. Trans people do not pass at all, particularly men who feel like they are women. Maybe if they're black out drunk, maybe....but once they discover a fucking penis they will run as fast as they can. Its so hilarious how out of touch with reality people are. Actions speak louder than words. Think about the constant affirmation trans people get online, just words. But what about real life? Women don't accept them. Straight men definitely do not. I don't know about gay men but trans people would definitely feel better if they just admitted they were gay. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Being trans, you'll never have sex with a straight man, will never be feminine, will always be a laughingstock outside of the media and the internet. Why someone would choose this over accepting that they are gay, the world will never know. May too much internet, isolation as a child, no friends, too much porn, virgins, etc."
1813,"God this is so logically screwed up I don’t know where to start picking it apart.

Redrawing the definition of a woman by picking and choosing the aspects that suit them. 

Then claiming some kind of supreme status among women for making a choice...that is logically completely impossible for them to make in an informed way. They have never lived an entire experience of a woman, physical, social and psychological. What is their precious choice predicated on? What exactly do they think they are choosing?

The most stupid contradiction of all? We ALL technically choose to be a woman. Every single day we biological women don’t choose to go under the knife and become a man. Y’know, the way they became women?"

BUT DONT YOU EVER FUCKING DARE SAY THAT YOU ARE MORE OF A WOMAN THAN I AM. I have dealt with miscarriage, excruciating period pains, an ex who I was madly in love with but who cheated on me with prostitutes, and you want to say that you are MORE OF A WOMAN THAN ME?? bitch you still have a cock and pee standing up.

The 2016 election basically confirmed it with all the chatter around foreign influence over the internet and social media, but it seemed like people didn't get the gravity of the situation.

It makes total sense. Social media is basically a window to the minds of an entire nation's youth, and only in the most free countries (the west) did you really have that off the bat.

Cisgender, either male or female (which is invariable used pejoratively) is a modern pseudo word which has no working etymology but attempts to force some other scientific etymology (relating to molecular chemistry) to serve an entirely erroneous purpose.  It is an attempt to define in terms that have nothing to do with those being defined so as to make those so described seem parallel with those who have ""chosen"" to define otherly.

It isn’t even hard to find posts showing that it’s a fetish.  Every day there’s some weird ass post in mtf from someone thinking they’re trans because of sissy porn, or getting a boner because they stole underwear from their sister or mom.  When I first started getting into radical feminism I was skeptical about Blanchard’s AGP, but there’s a ridiculous amount of evidence for it on the trans subreddits."

Kind of like how you guys like to shadow ban GC users from your subs. I'm shadow banned from at least 2 trans-related subs that I never once posted in."
2045,They hate the truth because it’s so obvious once you understand AGP.
2046,So what if someone said they were trying to get r/trans banned?? Would that not be seen as ehrmagod bigoted?! What if people said they would do anything to get it banned? So ridiculous. They don’t like it when you call a spade a spade and that’s the reaction. Never mind that so many of the posts/screenshots on here from r/trans are LITERALLY RELATED TO FETISHES.
2047,"They need no one to question the root of their *identity* because it is entirely socially-constructed by themselves and other people humoring their delusions. If someone doesn't want to play pretend with them it's *violence*. It's why they always ask ""do you not think I exist?!?!"" That their entire sense of self rests on shaky ground gives others power to unravel their psyche just by questioning.

There's probably more grounds to ban r/trans than this fucking sub, because at least we aren't an echo chamber of vulnerable people telling each other to irreparably damage our bodies in pursuit of the unattainable."
2048,If they want this sub to go away then they need to quit being so gross.  This sub just reposts all the nasty gross fetish things that trans women post about their fetishes.  It just upsets them because it pulls their nastiness out into the light.

2074,"But this is exactly what happens on Reddit. The idea of letting people have their own things , even if you don't agree with them is no longer allowed anymore.

Put it like this. 
loli and shota, drawings get banned for being harmful to minors meanwhile, several of the transboards that specifically target real children and lure them into their creepy discords are still up. You know, I feel I shouldn't have to make the distinction between real and imaginary children but the way Reddit has been lately makes me do so.

Side note: I absolutely hate discord.  I just want to talk about/ play video games, not listen to mostly false, sometimes true stories of debauchery. Anyway.

A board about irrationally hating women is shut down, but any of the multiple boards about irrationally hating men are allowed to thrive - - *until they start hating transwomen!* THEN , it's time to shut them down. 

Name and shame is not allowed, until it's allowed.

Witchhunting is a global rule, it's just not allowed on this site---- until there are several boards completely dedicated to witch hunting and stalking. My favorite one, the one that's been stalking me for a year now finally got quarantined. Only after they targeted a fucking child - now they've been reduced to Frenworld nonsense trying to avoid being banned all together. 
This is noteworthy because for far too long this sub was above all the rules of Reddit. 

Being a pretend Communist is perfectly fine on Reddit, being a pretend Nazi is not. 
Even though both groups rounded up and killed people who disagreed, but don't say that on the commie subs. They'll have you hanged for that.

A board saying mean things about a billionaire liberal is considered a conspiracy board and shut down meanwhile, a board saying mean things about a billionaire conservative is considered normal and is allowed to operate. Fun Fact:* Both these men are terrible people and the fact that users on Reddit actually believe either of them are ""good guys"" is actually frightening to me.*

A board about how to get opiates is shut down - -yet several boards about how to get weed, cocaine and even make your own ""party favors""*Disclaimer: We do not condone or endorse this stuff, Safety not guaranteed* --  are still up and running. 

**Let's not even get into the endless amount abuse that the user verification systems have fostered over the years due to mods being sick , abusive assholes on the porn subs.**

A board of white people being racist assholes in the name of  politics is allowed to stay up while a board of white people being racist assholes just because they can, gets shut down.

tl;dr people like to pretend reddit is fair and just. 

Ultimately it's just a large chan with shittier rules than a regular chan - but unlike chans, people cannot play nice on reddit and just keep to their own circlejerks. They have to branch out and shut down other people's circlejerks in order to make themselves feel better.

But you know what?  I do not care about these subs. What I do care about is that all of them have the right to exist.  I know people hate me over the color of my skin, getting rid of their board doesn't change anything. 

I know people hate me over my opinions, boo hoo. I should still be able to post them and if someone feels like it, they should be able to argue with me without getting interrupted or brigaded or stopped by a pissy mod who doesn't like my colorful choice of words.

You can't have a real discussion if you surround yourself with people who only agree with you and nothing is honest when you force people to agree with you or risk losing their right to even post."

Who cares what specifically caused the dysphoria to occur in your mind? Who cares whether it was caused by society treating them badly or if it was caused by them watching too much porn or whatever? Lots of people aren't treated nicely by society and lots of people watch porn. Neither of these things directly cause dysphoria, because the majority of people who watch porn or get treated poorly by society don't start thinking that they can just declare themselves the opposite gender. 

It is ultimately still a problem with the individual. Lots of random psychopaths and serial killers experienced abuse and ostracism by society too. Are we supposed to blame society being meanies as the cause of everything's fault? No, we blame these psychopaths and serial killers for **choosing** to be shitty humans. I blame trans people for having the audacity and delusion they can just **choose** to become whatever the fuck gender they want to be and expect society to go along with it ""because society are meanies who have oppressed me"".

Are we supposed to blame society being meanies as the cause of everything's fault? No, we blame these psychopaths and serial killers for choosing to be shitty humans. I blame trans people for having the audacity and delusion they can just choose to become whatever the fuck gender they want to be and expect society to go along with it ""because society are meanies who have oppressed me"".

The unwritten implication here, and I agree with it, is that trans people are shitty humans: they are literally trying to force you to deny/rewrite reality."

Something tells me the same is going on with men at the rock bottom of masculinity. ""Be a man"" they're told, but they don't know how. ""Blegh"", they think.

I talked to a guy in long-term psychosis a few days ago and he was convinced that 1) 10-years-future-him could only change him 2) if someone wanted to help him it would only work if they did it 'right' 3) he couldn't articulate what would be the right kind of help and blamed the government (a continuation of the Nazis) for sending agents to cockblock him.

Not everyone has the option to talk about it with someone in their life of course and I get that, but the calmer posts around here have the right it that that some people are approaching gender in a fetishistic way. Not all, I dont think- I disagree with this sub on some of that- but I do think it is good to open the discussion to their being not one solution for everyone struggling with their gender in some way, shape, or form. My goal is to provide some support to these people but not through stereotyping fantasies of how the other sex ""works"" or fetishism encroaching on other public norms (e.g. underwear worn publically, etc).

This said, there are some pretty heinous comments around here. What's new? People are going to have differing opinions- I do."

2123,">trans people are shitty humans

Disagree. 

Are there shitty trans people? Of course there are. But there are also many, many trans people who are just imperfect humans trying to find their way in the world like all the rest of us.

Would love to know the true story here. THe doctor shopping reminds me of drug addicts. I'm sure the doctors involved with gender issues have noticed the same tactics and stories again and again, like pain management doctors do. I am interested in the documentaries that will come out eventually that details all of his kind of thing. Its madness."

Poster could very well go off, throw a hissy fit, lawyer up, and potentially sue doctor. Doctor will get a stiff (it is bad joke day🥳) letter from their HR telling them that they are transphobic and that they should apologize and review the diagnosis or else. Doctor may then be dismissed nonetheless. Such cases are commonplace in other fields.

The DSM has already been changed to accommodate the trans movement. Medical standards have already been rephrased, reshaped and distorted. That’s one of the main reasons I’m no longer silent about what’s happening. I am all for people expressing themselves, but not at the expense of reality or sound medical practice.

I will say it again: this doctor is either very stupid or very brave."
2172,"Why is he so concerned with a ""misdiagnosis"" being on the record specifically? Like it'll ruin his reputation or something? Is it that ""invalidating""?

From a personal experience, I was misdiagnosed with something a few years back. Basically what happened is that I saw an in-training doctor, described a symptom, and she immediately gave me a prescription without any further explanation. I thought it was weird, but mostly forgot about it, until 2 years later when I saw another doctor and she asked how my (insert medical condition I don't have) was doing, and I was like ""what? I don't have that"" Turns out that first doctor must've put down that I had that condition when she gave me the prescription, but after I explained that no, I was confident I didn't have any symptoms of that, it didn't seem to be too much of a big deal and I've never been asked about it since.

No idea if it's still on my record, but even if it is, it's not a big deal for me to explain that it was a fuck-up, and no, I've never even taken that medication prescribed because I don't need it."

The other one featured a dude who obviously liked to play dress up who worked in a law firm, if memory serves me. This was when they had to go thru stages of living as a ‘woman’ for a period of time before they were granted surgery. 

I will see if I can find it.."

That means I go in and out of lots of clinics and work with staff in lots of drs offices that provide therapy services too. 

The amount of similarity between the opioid epidemic, starting with Purdue pressing oxycontin on the public, and companies pushing hormones now is scary. On the face to someone that saw it go down it looks identical. Especially since pharmaceutical companies are taking suck hits now that the law is catching up to them. It makes perfect sense they would push out something new to get people hooked on."

If you are diagnosed as having depression, doctors may send you to a psychiatrist instead of treating the actual *pain*.  If you get diagnosed with a personality disorder, then doctors will be primed to think of you as being manipulative or lying about your symptoms."

Went to my doc to tell him about it, he just shook his head, smiled and told me to stop reading stuff online... but I pressed for him to refer me to a specialist and what do you know, I was fucking right. The test came back positive. All those years, countless doctors, and google is how I finally figured it out by myself. I'm gonna see the doc again soon just to tell him I was right, lol.

One of the ones who did go back to living as a man, runs a support group for people considering it. All three had it back before transition on demand became the norm, and they still regretted it eventually. And if I remember right, all three were abused as children.

I don't have the numbers but in my area(north east United states near NYC) it's clear that the population has exploded like if it was pokemon go. It's very clear these young women have zero idea what they're doing to their body permanently. 

Most of them I speak with are just normal lesbians. I dont understand when they try to bro out with me and comment on my new boots or truck or facial hair. The whole thing seems like a social contagion. I think the pharma industry is directly responsible. If hormones weren't being pushed so hard nobody would want to cut off their sexual organs to try to look like the other sex... because they'd never even pass a little.

2266,Don't these kinds of things are normally pretty esoteric to those not familiar with healthcare and modern health IT.

I'll check out the book you mentioned. However, this is a book. Books can be good, but this is not even literature, it's a non-scientific book for the general public written by a guy that did not even study medicine but is a therapist instead. 

If you want to make bold claims like these, you'll need tens if not hundreds of proper scientific studies, along with large scale systematic reviews and meta analyses peer reviewed by experts and committees and hundreds of scientific journal clubs. 

A book written by one person is not enough, let alone it nog even being a scientific literature book."

I see a few possibilities:
1) You're a genuine idiot who thinks one book can deconstruct an entire medical system
2) You lack education and have good intentions but are unintentionally a bigot
3) You know you are wrong to think like this without any scientific evidence, but don't want to/can't realize you should change your views, because you somehow gain something from calling others' mental problems a fetish instead of respecting them. That makes you an asshole."

No it hasn't.

Seriously, though.  I don't constantly think about my childhood.  I am around people all the time that had normal childhoods and mine was extremely negative.  I hardly think about it unless someone brings something up in relation to it.  I'm far too busy focused on being an adult.  

It's not normal to constantly miss out on the 'girlhood' you could have had.  It's bizarre.  If you really are interested in living your life as a woman you would want to do age appropriate things that women rather than anime characters and little girls normally do.  Notice it's always autogynephiles that have the girlhood obsession, not HSTS."

AGPs, incels, femcels, nazis, antifa, isis, you name it! If you're a low value loser there are tons of communities that'll take you in. So your thesis could be about that, but if you brand it as a trans thing then you'll get the fury of academia unloaded on you."

The zealots now wield so much power that It's borderline illegal to acknowledge that men and women are different and that gender is a biological reality. You can not compare that to Satanic panic nonsense, or even something like Columbine, which was a flash in the pan.

And, okay, I'll admit I wasn't alive in the 70's or coherent for most of the 80's, but were people ever being fired from their careers for listening to music that Christian fundamentalist groups didn't like?

2393,">I mean, people were getting murdered for being black on college campuses at one point. You think it's worse today?

Yes, but well before my own lived-experience. I'm referring to very recent history, as I mentioned, and I do think it has gotten significantly worse over the past 20-30 years.

ETA: Oh, and one time when I was walking at night some dudes pulled up right next to the sidewalk and tried to pull me into their car. Were they just trying to scare me or actually trying to abduct me? I'm not sure, but either way I screamed bloody murder and ran away and made a police report (which of course amounted to nothing).

I’ve been kidnapped, for real. A changing room stalking and kidnapping isn’t exhibitionism! Like, what the fuck you nasty rapists. Exhibitionism occurs in a space where everyone consents to the exhibition. Public displays of sexual behavior where everyone doesn’t consent to your sexual activities is sexual assault. I don’t know what female woman would try to be seen changing in a clothing store, sounds like something a male woman would do, but if a female woman did do that, she would be a sexual offender. Why does this prick assume we don’t have exhibition fetishes, when this post isn’t about exhibition whatsoever?

1: Have whatever behavior and interests you want! I wasn't very feminine, although I know a lot of my peers who were. Being a ""girl"" doesn't force you into any behavior or personality type, that would be horribly misogynistic.

2: Have two ovaries and a uterus."

Becoming female will magically fix all of these issues because girls are always pretty, happy, and perky.  . 

This is what happens when men don’t have female friends or family they’re really close with. They get their information on what women are from media like anime and movies, which of course we all know is shockingly inaccurate. They don’t see women as humans with the same issues as men, they see us as something wholly different. He’s been brainwashed.

His language is just so telling. As if being female makes you exempt from these human issues. It really highlights how they are just men with severe issues that they think women don’t have to suffer through and therefore becoming a woman will fix all their problems. 

It’s delusional and sexist. We’re not human to them. We’re an idea."

Drag queens do it. Most do it poorly but on occasion a drag queen actually gets it right. 


So men can ‘act’ like women all they want. That is definitely possible. That’s not my issue. 
My issue is when they say they “are” women. That they are actually physically female. Which is of course impossible. 

Saying you  are a woman when your sex is actually male falls under  speech (i guess). Same free speech gives me the right to still call them men. Same right of speech gives me the right to still call him Dave instead of “Stacey”. 

My issue with these men starts when they decide it isnt an act but a reality. When they decide they are now entitled to things intended for biological women (pads without Venus symbols, gynecologists, change rooms, rape shelters). 

The issue is not that they act like women. But that they demand to be treated as though they are biologically female."

I mean, wouldn’t it just be easier to fix each stuff as a man? Probably, but how could they chose the “woman is a feeing” hill to die on then. 

I have said it before and I will say it again: they are taking the wrong kind of hormones. There is no way those guys are producing enough testosterone for their male bodies to work properly. Lay off the Mountain Dew, dude, have some steak and salad, exercise, get some social classes (like dancing or cooking) to meet people. This is not a healthy approach to fix depression."

2528,"Precisely!

Most drag queens are just loud and obnoxious men in a wig. Some drag queens do a somewhat better job than others, less blatantly stereotypical, less over-the-top-screaming-housmaid awefulness. If they do it semi professionally, more like an actor would than the way a drag queen normally does, then i have a very grudging respect for that. If it is professional, if they know and recognize themselves that it is an act. I was on stage once playing a male, professionally playing and portraying a different sex is hard. I respect those who do it well. But only as long as they realize it is still acting. It is still pretending. They are not and will never be woman. Just the same as me being on stage as a man did not make me male.

&#x200B;

You are correct that i should not have said ""getting it right"", because obviously a man can never  get being a woman right. What i think i meant was that some drag queens do it better and less offensively stereotypical. But you are correct, they do not actually get it right. It is still an act. That is my issue. Sure they can áct like a woman all they like. But they can never be one."

2544,I don’t believe any of those theories. They aren’t based in science. These TIMs have always existed the only difference now is we have TIMs online requiring eggs.

Also autisim has increased a bit and there’s a massive link between autisim and being a TIM or TIF.

2633,"This is a common or garden submission fetish.  Taken out of context and minus the ‘peak trans’ shit, it has fuck all to do with gender identity and is neither uniquely M or F. Anyone can fantasize about a bunch of dicks in their mouth yadayada (or yawn).

What does made me 😤is that in tacking on the trans piece, and in using the image to state that it’s a girl doing the dick sucking, the whole thing becomes a fantasy about being female being the ultimate (titillating) humiliation. Just NO.

2776,These dudes admit it amongst themselves but anyone else who brings it up is automatically labeled a transphobic bigot. Make it make sense.
2777,Why are their memes so weird? it’s not even funny or anything. they’re posting really interpersonal matters and getting false assurance for it.
2778,"What does it mean to be a woman “intellectually” and “emotionally”? It means being an idiot who cries 3 times a day and can’t do basic arithmetic, doesn’t it?"

2781,These things just make the worst memes I've ever seen. It's altogether just sad really.
2782,Lowkey it bothers me how they use a female avatar for this. It’s as if the person who made the comic is doing subtle things to convince the fetishist that they actually are a woman
2783,"This is intersting ""narrative"". The first 3 comments are about *being/not being appealed becoming a girl* somehow. But the last comment suggests suddenly *having dysphoria*. Yes, it follows just the AGP theory: the dysphoria is secondary cause by the paraphilia."

2794,"The memes are part virtue signaling, part propaganda. And the point isn't to be relatable in a funny way, it's to be relatable in a way that undermines the self-image and self-confidence of insecure young men."

2799,"When i was younger i used to get along with women waaaay better than men, and i related to them more on an emotional/intellectual level. I think i matured a bit faster and women seemed more stable than men when i was a kid/teen. I could have deep, emotional, intelligent conversations with female friends while my male friends were mostly wanting to party, fuck, act macho, and generally bro out.

Now that we've all grown up and matured i actually have more male friends than women, but when i was younger i absolutely related to women ""emotionally and intellectually.""

Likely not where this dude is coming from, but i figured i'd toss in a different perspective. And no, i never felt any ""dysphoria"" or thought i was a woman deep down. I love being a man and always have. I just liked being around women and could relate to them more when i was younger. Women seemed like normal people while men were bombastic and boisterous."

2803,"emotionally??😬😬

2804,"Honestly, I wouldn't put it past some of them."
2805,"Exactly, and also it's not even a female- it's an animated female cartoon. It's much easier to relate to a girlish archetype with drawn features than to a live action woman. I feel like men are just ridiculously naïve, they feel because the media portrays *them* accurately, it also portrays women accurately, which they *truly* believe somehow is representative of a female personality."
2806,"A man having sexual thoughts about being a woman is literally definition of autogynephilia, which is a fetish."
2807,Maybe theres a reason
2808,This... is entirely true and deserves to be its own post on GC or something.
2809,"ikr i once at work (am server) got yelled at by a customer bc they commented that they were sure i was an egg, i asked what it was and they told me, to which i denied their claim saying that life wasnt for me. they then yelled at me for being internally oppressed and to “just be the girl you are already”"

2812,"I checked it out and seems like just people with self-harm issues vibing, a sticky says that they banned posts encouraging/glorifying self-harm."
2813,"I don't think that's what the meme is referring to, it just means that this person has preconceptions about what female sexuality is like, along with emotions, and intellect, and thinks he fits them, that's all."

2823,"Cute, HAH. Yeah no."
2824,"Not a girlfriend, and also not cute"
2825,It’s a really sad state of affairs where there are actually horny young men or teen boys who aren’t having sex being groomed by AGP trans to believe that they are eggs and then these poor fools embark on life changing body modification to try to be a ‘desired cute girl’.

2838,"i'm new here and want to ask some questions based on you all's perspectives lol. First of all, are you all against ALL trans or just those who are displaying signs of autogynephilia? Based on the responses I get, I'd like to ask some more. I spent LOADS of time studying trans issues back in 2015-2018 (watching hundreds of videos, reading alot of books, articles, and studies, etc) and can say that I have a grasp on what's going on but i'm open to different perspectives. From my perspective, it seems there is no one true ""trans"" person, which is prevalent in pretty much everything in life. People have different reasons they transition, have different perspectives of gender (which can influence gender identity and gender expression), have different resources that are available to them (which can influence how well someone can transition, how early they can transition, if they are even aware of where they even are on the gender/sexuality spectrum, etc), have different factors that contribute to the basis of their gender, etc... I remember first discovering the term ""autogynephilia"" through a Youtuber name ""Rod Fleming"". The guy is pretty much open about dating transwomen (particularly, asian ladyboys).. he had a video series some years ago explaining the differences between HSTS and AGPs. You guys should check it out.

I think the real problem here is how the west puts women on a pedestal and then tells men, ""and you'd better go get one or else you're a complete fucking loser and deserve to rot and die. Current estimates are that roughly half the population is introverted- which is to say they don't find large social gatherings enjoyable, not that they're antisocial- and within that population there is absolutely people who just are not- or at least not yet- ready for serious relationships.

On the other hand, incels are some of the most vile and toxic people I've ever encountered. They idolize rapists and spree murderers, help each other to prey on women, and worse. There have been incels who help other men to rape high school girls by telling them how to hang out outside the HS and not seem threatening. There have been incels who talk lovingly about dissecting women and fucking the body, but in far worse language.

As far as I'm concerned, anyone far gone enough to fall into incel circles is dead to me and to society."

2852,"I, personally am not against all trans people. But the current movement that is going on encourages those who are predatory to abuse the system for their own benefit. Are some of these people legitimately dysphoric? Maybe, but I know for sure many are not and just want to become trans for their own fucked up desires (fetishes, victim complex, oppression points, etc). These predators are not just harmful to bio women they are also harmful to the trans community (because most have a trans fetish). And yes, this does mean that I'm okay with trans women who are passing--but my definition of passing isnt how feminine someone looks, it's about how aware they are of women's rights (bio and trans, and what makes the rights of each different as well). But, trans women should definitely not have a say in women's rights as they will never have the full experience of being a woman.
I dont mind talking about this in DMs if you wish because I'm always open to learning others POV and finding a middle ground where everyone can benefit."
2853,Both HSTS and AGPs are men. They are not and will never be women.
2854,"We are not ""against"" trans people, we are against the idea that men who wish to be women, for whatever reason, are completely identical to women and must be treated identically. This endangers women, since we must share showers, prisons, changing rooms etc with ANY dude who wants to get in, so we have no protection from predators. It also means we cannot name the real for female oppression - our reproductive organs - without triggering or excluding men who deserve to be excluded. Men can pretend to be women to steal our scholarships and job opportunities in STEM since they have benefited from male privilege and been encourage to work in STEM their whole lives, and they cannot get pregnant so employers won't have to pay maternity leave. Plus misogynists will happily hire fake women who count towards their equality statistics when they wouldn't hire real women.

Do you see how trying to be nice to ""real"" trans women, however you define that, leaves all women and girls vulnerable to predators like Jessica Yaniv and Karen White? Isn't it suspicious that so many trans women refuse to have their own spaces safe from men, they demand to share ours?"

2861,"Trans people go out of their way to recruit autistic men who are naturally less romantically gifted.

People who are not romantically successful generally have extreme degenerate sexual preferences, often climaxing into deluding themselves into thinking they’re trans. 

Spend 5 minutes on /r9k/ and you will be bombed by pages and pages of transsexual propaganda targeting incels."
2862,"It has a lot more to do with androgenic hormones than it does society telling us to do something, how society depicts male sexuality is just a reflection of what is already occurring.  It's like saying that dogs bark because society depicts them as barking... while society does indeed do this it isn't the *cause* of the behavior.  I assure you that young men in Victorian England wanted sex just as badly if not more than men today."
2863,"> Current estimates are that roughly half the population is introverted

What does that have to do with anything? Introverts absolutely make connections and find relationships, especially ones that are aware of their introversion. It make take a little more work for an introvert, but picking random people up at a bar generally doesn't yield successful relationships anyway."
2864,"Women deal with all manner of oppression in western countries, so the 'pedestal' comment shows that you have no idea what women's real lives are like. 

It's unfortunate that certain men believe that they're complete losers without a girlfriend, but it's up to them to form an identity that they're comfortable with. Women always have to find a way of making themselves at least reasonably comfortable in society because we're never pretty enough, nice enough, whatever enough for patriarchal standards. Men can do the same thing. Maybe men should be kinder to each other, support each other in ways that allow other men to develop healthy psyches so they can have good relationships with women. Short of that, there's therapy.

If the guys you're talking about aren't 'ready' for serious relationships, and they're not having 'serious' relationships there's no issue. 

No lack of female attention makes any man who's not already mentally ill in some way decide that he's 'really' a woman. Men who believe they're women are delusional; this has nothing to do with the behavior of women in general society and has everything to do with some neurological or psychological misfiring in the guy's brain."
2865,"Yeah Incels as in capital I Incels that have hate for women are terrible, I was referring to the men / teen males that who are not receiving mutual female attention who then wander into areas where they are preyed on by transwomen and told that they are transwomen.

Yep. It's well known that disorders (whether mental or physical) are on a spectrum..

2873,"I think ""but androgens!"" is a little simplistic. Guys want sex and a great deal of male identity is bound up in finding a sexual partner to start a family with, no matter how much guys want to pretend they're eternal bachelors, but that doesn't explain, as I said above, chemically castrating yourself on the off chance you'll be able to pass for a woman for 10, 15 years before age makes a fool out of you.


There is absolutely something to be said for how aggressively idealized women are in society. It makes perfect sense that when women are repeatedly depicted as happy, cute and living care-free lives that some guys are going to draw the conclusion that they can get a slice of that pie by becoming one. 


...and of course there's still the statistical reality that many transwomen are actually just gay men who were effectively gas lit into it. Being gay was unacceptable but masquerading as a woman was A-OK in their minds. 


...And of course sometimes it's because we're holding children and people who are mentally children to the standard of an idealized adult who is strictly logical. Children crave attention and I've seen more than one case where a son was found to be transgendered only for it to later come out that what was *really* going on was that the family had another child- a girl- and the boy's prepubescent mind came to the conclusion that if he were a girl he'd get the attention his parents were now putting towards his baby sister.


....and of course sometimes it's just the fact that humans are social creatures and fitting in is a real social pressure we all feel at some point in our lives. There's been entire studies that came to the conclusion that some people identify as trans for no reason other than that it grants them very real power over other people and makes them virtually immune to bullying and teachers wouldn't dare fuck with them.  


It's a little too easy to pluck any abnormalities out of a story, dust off the context and hold it up as *the cause* for transgenderism. The great, grand curse of social sciences is that attempts to explain human behavior often leave you with vague generalities because it's exceedingly difficult to explain the entire human experience under simple, narrow focus."
2874,">which is to say they don't find large social gatherings enjoyable, **not that they're antisocial**"
2875,A pedestal can have it's own ball and chain. If you don't think a woman can't walk into a crowd of men and immediately dominate their attention- negative or positive- you're incredibly naive. The only thing a pedestal gives you is more exposure. It's not necessarily negative or positive.
2876,"Kind of answers it though. Look at the downvotes your comment is getting. Maybe if you go through the posts on this sub, you’ll see what everyone here thinks about transgenders.  I used to be inclusive, advocating transgenders as well. But it gets to a certain point where you just sit back and think “why”? HOWEVER, I maybe shouldn’t lump them all into one group. There are  some transgenders who I can stomach, like YouTuber blaire white, who I find infinitely less repulsive than other transgenders. The group seems to have an inability to THINK. They have this inability to stay  out of places where no one wants them. or have really creepy and borderline rape like mindsets. but again, I cannot generalize them all, this will then justify people generalizing gay people or people of color or men.

EDIT:

>Being gay was unacceptable but masquerading as a woman was A-OK in their minds.

I don't think anyone perceives transgenderism as more socially acceptable than homosexuality.  It's hard to think of anything in media/socially that would lead them to believe this.  Concerning this Blanchard typological group, transgenderism is a heightened or less restrained form of their expressions of femininity.  It's more, not less."

You'd be surprised. The most blatant example is Iran where ""sex reassignment"" is openly and legally regarded as a ""cure"" for homosexuality. Turns out those old religious texts that instruct people to kill homosexuals don't have near as much to say about ""transgender"" individuals. Makes for a convenient out for religious fundamentalists that don't want to displease their god but also don't want to stone their gay or lesbian family members to death."
2888,">I don't think anyone perceives transgenderism as more socially acceptable than homosexuality.


It's become a statistically relevant portion of the trans community- men who just discover later in life that they're gay. 


And it's less about external acceptance and more about resolving internal inconsistencies. These men find themselves attracted to men, but are 100% certain they're not gay. The internet tells them it sounds like they might be transgendered. This makes sense because they realize they're not men attracted to men but instead a woman trapped in a man's body who's actually straight."

2933,"No it's not like that at all, more or less talk about how you are still a woman even if biologically male is more so a way to cope than anything else. Trans people may still opt for surgery but some try to stay comfortable with the body they were born with due to complications such as money issues, attitudes of family and peers, or any other valid reason people can have for not outwardly transitioning or not taking steps to receive surgeries or hormones. For many state funded surgeries and such would help out tremendously due to shitty American healthcare (assuming you're from the states) learning the mannerisms of the other sex can also help you pass better. Do you also act this way towards actors and writers who people study? While I understand that those are definitely not the same thing and only somewhat comparable I think it gets my point across.
 
Women aren't some hallow character, that's correct but no one is claiming or acting like they are. While being a woman is more complex than that so is being trans. It's not just ""men with a fetish"" you completely ignore that these people are also complex with their own complex issues. While there are bad people in every group often times a majority of trans people disavow them, trans people just want to live their lives like how you live yours they just also want to take steps to be seen as the gender they identify as.
 
What I want to know is why care what others identify as? Who cares? While women have there own complex issues that deserve to be addressed that isn't an argument against dismantling preconceived ideas of sex and it's relation to gender, we don't really have anything to lose by having loser definitions of gender. Along with that men aren't all that bad, most men aren't, again every group has its own bad apples. At the end of the day neither of us are doing anything that's going to change the world were just losers going on Reddit. Sorry if my writing was a clusterfuck I tend to ramble."

Many TiMs I've spoken to seem to have some concept of being a woman as ""living life on easy mode."" As a guy, I cannot convince them otherwise because I am not a woman -- they fail to see the hypocrisy in this belief. Coming from an actual woman, this is a valid criticism, but you'd have to be blind to think somehow being a woman in Western Society is easy mode.

I think that agp can be related to  the maternal deprivation. Zucker and Langstrom in their epidemiological study of transvestism found that transvestism is related to early separation from parents.  Also there is evidence  from animal studies  that maternal deprivation  sensitizes dopaminergic system and it can facilitate attachment to random objects. There is Marshall's theory of paraphilias based on  the attachment theory.

I go against my ethics, common sense and Hippocratic Oath constantly with TiMs. It's humiliating: I'm a glorified rx machine. Comply with their insane demands or commit career suicide.

\> And for the cosmetic surgeons, making a nice chunk of change for turning a penis inside out, seems like a pretty good motivator to me.

You're spot on. I have nothing but respect for our scalpel jockies but they're not the type to turn down easy cash for ethical reasons. Surgeons are a breed of their own. 

\> ""but doctors recommend transitioning as treatment for gender dysphoria""

This is not a lie, but it's extremely misleading. A more accurate way of looking at it is: ""doctors are bullied into recommending whatever the hell placates TiM patients sufficiently to avoid being sued/fired."" I could tell you what I personally consider the best treatment if you're curious, but a tl;dr would be I am the absolute last resort after all other options have been exhausted.

But none of that explains why I want to be a woman or at least have a female's body. I can't be a woman. I am me. My personality has no specific one and I lean masculine.

A friend was part of a leftist org based in an American east coast city. Most of the men would go into the org, which was Third Worldist, as cis white males aka the worst, and within a few weeks or a month or two come out as trans. There was just this pipeline of trans members discovering the new white dude is actually trans, and shockingly, no longer the worst, but one of the oppressed.

She bumped into one or two around the city after they'd left the org. No longer trans, and they explictly said they felt a great amount of pressure to question their gender and on top of that to experiment, with the paradox that once you are doing that you're by definition part of it. They knew it wasn't them and left the org entirely rather than be framed as having gone back in the closet etc.

-How do you think gender dysphoria differs from the experience of body dysmorphia, if at all? I have BD, and have noticed parallels between it and GD, but BD involves more checking myself in the mirror to obsess over the flaws, while I’d imagine GD might involve less OCD-ish checking behaviors?

-Does your GD ebb and flow in intensity? Is it triggered by anything in particular?

-Do you think your GD is related to the way gender has been socially constructed? IE, if men were socially sanctioned to engage in “feminine” pursuits, would your dysphoria be affected? 

-is “gender euphoria” a thing (as opposed to AGP euphoria?)

-Is therapy helping you at all? Did the estradiol help at all? Are you opposed to taking psychiatric drugs in general? If not, have they helped?

Thanks so much for being willing to answer questions, and feel free to ignore any/all of mine. I just find GD really interesting, and wish I could understand it better. I hope you can figure out how to manage yours and find self-acceptance."

3077,"First off, sorry for the long post here. This reminded me of my senior year writing papers for hours on end, I miss that.

Some background, I'm a 20 y/o natural born male struggling with gender dysphoria.

1.) I don't really think there's a big difference. I also just look at myself in the mirror and obsess over things I wish I could change. I think the major difference would be that GD *ALSO* focuses on genitals where BD might/likely focus more on aspects like a flabby stomach or a double chin (although it is different for everyone) I'll often be laying there or walking around and be reminded of my penis and get that general feeling of unease that is dysphoria. At times I'll audibly make a noise of and/or grab myself in a gesture of frustration.

2.) I wouldn't say anything really triggers the bad feelings, it's more like a mild pain or a toothache. If I'm preoccupied then I don't really notice, but the thoughts undoubtedly creep in if there's nothing else (work mostly) going on. But you're constantly thinking about it when out in public, just wishing you could be anybody else other than yourself.

3.) This is a loaded topic but here's my two cents. 

\*I personally believe that (especially for younger people) these ""constructs"" can cause a type of dysphoria. Lets say a male child likes playing with dolls, or wants to wear dresses or grow his hair out. If parents or teachers say that that's something only a girl does, then that child will feel more inclined to identify as a girl, and will then feel uncomfortable when partaking in those activities as it's something that has been engrained in him as socially taboo. In reality, none of these things should be treated as gendered, and they should let their child come to their own conclusions. There's nothing wrong with boys playing with dolls or having long hair or even wearing a dress, unless we tell them that it's wrong. They are just things, and we are just humans. Does that make sense?

\*I like swords, dancing, star wars, history and long pants. There is nothing inherently gendered about these items and there shouldn't be. They are things and I am me, that is the way it should be for all things.

4.) On the topic of gender specifically, I haven't experienced ""gender euphoria"". I would say it's more like an ebb and flow of *content* and *malcontent*. Sometimes you don't think about it and you feel good about yourself and where you are in life, while other times... Really there is no better way to say it. I would assume it's similar to BD. 

\*Really for me, all there is is envy and longing for a vagina, and I don't think that unless I magically get one I'll have any form of euphoria any time soon regarding gender in any way.

\*And autogynophilia is honestly kind of gross, and makes a mockery of the people tha actually have dysphoria. AGP is most commonly read into as a fetish and I honestly believe it should be treated as such. If putting on a certain pair of underwear gets your rocks off then fine, just leave it in the bedroom and don't claim to have a crippling mental disorder to ""fit in"". (I realize that in saying this, some people will feel excluded or targeted or triggered. Sorry but that's just my view and I don't believe it will change. In all my years I've never been turned on for dressing in a way that made me feel more comforatble. Learn to accept/push past your fetish to figure out whether or not that's all it is or if it's something more, only then come forward with claims of mental illness, otherwise you will look a mockery. Just look at most of the posts on this subreddit.)

5.) Therapy is nice in that it gives me a place to go and a person to talk to; a person I can trust to hash out these tough topics. I don't really have any friends or anyone to talk to so it's really nice to have a person to go to; it also helps with depression. Though I don't think it helps with dysphoria. I think the only thing that could help with that right now is passing as a female/just getting a vagina (even though that option is years and many many drugs away). That's a big reason I'm still in this boat, as I see no real other way out.

\*As soon as I started taking Estrodial I had second thoughts. The Idea that there could be irreversable damage done to my body hit a lot harder when I was actually taking the pills. The danger of **sterility, possible surgery to remove breast growth, and the irreversable effects of bottom surgery** (I've heard of people who wanted to go back after getting bottom surgery. I couldn't imagine...) 

\*I'm not against drugs, they can do wonderful things for some people. While I personally have qualms with drugs because of some poor choices I made some years back, I'd rather not take any unless I have to. I do take Abilify to help with sleep though.

3096,WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.
3097,These days there are doctors and psychiatrists that will falsely say you’re dysphoric. Heard the story about the 6 year old Boy? His mom is getting all kinds of support and doctors say he has gender dysphoria even though not showing the signs. It’s very obvious his mom forces him but yet everything was in favor of the mom. What’s happening guys

3101,"How do you manage to have to children that get into the trans game, for being so rare I feel like a lot has to do with socialization more than anything"
3102,This is why it’s predatory when this stuff is targeted as ‘hip’ to kids.
3103,"Right? I have seen that sentiment several times before, and I don't know where people are getting this from.  I don't know of any woman, including myself, who fantasizes about their own body. Wtf? Is this idea coming from porn or something?  I am dumbfounded that doctors told him this."
3104,"Can't remember who it was, but there's a famous male author who wrote an ""erotic"" passage about a woman masturbating thinking of herself and was shocked when he was told women don't do this. It's an inability to understand other people might have different feelings about the same stimulus - they assume if looking at a naked woman makes them horny then looking at herself will also make the woman horny."
3105,"The huge problem about that is that celeb females will objectifiy themselves then call it ""being sexual"", and then libfems moans about how women are ""punished for being sexual"".  


I hence disagree that it's never the case that women conflate being objectified with being a sexual person. In fact, the entire western culture does so."
3106,Men. Misogynistic men.
3107,"They probably picture a porn actress caressing her naked body in front of the mirror. 

Because they are not women, they can't understand that that fact that all of us are trained to have an inner voyeur sexualizing our bodies at all times is not fun or sexy. Feminity is sexualized to such extent that we learn to put on masks of shallowness to look pretty for others since we are young girls.

It takes us years of fighting to liberate ourselves from fetichizating the flesh we inhabit, and these fucking clowns want to use it as an excuse to say they're women??? Not on my watch."
3108,"> I don’t understand this lie that women also fantasize about our own bodies and find it arousing. This isn’t true. At all. It is a complete falsehood that misunderstands female sexuality, healthy sexuality at all, female socialization, etc etc. 

1000% this. I don’t even appear in my own fantasies, much less turn myself on. Looking in a mirror is basically me just categorizing things I want to fix."
3109,"100% that is exactly what they are. There are now online clinics offering hormones no questions asked, no doctors note needed and this is all apparently legal."
3110,">Just money-making schemes designed as medicine


One moment, I need to contact a few doctors I know and find some recent psychiatry grads with questionable morals about a practice idea. Once you create a core group and first practice run by people in on the scheme, you can easily open up branches or other places populated by people who actually buy into it and believe in that shit, just don’t ever promote them up to the board or C-class positions. It’s predatory and lucrative but the media will love you for your championing of trans rights.

However, I don’t think even my shriveled and weak sense of ethics could tolerate destroying the lives of impressionable kids, so maybe I won’t do that."
3111,"> I'm starting to suspect that a lot of these new ""gender clinics"" that are opening at large hospitals are really just money-making schemes disguised as medicine. There's a lot of money to be made in the transexual industry.

I dated a girl who worked at a clinic where they were in the business of lopping off dicks. My perception was that it was just a procedure like any other, as far as they were concerned. They did botox, breast implants, bottom surgeries, etc."
3112,"Yup. I basically posted the same sentiments on this sub like a month ago talking about how these clinics HAVE TO BE working for quotas and some lurker tried to call me out.

There was a post a couple of weeks ago where a former TIM talked about the dangers and lies behind transitioning and all the responses were talking about how *he* was the one with the problem🤦🏼‍♀️"

3120,"I’ve told transgender activists for a while now that their propaganda is confusing millions of teenagers going through puberty and experiencing unusual, but passing, feelings into thinking those feelings mean something they don’t.

The activists don’t care. In fact, they seem to welcome it as a method to recruit more into their ranks."
3121,"The gender unicorn is ~“taught”~ groomed into *children* as young *as five*.  They’re teaching literal children shit like, “boys can have periods too”. I don’t know why city councils are hearing out actual pedos such as JY and not throwing them into prison(FFS the man still has a Twitter!). 

I really fear for this generation of children"
3122,I don’t know a single trans kid who was targeted or pushed to be trans. I’m sure it happens but those cases are not the majority of trans kids
3123,"In fact, I think a lot of us actually feel the opposite way.  We don't want to think about our bodies at that level of detail.  All our own body parts seem too fat or too thin or too dark or too light or too covered in stretch marks or whatever.  Even though we'd never be so judgemental of anyone else.  It's sad that we feel this way.  But obviously we aren't going to get turned on by looking at ourselves."
3124,It sounds like someone who skipped a major development hurdle.
3125,"I’m sorry, I think I’m being dense, but I can’t understand your last paragraph. I want to, I’m just struggling. Do you mean that when women display our sexuality, libfems misinterpret objectification as liberation and sex positivity?"
3126,this comment is everything!
3127,People need to stop blindly trusting that all doctors/hospitals/clinics are primarily motivated by pure empathy for patients.
3128,The new pill mills are for hormones

3131,"Radical feminists noticed something rotten over 50 years ago. Nobody listens to women, as usual. ""Right wingers"" cannot claim shit."
3132,The modern school system was created for young boys in mind. Most high school and university professors are male. The idea that girls are treated preferentially just for having groups of older women tutoring and mentoring them is ridiculous. Maybe society would be better off with sex-segregated schools.

3139,"I mean... to be fair, I turn myself on a fair bit. Then again, I'm a lesbian... and I'm exactly my type (androgynous/GNC)... and I'm fairly smokin hot. It stabs me right in the heart to learn about how other women generally view their bodies. The female form is absolutely gorgeous, being socialized into shame and disgust over our own is just sickening and I count my lucky stars I was able to avoid that."
3140,"I don't believe women in the west ever display ""our sexuality"" truly. What I see is women catering to the male gaze and call it ""being a sexual woman"".

I believe this trope makes it very ""normal"" for MTT to think female sexuality is tied with sexy pornified looks.

Kill me but I'm not that entirely sure that we are all able to make a huge nuance between ""being sexy for men"", and ""being sexual"".

Female sexuality is typically performative on looks, and how desirable she feels or is. Orgasms and clit stim  are something women fight amongst eachother  as ""necessary"" for ""good sex""."
3141,"Also, please never say ""you're being dense"". Just ask  to develope better ;)"
3142,"With reps using webcams to ""diagnose"" them and prescribe them. Truly horrifying."
3143,Those go hand-in-hand with anti-depressants/anti-anxiety prescriptions
3144,"The transtrender movement was only getting started when I was in grad school for CS, but even then it was pretty obvious that there was some combination of social ostracism growing up (multiple causes... autism spectrum issues, conventional high intelligence mixed with social awkwardness, and/or physical issues like small stature, acne, hygiene) and social fixations common in common CS-aligned subcultures (like anime) that seemed highly correlated with trans alignment, at least among CS students."
3145,Does that stand for counseling studies?
3146,You could say get them dancing at gay bars for singles?
3147,"The more people that join the cult, the more sway they have.

Sad that they prey on the vulnerable and socially isolated (just like any other cult)"
3148,"That's really a great point.  And the flip side is also true.  Why would a guy get turned on by the though of himself as a woman?  The female version of himself (the real version, not his teeny bopper cat girl fantasy) would resemble a sister or other close relative.  Can you say incest?  That's both disgusting and evolutionarily counter productive.

ETA:. Remember that Narcissus's obsession and behavior meant he left behind no offspring.  As it should be, from an evolutionary perspective.  And without modern medicine, a TIM today would have the exact same results."
3149,How can a man look at another man and say I want to fuck that asshole or a woman look at another woman and say I want to lick that snatch? That also makes no evolutionary sense.
3150,"Yeah, agreed. This is why Beyoncé’s brand of feminism is obnoxious af, and Emma Watson was so close to the point when she critiqued her. I was disappointed but not surprised when people jumped all over her, and now she’s this feminist icon. Women can’t be feminist icons, it seems, without displaying our bodies for men to consume."
3151,"You’re right. Women have this thing called “feeling sexy” when they know they look good and men are checking them out. Men have no equivalent. I heard it referred to as Object of Desire Self-Consciousness Theory, which is a mouthful."
3152,"That's why it bugs me. I'm not far from the stereotypical computer science person(I get social anxiety just from reading twitter), but watching anime, being a shutin, and having poor social skills does not make you a woman. It's like hmm, so you enjoy programming, math, video games, anime, in other words things overwhelmingly enjoyed by men, not women. Guess you're deep down a female? The atmosphere doesn't help today where anyone can see retarded memes like thigh-highs being called programming socks, and mtfs pushing this idea that somehow being trans means you're 150 IQ and better than those dumby regular males, it's cringe as hell. That's not strawmanning, though we all know that the trans population is a very, very loud minority. I try to live and let live, but I can't help but observe these things"

3157,"I agree too, but no decent alternatives have been offered yet between mother and whore, so let""s wait."
3158,Lol
3159,Why is it inappropriate?
3160,"Because drag queens are men with a fetish, and they should not be using children to act out that fetish."
3161,"You realize drag is a comedy act/art show right? Have you seen an episode of RuPaul's drag race? Fucking kid's movies make jokes about drag all the time. You might be confusing them with trans people but there's no proof of that either.

Proof it's a fetish?

Why shouldn't they be using children? Do you think they're gonna rape the kids or something?"
3162,"Ugh the comments. ""You shouldn't shame her for dressing revealingly, she's just living the teenage years she never got"". I'm sorry but most teenagers do not wear fishnet stockings and 6 inch heels. He's not a teenager he's a fully grown male. He's wearing it because it's sexual that's it."
3163,"It is still a fetish, he has just gotten emboldened by the current TRA rhetoric and has now chosen to enact his fetish during everyday life. I feel so bad for that poor child. 

I'm not even going to look at the original post because I'm almost positive the verdict will be YTA....shame..."
3164,Came here to post this. So glad to see it's already here. This was incredibly agonizing to read. The way the post just casually talks about this grown male adult with all these strangely male traits. It's almost like it's just a dude who has a sexual fetish and is for some reason publicly flaunting it. The fact that it started out with the wife stating that the dude specifically told her it was a fetish is just so priceless.
3165,This is what it looks like when you choose your fetish over your child because you're a weird deranged piece of shit.
3166,"Ew. Fuck these men and their fetishes. Poor woman spent her youth on this sick dude, and now doesn’t even get to grieve or be concerned for herself and her son because of political correctness. Fuck this guy so much."
3167,"remember when men would just walk out on their wives to live their ""pimp lives"" and ""be free"" instead of embarrassing and scarring their kids by dressing up as rupaul"
3168,"omg the comments are disgusting...

""I see this happen to almost every transwoman I've ever met. Shortly after they begin to transition they dress like a 12 year old's interpretation of what's sexy. They spent all their lives basically learning feminine expressions of sexuality from the male pov. Plus they want to experiment with anything they couldn't get away with as a man. She's going through this phase.""

ALMOST. al-fucking-most got it. They will never be women."
3169,"Poor kid, the media would say this is a case of ""Internalized Transphobia"""
3170,Omfggggg this is horrible. This poor woman and her poor kid. That man should not have any custody of his kid. He’s clearly sick and a fucking asshole.
3171,"Imagine sitting in public feeling the need to Stan for a dude who loves fishnets and panties more than their child and won't meet their child where they're at just for woke points. When actual women dress in fishnets and mini skits and tube tops in public, THERE IS JUDGEMENT. If you're actually a woman, grab some mom jeans and a sweatshirt and some chapstick...If only every mother were allowed a second adolescence without consequence."
3172,"Why must he get to relive his teenage years? They passed long ago. For every adult, no matter what they regret about their younger years, those years are gone. It's harmful to stress yourself about something you can't undo. So even if this isn't just sexual, why go down that road? Why encourage someone else to the detriment of their son?"

3174,"I feel so bad for OP. I was just thinking how terrible that subreddit is for women yesterday after a woman got DOGPILED for saying she wanted her husband to shower before sex. I mean seriously, HUNDREDS of comments saying she was neurotic and manipulative. This is like catnip for misogynists. Women should seriously find a supportive ear to listen and help them and not be thrown to the reddit dogs like that."
3175,"I was banned for 14 days from AITA straight after commenting on it. I basically said everyone was shitty since the mother wasn´t doing enough to protect her son from ""Laura"" who´s very mentally ill and has a straight up fetish (that he admits himself). I seriously didn´t think I was going over the line because the situation seemed dramatic.  Most of the comments just revolved around the TIM feeling like a teenage girl (they obviously dress like hookers now... wtf?) and that if he just changed his clothing when picking up the 10 year old from school everything would be okay. This post was truly messed up but the comments were worse. I worry for that child."
3176,"As disturbing as this is, it struck a cord with me. My brother is a TIM. He's started to dress just as ridiculously in my parents' home (where he still lives), and I dread when he starts doing it in public. Last time I was there I was simply horrified that he thought it was OK.

&#x200B;

I really pity her son. Just wow - unfortunately political correctness has really just got too far."
3177,Gee I wonder why so many young boys are getting drawn to far right politics gee I wonder what it could beee.
3178,I looked at the post. Everyone basically took the mom’s side. I’ve seen situations like this a lot. Apparently trans people get some sort of kick or thrill completely embarrassing their closest friends or family.
3179,"Adult males do NOT get to have ""teenage girl phases"" in any way what so ever. They shouldnt date them, they shouldnt look at them, and they certainly shouldnt try to be them.

3185,"The woke girls verbally abusing her for this are the worst...ugh. Of course, mentally ill TIMs are going to act out this way when they receive this kind of encouragement."
3186,"This is so, so disturbing. If he wants to dress like that in private, fine, whatever. It’s still disgusting and misogynistic but whatever. But to dress this way around your young son, who you know is getting bullied, is so cruel, selfish, perverted, and disturbing. I don’t know why I’m so surprised though, these men are the *definition* of selfish, cruel, and perverted. How can you do that to your own son? And the EXCUSE of this being him “living out his stolen teenager years” is NONSENSE. It’s total NONSENSE."

3188,"Jesus christ. I hope this mother gets full custody and a restraining order from this creepy fuck. Imagine picking up your kid from school as a 6'4"" man in a micro mini skirt, fishnet stockings, and heels.... go fuck crackheads for money instead and leave your poor kid alone"
3189,That poor kid. Her mother should ask for divorce and full custody since the child is suffering at school because of his irresponsible father.
3190,The clothing choices you described don’t sound appropriate for ANY parent of a young child especially if that parent is also dressing this way around their kid’s peers ! A cis woman would be wrong for wearing this stuff too. And if this person is trying to re-live the teenage life they never had then they have a sick view of what teenage girls are really like.
3191,"I really don't care how much like a sex clown they want to dress in public, but if your son is getting bullied over it, a sane or caring person would save the fishnets and corset for going to the pub."

3193,jesus that poor child.
3194,"Crossdressing can be perfectly normal if you act like a normal human being, FFS most people are too focused on theirselves to notice and it is more accepted.

If you dont dress like a show no-one will treat you like on. JSYK there are normal crossdressers out there, just very few sane ones who dont dress like a fucking drag queen, or a highschool anime girl.

When I crossdress I look and act just like the person I am. When I crossdress I still refer to myself by name and I still expect or hope to be referred to as a male. Trying to be someone else flies directly in the face of what it's all about. These people ruin it for all of us.

It is ment to be a form of self expression, not whatever the hell these weirdos are doing. FFS it seems like I'm the only sane crossdresser these days. It's the entire reason why I dont interact with the LGBT community in any form whatsoever."
3195,Reminds me of the famous TIM comedian that killed themselves last week leaving a small daughter behind. These TIMs care nothing about their families. Only about the 24/7 fetish. The comedian TIM didn’t pass. The fetish couldn’t be fulfilled to his liking so he offed himself. He was probably jealous of his own little daughter too.

3200,"Marrying or forming relations with a ""traditional masculine guy"" often leads to a road of abuse, so I'm not surprised at all. These guys are traps for insecure heterosexual women who just want to fit in. And the relationship always either ends, ends up in abuse, and more recently, ends up like this. Nothing new to see here. These types of men are incredibly repressed and end up fetishizing the taboo they were told to keep far, far away from (in this case, femininity). These types of men always need to pick themselves up and shake themselves off and constantly fear being seen as ""less than a man"", and pick on those men who have enough confidence to express the full range of their personality. They usually pick up the most frail, fragile, submissive and feminine women with extreme stockholm syndrome, and build toxic, imbalanced and dysfunctional environments for the children they usually end up bringing into this world. True balance can only be achieved when both elements of each individual are in balance, only then can you seek fulfilment through the doubling of positive/negative energies with another being."
3201,Definitely not the arsehole.
3202,That poor kid is likely gonna need a lot of therapy to work through this shit. Kids need parents who do not put their own wants over the needs of their children.
3203,"It's okay, ladies. As long as this freak gets all the attention and the focus doesn't shift from his fetish it's okay. It doesn't matter about traumatising his son, or abusing his ex wife, as long as he can wank off to himself and the validation he gets from handmaidens and other freaks."
3204,"Oh my god. This poor woman and her son. I’d stop custody, I don’t give a fuck. He can take her to court and they will see how he presents himself and I’d hope for the love of god they would put restrictions on clothing or stop the custody altogether or monitor it in them rooms you can go to see your kids in when you don’t have custody anymore. Someone has to do something, this is affecting his child really badly and he couldn’t give a shit. What a cunt."
3205,YTA trans rights are human rights
3206,Right he’s dressing like a prostitute not regular everyday woman.
3207,"Yeah. It's completely nonsense. I am a woman and I never went through such a phase.  I am so sick of hearing this idea that teenage girls are ""ditsy air heads"" obsessed with sexualizing themselves.  No. It's a male porn inspired version of what it is like to be a teen girl.  I was wearing jeans and hoodies throughout my teenage years. In fact, I hated how much attention my breasts would get from creepy old men, so I would purposefully wear baggie clothes to draw less attention to my body.  Teen girls and women who dress like prostitutes are rare. And grown women who dress like prostitutes to their kid's school are even more rare.  I am sick of men trying to gaslight us and I am sick of all of the women who are performing advanced level mental gymnastics in order to accept this line of reasoning."
3208,I know right? Lawl it’s just like being a teenage girl. What kind of fools do they take us for? What kind of fool do you need to be to believe that yourself?
3209,"And there was a post a few months ago on the AITA subreddit where a parent was complaining that their daughter was angry and being misogynistic toward her aunt because the daughter was being bullied after classmates found the aunt in porn. Everyone in the comments on that one were shitting on the parent for expecting their daughter to show the aunt respect, and that the daughter had a right to be angry. But here, a boy is being bullied because his father dresses like a drag queen for regular day to day activities and people are angry that the son is upset for it. Really shows the misogyny huh?"
3210,"Also, we all know with what terms teenage girls who dress in similar fashion are addressed as. If it's an actual girl wearing revealing clothing she's a [insert slur of your choice], yet when it's a 42yo man going through ""second puberty"" it's stunning and brave. Disgusting!"
3211,"Some teenagers do dress provocatively, but are still frowned upon if they do it in inappropriate settings and most parents control what they wear to school, parties, family gatherings and formal occasions. Therefore only grown ass men feel entitled to dress inappropriately in every occasion without any criticism from anyone."

3214,"This really shook me up too, the way these people see teenage girls and girl- and womanhood in general. It is extremely sickening."
3215,"My teenage years consisted of me wearing shirts with cleavage. That was it. That was my big, sexy, dramatic move. Cleavage. 
I have never touched a pair of 6” heels, but I’m pretty sure they don’t scream “confident” so much as they physically strain your feet/legs to make your butt look better.

3220,"I would imagine most people would do their teenage years differently given the chance. Most of us can handle that regret without making an ass out of ourselves, and those who don’t like 40 year old men peacocking and going after women half their age, or older women dressing to show T&A I’d say most of us at the very least think they’re painfully immature."

3224,"> It is still a fetish, he has just gotten emboldened by the current TRA rhetoric and has now chosen to enact his fetish during everyday life. I feel so bad for that poor child.

It's a fetish, but I *also* think there's a lot of crossover with other mental disorders and fetishes.

For instance, I used to date a borderline for a few years. The only thing that made her truly happy was being the center of attention. It didn't matter if the attention was good, or bad. As long as she was getting attention, she was good. But if things got slow, she'd just gravitate towards whatever would generate a bunch of drama.

The other part that I see in this fetish a lot, is **sadism.** They often get a kick out of making things uncomfortable or downright painful for other people.

Put all of these things together, and imagine living a life where you got excited by:

1) making things wildly uncomfortable for the people around you

2) making everything about YOU, 24x7

As you can imagine, that would quickly burn-out everyone in your social circle. And I think that's why you see so many TiMs online whining about how they want a girlfriend, want friends, are lonely, etc... They've burned everyone around them."

My wife and I argue about this one all the time, but here goes:

I went to a Catholic school and I knew *tons* of families where the Dad was gay and the family seemed to be quite functional. 

When I say that, my wife is always horrified, basically thinks that gay men MUST come out of the closet, no ""ifs"", ""ands"", or ""buts.""

I don't know exactly how it went down, but I got the impression that quite a few of my classmates had parents that were religious and got married in their 20s, got a job and started a family... And then at some point it was just super-obvious that Dad was gay.

God I would hope not. This goes for both genders: If you don’t grow up and act like a horny stupid kid well past that age, you’re a failed adult. No one should be allowed to act like that. The fact that it’s encourage in a particular tiny subset of the population is baffling. We judge people that act like that for a reason: It’s not acceptable."
3233,"Because precious white males get to do that, and everyone else has to cater to it.  If we don't cater to it, we will be met with male violence or male emotional abuse (""I'm going to kill myself!"").  

Note in this situation that the woman has to keep her shit together for the sake of the child, whereas the man just does whatever makes him feel good.  The trans movement is about mainly women catering to perverted, sick men so that they can feel sexually satisfied.  And of course, the men don't care if they drag an innocent child into their sex play.  It's gross, pedophilic, and incestuous."

This is giving my flashbacks to before giving up men and I’m like good for fucking her. More women should make their partners shower before head. 


Showering before isn’t that big of fucking deal. Don’t even have to do a full body shower. Just clean the dick. Takes like five minutes maybe less. Just to make the experience of getting sucked better for your all too willing woman!

""Because if it was a man saying he refuses to go down on women because they smell bad and he doesnt trust them to clean well enough, he would be called a misogynist and rightfully so. Vaginas have a smell, it's natural and normal. Trying to prevent any smell is just weird, and promotes all those terrible Summers Eve products that shame women.

So I feel the same way about a penis. If they're an adult, they should have simple hygiene practices that keep most smells at bay. If a man is showering once a day, they dont need to take an extra one just because there may be sweat from a few hours. Theres also sweat on her vagina. So hopefully they're both showering several times a day or she's, dun dun dun, bullshitting. Which is what I'm thinking. ""

That is an idiotic way of thinking and completely ignores how the body works. Not everyone sits in an office all day and any physical job or exercise will heavily increase the strength of your smell.  
  
> just because there may be sweat from a few hours. Theres also sweat on her vagina. So hopefully they're both showering several times a day or she's, dun dun dun, bullshitting. Which is what I'm thinking.

3337,"I’m not saying she shouldn’t shower, but there is something rich about a bunch of men saying that woman is being too much when they demand much more. 


Women are expected to suck dick regardless of condition. Women are expected to be freshly showered and shaven before men even think about going down. 


BUT ALSO — calling vaginas smelly is DIRECTLY related to misogynistic commentary on women. Like it isn’t the goddamn same because the historical and sociocultural context isn’t the same. 

Again where are the memes, jokes, ridicule, and harmful impact of women making fun of men for having gross dicks?!? It’s a fucking highlight of porn / its own goddamn sub genre / theme. 

That’s what I’m calling out with that double standard. 

BUT 

Showering everyday would be normally fine, but for this woman she has a sensitive nose so the extra effort isn’t asking for much. It’s a contextual key here.  

Calling her a hypochrondriac and all the other shit you said is fucked because you didn’t even fucking care about her position.

Seriously? Have you? It sucks! If I wasn’t so acclimated, it would be a thousand times worse. I feel bad for all the women who would just deal with that. Here we have a women speaking up and not just dealing with male bullshit. good for her

I’m not calling you stupid or that you shouldn’t speak up. I’m allowed to disagree with you. You don’t always have to be right or agreed with.

He goes online to receive a massive dose of love bombing from the cult, no matter what he says it’s always ‘yup you’re a cracked egg, you’re trans, cut it off and cut everyone out of your life who doesn’t agree, they are evil TERFs’ then they attack anything that says other wise to make sure this young boy ONLY sees their opinion. Somehow every person who regretted SRS is a bigot, every person trying to protect this boy by showing him the actual-no joke- truth about what to expect is silenced one way or another. Doctors are silenced, researchers are silenced, therapists silenced, the few parents that seem to care enough -silenced.

All they have is the sacchirine fantasy version of transition that is sold to them on TIM hubboxes (""gynecologists can't tell the difference!"")

Pubic hair is going to washed at the same time as head hair, in the shower/bath. Someone with poor hygiene is gonna have naggy hair everywhere. Who only washes their head and doesn't bother with the rest of their body? It's just such a weird thing to believe."

My parents took pride in my assertiveness because they knew no one would try and walk all over me.  But I never thought I was a boy, and no one else thought I was a boy.

I have honestly yet to come upon a trans woman who isn't sexually extreme, every one I've seen online is bragging about their Bad Dragon horse dildo collection or begging to be abducted and raped because, evidenced by this post, it would seem that's what they think women are naturally made to like.

Not to say there aren't cis men and women doing this crazy shit too, but I also find plenty of cis people who are very vanilla or mild despite still being openly slutty on twitter. But the trans women, they're on a whole other level, they are always super super kinky and want giant insertions and 10 partners at once and tons of crazy shit. I have yet to see a trans woman who is vanilla, basically."

We all know that people who actually are X don't need to say they iDeNtiFy themselves as X, nor do they stop being X if they choose to say they don't iDenTiFy as X, regardless of X is black, gay, female, etc. 

For example if X=black, someone like Barack Obama doesn't need to ""identify"" himself as black; he is black. Even if for whatever reason he said he doesn't ""identify"" himself as black, he still is black. 

Similarly, the word *identity* is something that is determined by far more important  things than just one's perception of themselves. It's why Barack Obama has a black ""identity"", and he didn't get that identity based on his own perception of himself, or whether or not he says he ""identifies"" as black.

I think you can ""identify"" into womanhood so long as womanhood is just a club or a set of skills or a way of thinking but not if its an innate part of who you are like actually being female is."

Female hands are incredibly smol and delicate, and thus lack the muscle required to get a firm grip on anything and thus, they drop everything.

He once felt he wanted to transition into a woman. I have zero doubt he would have bought himself crap like this.

When the definition of a woman becomes more based on tacky outfits and stupid fetishes, our reality as biological women ceases to be at all relevant, which is why they justify their anger at ""TERFs"" and preserving nonsense like this, while our righteous anger is deemed transphobic. Astonishing."

3758,"Anime doesn't affect everyone in the same way. But it absolutely to some degree funnels certain men into AGP and other forms of self-fetishization.

3774,"When I was primarily studying the Holocaust in grad school, one semester I also had a class on the civil rights movement in the U.S., so I ended up buying a bunch of books on slavery as well as some on antisemitism.  I'm also a big fan of doing my own beauty treatments, including acid peels, and I buy those supplies from Amazon as well.  

When I signed in one day, I had a weird recommendation list that included hair relaxers and skin bleaching creams (which are usually *incredibly* toxic and have been banned in many parts of the world, BTW), but also several neo Nazi white supremacist manifesto type of books.  Their algorithm had somehow decided I was a female black neo Nazi who wanted to look as white as possible, I think?"

3776,"TIMs: Alice, Lily, Evelyn (donna lmao)

TIFs: Jason, Chris, Adam 

One just wants to be normal and the other wants to have a hyper-feminized name"
3777,"You are right.  I’d much rather “Alice” buys his outfit online. That way he can’t...
- harrass female shop assistants, e.g. requesting bra fittings from female shop assistants who cannot say no because it’s their job, thus forcing women to participate in their fetish. 
- leave semen behind in the changing room, because of that erection and jerk off sesh, sorry oops I mean “gender euphoria”, which inevitably follows trying on skirts
- steal their sisters/moms underwear and jerk off in them. 
All 3 of these examples I have seen documented in this sub.  

... OPs post *is* problematic. It shows that TiMs are only interested in dressing as “women” insofar as their warped, caricatured, overly sexualised version of it allows. Real women do not wear fetish wear outside, but TIMs do. 

I suggest you actually do some reading from the sidebar links if you want to understand this sub, and gender critical feminism, instead of just going off what you’ve been told by the TRA cult about those “scary terfs”. Because your ignorance is really showing with this comment."
3778,I mean it is fitted to a woman's body.

3783,"At this point it's kind of questionable as to whether or not they can even be called ""women's"" clothing. I wouldn't be surprised if more men actually wore those things than actual women. Plus there's nothing to suggest that they're even designed for women's legs or that they fit women's legs better somehow."

3785,But they arrrrrrrrre real women don’t you see.
3786,"The stockings are somewhat popular with girls here in Japan.

Not “girls” in the way TIMs infantilize women; actual children. The way TIMs dress emulates fashion of preteens/tweens. Not a good look."

3805,"He was a deeply, stupidly, pathetically confused person in more ways than just this. For a couple of days he thought he was gay because being hugged by his brother made him feel good. For a while he thought he was actually transwoman because ""women have a wider range of clothes"" and also the 3D women in the program he animates, I quote ""women have a larger number of polygons than men"" which makes female bodies more ""detailed and interesting"". For a while he believed that humans didn't actually need sleep at all, and the entire concept of sleep was this huge conspiracy preventing people from reaching their full potential."
3806,"They don't. I have thigh high socks, and they're not fans of my womanly thighs. You have to be a very specific shape to get them to work, and 95% of women aren't.

3807,"I wore them at a pre teen but as an adult , I just wear leggings or tights"
3808,"From what I've heard from my friend in Japan, she says that Japanese school uniforms do not look anything like this; you only see this type of design in anime and pretty much the only time girls (teenagers to adult) actually dress like this anime-style design is when they're trying to cosplay."
3809,He means he thinks he's done with his transition and now 'passes' as a woman online.
3810,Right? Even in anime it's not very common anymore
3811,TIMs always get stuck on the look of the first girls they fapped to. This is why hons try so hard to look like a girl in a Whitesnake video.

3819,I worked with an Asuna once. It was not a very fitting name.
3820,They literally don't have the balls to pick a guy's name that isn't uwu aesthetic like Kyle and yet they expect me to believe that they want to be seen as men
3821,"*All* those -den names seem to be popular with TIFs, like Jayden, Brayden, Caden, Hayden, etc., and there seems to be an awful lot of names beginning with ""C,"" like Chase, Charlie, and Chris.  I've actually wondered if there are a lot of Charlies and Chrisses because they might be nicknames from their former female names like Charlotte, Christine, or Christina."
3822,"Lol I've definitely seen Levi but not the others, good call though"

3827,"I love thigh high socks. My shorter, tiny friends wear them a lot. I am doomed to a life of them forever rolling down. 

The ones that don’t roll down are usually the ones that are made of nylon and have some band. The lingerie / porn-y ones. The ones that are totally impractical as socks.

There’s a difference if you getting them from the sock aisle vs the lingerie aisle."
3828,"I don’t mean the uniforms, just the stockings. Children sometimes wear them in their casual outfits."
3829,"It's odd that so much of the current trans phenomenon is based upon Japan, its culture, and particularly its anime, yet it isn't *Japan* that is being overrun with AGP TIMs and ""gay dude"" TIFs.

Nobody is surprised to discover that China or Russia has deliberately been fucking with the west, but maybe it's Japan that is the *real* nation trying to take us down secretly.  We won WWII and dropped nuclear bombs on them, but they'll punish us *all* with the looming totalitarian Transocracy and the weeb incel armies demanding sex robots in revolutions to come. 🤔😀"
3830,"I'm a full bodied weeb who loves both moe idol nonsense and fashion. I see the trends are going to the plainer/more conservative outfits and natural look like 22/7 anime mirroring the more covering trends even for idols like the 46 groups, on top of that japanese girls/women wear midi or longer skirt in general now. Even the obviously leering to idol otakus like BudouOshi has plainer, non outrageous clothes for the idols but I guess that's boring for these ppl."
3831,"I guess. But idk, I will always expect more than this from these ppl since they are very competitive as they are allegedly more woman than actual woman that they'd actually be a respectable, fashionable woman who knows trends, colours of the season and dress accordingly. If you want to be what stereotype of a woman, then have deep interest in actual fashion not just fetish gears or drag fashion. Is it so hard to dress like a self respecting and trend conscious woman? Most women in public jobs has to do it, why not them too? It's driving me crazy."
3832,"Sorry, I just snortlaughed, it's amazing."
3833,"Nah feel free to wear whatever you like, goths, punks, butch women/flamboyant men and vintage lovers has been for a while with some snides comments on the side. 

Personal taste is not the same with mass trends tho. Like I've said in my previous comment, most women are ""expected"" to at least look nice, presentable and up-to-date and these fellas claim to be more womanly than women because they have to ""fight and learn"" their femininity then why can't they do this right? Lol. Welcome in being a woman in 2020, it is hellish."
3834,Well here we're talking about wearing the whole school uniform with the choker and the thigh highs. I fail to see how a woman just wearing a choker is fetishistic.
3835,"So no you’ve never seen a real woman dressed like a man in shitty drag. A skirt with stockings are not the same as being dressed like an incel man trying to be an anime girl, way to back pedal. 

Choker like the animal collar kind tims wear or you mean a choker style necklace? There are necklaces that are snug and men everywhere think it’s meaningful.

I too had a plastic choker necklace because they were popular in the 90s-00s and I had men be like hurrr durrr doo ya kno wut dat is heehee doo u kno 

They’d do it alllll the fucking time as if they were going to cream their pants over the connotations of a style of jewelry"
3836,"A choker? I've literally never seen a female wear a cat bell choker outside. Chokers yes (chokers are not inherently sexual and are common in emo and goth culture) but with a cheap ass giant bell like they're a cat? Yeah no. I don't see that. Not in public. Nor have I seen women wearing anime socks in public (plenty obvious trans women tho) and least but not a fucking school girl outfit (unless they're actually in school!) Where do you people get your idea of women from? The only time I see women proudly flaut things like this is if they are in porn and wearing it in a picture of video. 

Like do transwomen know what normal clothing is? Can they literally not think of an outfit that isn't somw shity cheap cosplay?? Do they know women wear pants more often than skirts? Or that our whole wardrobes are very seldomly based solely around our fetishes??"
3837,"everything but the bell ive seen at once, yeah

and if we include online, also the bell"
3838,"That one sounds like a really cute cat/dog name (and it's really common), but it doesn't suit well for humans AT ALL. I don't understand why they don't see that."
3839,"honestly! my sisters ex TIM changed his/her name to this when they transitioned. First it was Kirsten though or something

She isn't a trans widow though. he transitioned like 3 years into their relationship then she tried to make it work for like a year and then she left him/her. Oh actually I think it was because they were really poor but all the money was going on new female clothes and makeup for him and laser hair removal and sperm freezing while she had nothing new and was dressed in hand me downs! Typical narcissistic behaviour of TIMs actually so I guess maybe she is a trans widow!"
3840,Shit name from a shit anime. lmao
3841,"Imagine a transman named Abner or Elmer. Or, like, *Archibald.*

lmao if I met one with the ovaries to call herself that I just might go along with it just for the lols."
3842,"Do children in Japan really wear ""thigh highs""?  That seems rather sexy for a child.  Surely they wear knee highs, right?"
3843,"Oh, yeah. Yes i've seen children wear them as tights but not as stockings personally."
3844,"I feel like this was written in a language I almost understand, but not quite. 😂"
3845,Based.
3846,I'd say it's still popular amongst the weeb community because Zettai Ryouki is still a strong meme there
3847,"Men don't really like fashion trends that feminine girls and women tend to like, hence the copious amount of lists on the internet with ""things that women like to wear but men hate"". Harem pants, peplum, platforms and flatforms, etc.
They aren't interested in feminine things, they are interested in dressing like a woman (or girl, ugh) they would beat their meat to."
3848,"> Most women in public jobs has to do it,

No we don't. get the f out of here with that sexist bs."
3849,imagine thinking a weird online minority of younger trans people who like anime represents an entire group of people
3850,What...what does wearing a choker mean?  Was I sending out some creepy sex signal when I wore a couple chokers as a teen?  I'm usually afraid to find out the answers to the questions I ask here.
3851,">men everywhere think it's meaningful

>as if they were going to scream their pants

If something's ""meaning"" is ""cream their pants"", it's a fetish.

Did you read your own post?"

3853,"I have a bell choker from Highschool because I love cats and anime. But let me tell you that shit ends in five seconds because it’s annoying. 

But the collars are from furries and bdsm fetishes. Gross collaring traditions. Blech"
3854,It was the cat in Sailor Moon.
3855,“Lunabelle” is on my list of possible names for my future daughter. Mom says it sounds like a cat name but I think it’s pretty :c
3856,"Luna is the cat in sailor moon (which is a pretty popular trans show since it's about sexy 14 year olds. I'm dating a transgirl because I like her but she knows and is sad that shes not a biowoman.,

3860,"Nope, they wear thigh highs. I’ve seen elementary schoolers in them. It’s more childish than sexy; they have cute, childish designs on them."
3861,I’ll be completely honest: I have no idea what the difference between those is.
3862,I sometimes forgot that most people on the internet are not a proud I HAVE MULTIPLE LIGHTSTICK FOR MAKING BIG ASS CHEERS FOR MY IDOLS AND I DREAM TO DESIGN FOR AN IDOL GROUP SOMEDAY like my friends and I. For that I am so sorry.

3865,"To the incel/mra/men you’ll have the misfortune of interacting with in this sub anything choker style is basically a choker as in something you’d wear because you like to be choked in a sexual way. If you’re wearing one it’s automatically sexual, probably means you’re a slut or a whore or something.  That’s the rambling mansplaintion ive heard at least.
If we wear a necklace it’s totally the same as some putrid man in drag wearing a belled collar like the fetishist he is. 

God forbid women and girls wear anything with out a man sexualizing and mansplaining the origins or symbolism or whatever. Ironic how men never seem to stop talking which is another thing they accuse women of."
3866,"I've found it to be worse in college, since in high school there's more pressure to not stand out. But that didnt stop one girl from dressing in full out lolita fashion like a Victorian era porcelain doll every day. Now she just dresses like OP's picture though, which is somehow less outlandish."
3867,"But it's also a super common name for pets in general, anime aside."
3868,"omgggggg, imagine one of them looking at Shrek like 'transition goals!'"
3869,"Knee highs on children and teens is fine, and I just assumed that kids in Japan wore KNEE highs and not THIGH highs.  TIMs wear thigh highs when they do their Japanese school girl thing, and assume that school girls in anime wear thigh highs.

Ugh.  This is all so fucking disgusting.  Anime and TIMs are obsessed with sexualizing children.  I especially feel sorry for girls in Japan who are just going to freaking school to get an education.  They have been turned into fetish material.  It's so cruel."
3870,">Women into fashion wear thigh high ones, but they don’t look that sexy. Its mostly for “cute” outfits. It’s as plain as wearing leggings or tights.

By fashion, you're referring to zettai ryouiki, right? I thought it was a mostly (somewhat fetishy) anime thing but I've heard that sometimes it does make its way into everyday fashion too."
3871,"This isn’t about school uniforms, I was referring to casual wear. Younger kids absolutely wear thigh highs here. They usually grow out of wearing them by JHS/high school."
3872,"It's a regional thing depending on where you live in the world. When I said ""stockings"", I was referring to the type that only go up to your thigh, such as the ones in the OP. When I said ""tights"", I was referring to the type that go up to your waist."
3873,"Oh don’t worry, I have extreme nerd inclinations towards other things like comic books and architectural history and I’m sure that’s what I sound like when someone accidentally engages me on one of those topics."

3875,"I don't think a lot of these people know the meaning of ""anime aside"""
3876,Someone out there has a trans Shrek headcanon
3877,"Yeah and no. Like, not just mini skirts. Shorts, dresses, or even longer skirts. The idea of that short distance between the socks and skirt definitely is a fetish thing that also has made into everyday fashion, but it’s kind of a chicken & egg situation. 

Woman wearing socks and skirts turns into men fetishizing the gap turns into women making the gap into a fashion accessory."
3878,Ah. I meant the ones that end at your thighs.
3879,"Huh, to me the difference between tights and stockings is that tights are opaque and generally made of thicker material, and stockings are sheer and translucent.  It must be a distinction that varies regionally as you said."
3880,"It's wild how 48 groups now has declined. I thought they are going to be forever. I think super short skirt, sexy idol era will come back in 10 years as it would still stay in niche market. Fashion is a cycle, and there are theory that many countries with stagnanting economy would prefer more conservative trends and when the economy is booming, clothes would be flashy again (eg: us in the 80s vs the us now with beige/neutral). This applies to character designs too at least in more ""real"" shows. I just love clothes and moe shit man. I wish I aint but I dooooo"

3893,"Thing is, for most of them, the ability to look *believably, passable female* has long gone. You need to start the hormones before puberty and get FFS (facial feminization). Even then you will never quite look as good as a real woman. And real women will always have the one thing that to many of them think gives women power - a real vagina.  Even if it was true that all vaginas were magic, there isn't good enough medical science to give these guys a real vagina.

Just a hole that can get infections easily. Their only real hole is their ass. If you ask most men what would they prefer, fucking a real woman's vagina or a makeshift hole and an ass, they'd choose the real vagina. I doubt the ass feels half as good as a real vagina."

3914,"Reminds me of Umberto Eco's essay on fascism. 

*""The first feature of Ur-Fascism is the cult of tradition. Traditionalism is of course much older than fascism. Not only was it typical of counter-revolutionary Catholic thought after the French revolution, but it was born in the late Hellenistic era, as a reaction to classical Greek rationalism. In the Mediterranean basin, people of different religions (most of them indulgently accepted by the Roman Pantheon) started dreaming of a revelation received at the dawn of human history. This revelation, according to the traditionalist mystique, had remained for a long time concealed under the veil of forgotten languages – in Egyptian hieroglyphs, in the Celtic runes, in the scrolls of the little known religions of Asia.
This new culture had to be syncretistic. Syncretism is not only, as the dictionary says, “the combination of different forms of belief or practice”; such a combination must tolerate contradictions. Each of the original messages contains a silver of wisdom, and whenever they seem to say different or incompatible things it is only because all are alluding, allegorically, to the same primeval truth.
As a consequence, there can be no advancement of learning. Truth has been already spelled out once and for all, and we can only keep interpreting its obscure message.
One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements. The most influential theoretical source of the theories of the new Italian right, Julius Evola, merged the Holy Grail with The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, alchemy with the Holy Roman and Germanic Empire. The very fact that the Italian right, in order to show its open-mindedness, recently broadened its syllabus to include works by De Maistre, Guenon, and Gramsci, is a blatant proof of syncretism.
If you browse in the shelves that, in American bookstores, are labeled as New Age, you can find there even Saint Augustine who, as far as I know, was not a fascist. But combining Saint Augustine and Stonehenge – that is a symptom of Ur-Fascism.""*

Combining communism with teenage anime girls and Kirby is fascism 😁"

3931,"There's been an influx of male conservatives here, it's annoying. They're similar to the people we're criticising in that they're very misogynistic.

3968,"I loved how on the Blaire White stream, he pulled out a pad and was like “why would I have this if I didn’t need it?”

Uh... because you have a period fetish?"

Yaniv. Why the fuck you lying~ ya got balls, no ovaries.


I really don't know if he is just delusional or he enjoys attention from lying. Either way, he's a predator and knows what he is doing. Abusing Canada's silly laws so he can invade women's spaces."
3973,This “person”’is a pedo with a mensuration fetish who harassed young girls online for their used tampons...
3974,"Just a few reminders of his opinions on minorities:

'she was a towel head terrorist bitch' - a lady who asked JY to stop recording her on a bus

'yeah hes a dirty nigger' - directed to a black college student, unclear why

'she was some cunt. some gook cunt' - about someone who refused to serve him in a nail salon

'i don't want to go to some gook place....or a nigger place or anywhere dirty like that' - when talking about salons local to him.


You'll be AMAZED to learn that ALL of the 14 salons targeted by JY were minority owned."
3975,He posted this *after* he was called out for messaging little girls to get them to talk about periods/tampons/pads?

3981,Lots of comments seem to know him. Is he famous or something?
3982,we all know that's Jessica Yaniv no need to censor it
3983,This is written the exact way a man would write what he thinks a womans life is like.
3984,"Yes, my dad also has periods."
3985,"Think of this person as a developing sociological study...i wonder what mental health professionals would think of this. Has anyone tried to diagnose him? 
Also idk bout you ladies but my period usually always “stops” when i swim....i literally have never swam with a tampon in 😂😂"
3986,And I’m bigoted for thinking this person is human garbage btw
3987,I guess the RCMP raid led to nothing if he's back posting.
3988,"Menophilia.


Thanks that is all.

I have shamed him enough for this shit on twitter."
3989,what a depraved piece of shit. absolutely no one believes that this full on pedophillic male has a menstrual cycle
3990,Where does the tampon go??
3991,How is this person not in prison?
3992,Wow that’s SOOOOO relatable to me as a woman /s
3993,Yeah and I forgot my dick in my other bag

4000,What a shit stain
4001,Thankfully most of the comments on his tweets aren’t positive. But still.. Who in their right mind would *like* the tweet?
4002,"it's disturbing how there's hundreds of people who are still actually on his side, granted some number of them might be bots/sockpuppets but still..."
4003,Don't forget the sexual abuse on all the adult women hes been in bathrooms with
4004,"Because of the ladybrain, you BIGOT. It makes ladies incapable of problem-solving (and gets much worse around periods— literally all we can do that week is throw tantrums and binge on junk food)."
4005,"I want him jailed, but I also really do enjoy seeing all the depraved shit he says and posts.


He thrives on the attention, and we shouldn't be giving it to him, but... It's hard to look away."
4006,"Exactly, what woman would post something like that on Twitter?! A lot of women wouldn't even say it to the people they were with ffs."
4007,He's flaunting his freedom. He's rubbing it in everyone's faces that he's an unapolagetic pedophilic pervert and getting away with it.
4008,"He pretends that he has both a vagina and a dick, so he thinks people actually believe that he uses pads.

I wouldn't be surprised if he had a Chris Chan un-clit situation down there. 🤢"
4009,"Right? How is being at a pool worth a post, and “so much fun” if he didn’t even go in? Obviously just a vehicle for his fetish"
4010,I also find it really disturbing that he had a taser.....he claims it’s for self protection but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was for kid nap.
4011,"I bet buying them at the store gives him an erection.  He probably considers it ""validation"" when the clerk just rings them up and takes his money, because he thinks the clerk thinks he's a real woman and going to use them himself.  (When really, of course, the clerk is just thinking, la la la, half an hour until break...)"
4012,I’m still salty about the fact that he had me in a position where I was agreeing with Blaire fucking White. 😑😑
4013,"To spy on kids and ask them for tampons, duh!"
4014,"He's delusional, take him to the infirmary"
4015,"A lot of people seem to not know this, he is now claiming to be intersex and have a fully functional vagina under his penis."

4019,"A little from Column A, a little from Column B"

4047,"A sTuNnInG aNd BrAvE woymynynn that's who, you BIGOT!"
4048,"Exactly. Woman here, and I’ve always had trouble even talking to *close* girl friends about my period, and I’m in my 20s. Thankfully my husband is very understanding and supportive during my period so I feel a little more comfortable talking to him about it and asking him for help (pain meds, heating pads, calm me down when I can’t control my emotions, etc.)"
4049,👆🏻Yup.👆🏻
4050,Something has to soak up the blood from a purposefully unhealed and dilated wound. Might as well be a pad I guess.

4053,And watch them swim topless without their parents around
4054,I wanted to slap that dude
4055,"The infirmary in prison.

The men's prison."
4056,"Oh yeah, when Blair White called him out, that was the first excuse out of his mouth. 

JY seems genuinely special needs (on top of his mental illness) and seriously the whole video was Blair calling him a liar and him saying “it’s not true” or straight up admitting that he lied.

One of the comments was like, “It’s so sad to see how Chris griffin went downhill these days” 😂"
4057,">  he is now claiming to be intersex and have a fully functional vagina under his penis.

Which is physically impossible. [Growing a penis seals up the vagina](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-d8nm1qQa3uw/UWJMx4CwaYI/AAAAAAAAAbg/knhfRXToJRU/s1600/GenitalDevelopment.jpg), that's why there's a line along the underside of the penis to the anus. One or the other."
4058,It’s gonna be the unclit all over again.
4059,"Sure.....yessica. Suuuuuure. And last night I made out with Brie Larson and Gal Gadot.

4062,Go for it
4063,Yeah but Jessica still has a penis.
4064,Enough internet for today.
4065,">worked on to still be open

Yeah, forced dilation and medication to slow down the body trying to heal an open wound. 

Honestly the fact that Canada let's this predator walk free every day basically tells you how lost that country is."
4066,"I've seen it on his KF thread, not sure of the page as there is a lot of material there."
4067,KF archives all the rope this spectacular moron is laying to hang himself with
4068,It’s a liability. Even here in the states.
4069,Maybe a lighting storm was predicted.

How is his case going? Is he sued for sexual harassment?"

4073,They were born as a guy but they say they're trans (so girl). But not many people believe them - they're most likely just a pedophile that takes advantage of the attention/support trans people are getting.

how old are u?   
lol   
   
   
   
*seen at 3:55 pm*"
4075,Do you know if they put him in the women's jail? Imma be fucking FURIOUS if they did.
4076,That’s awesome! 😂
4077,I didn't see it. Did he threaten Blair with it?
4078,"Ha, could be!  I was imagining someone being in ""customer service mode,"" just acting friendly but not actually giving a shit about who is buying what.  But he probably makes a show of buying them somehow so he might very well stand out."
4079,"Don't forget how he claims people are repeatedly impersonating him online. That wasn't him sending those creepy pedo messages, guys!"
4080,"In the case of intersex people, which he is not, the genitals can be in between the two. Sometimes to the point where it's hard to visually identify the genitalia as male or female."
4081,Do I even want to know what that is?
4082,Do you think it’s a fetish for Chris or do you think it’s more of an issue of him being confused?  I feel like it’s less sexual for him and more of him having such a poor grip on reality and being easily manipulated by things he reads online.
4083,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news but yeah it is. A handful of people on 4chan have posted their post-op photos and experiences and it's truly disgusting what these people will go through to have a ""vagina""."

4085,That is so vile. And to think they consider that the same as a real vagina...it boggles the mind
4086,"Yaniv has already been arrested, apartment tossed and weapons seized plus theres an open investigation related to contacts of a sexual nature with a minor. It's only a matter of time before JY is in the pedo wing of a federal prison."
4087,Please stop giving me nightmares. The mental imagery of this is giving me similar vibes to someone smashing a puppy's head against a wall.
4088,Hey don’t blame Canada blame the PM’s need to appear as liberal/enabling as possible because he has no other merit.
4089,"okay yeah my first thought was ""why is this man free and not in or under a jail somewhere?"""
4090,"Oh ok, didn't look like a guy"
4091,"Im not sure.. it was only one day, so itd have been a holding cell if anything. He said he had a seizure as they arrested him too, so they had to go to a hospital first lol. Id guess theyd have kept him out front or in a special solo ""high risk""  cell. The fella is pretty mentally ill afterall..."
4092,"He wasn't jailed, get your facts straight and top being so histrionic.

He was detained in a holding cell so RCMP could toss his apartment and investigate allegations of him having an illegal (for Cancuckistan) weapon. Said search took over 20 hours so they were obviously investigating a lot more than that


I know Reddit likes to consider itself far more superior than KF but all the relavent information is stored and archived there  - please familiarise yourself with it"
4093,"Here's the video, I copied this link at a specific time to when it happens:

https://youtu.be/bnhnShhxfhQ?t=3546

Should be around 59:25"
4094,"> But he probably makes a show of buying them somehow so he might very well stand out.

This 100%

It’s clear that involving non-consenting women and girls is a crucial element of his fetish. The more visually uncomfortable they are, the more exciting it is for him. It’s a power thing. The sooner he is in a male prison, the better."
4095,"Yep, but then it's a mega clit + vag, with an enlarged clitoris and  a misshapen vagina. You sometimes see this in women with CAH where they get too much DHT in utero.

I'd post links to the medical journal images, but I think that would probably get a ban under the indecent images of kids. Let's just say, it's usually a 'not one or the other, but definitely not both' scenario."
4096,Chris Chan stabbed his taint and called it a vagina.
4097,No.
4098,"O the disrespect. Women have been fighting off nasty comments about fish smells for years. And now our natural, self-cleaning vaginas are being lumped in with septic wounds. I heard my little nephew (6) saying to his older sister (8) 'you didn't wash your ""guilty"" and now it smells', as an apparent joke. I almost fainted. Boys are learning that shit propaganda so young."
4099,This was perfect
4100,Whats disgusting is anyone who would willingly engage in sex with that. What rational person would put their dick or mouth in/ on a gaping open wound.
4101,I thought he had already been released and that was only for having prohibited weapons.
4102,"No it's not. He loves in Canada, which is up there with Sweden and the UK for having a spineless, useless judicial system and pathetic CPS. 


Also trans people have privelidge. They can get away with this horsecrap and they do. The ones who claim ""but Ah gabes up muh male profledge!!"" are mental and wrong"
4103,"I think he's probably got onto the RCMP radar and they are quietly looking through his internet history and previous life.

The longer he is out, the more rope he has to hang himself."
4104,At least the puppy doesn't try to fuck kids.
4105,What is KF?
4106,"Oh dear.  That just made me wonder.  Does he have tmi conversations with store clerks about this subject?  Like asking them for advice, what kind they use?  Does he tell the checkout clerk about his cramps?  Surely, if so, he would have been banned from stores by now, but in this pc climate, who knows?

And yes, the sooner he gets into a male prison, the better!  Though it probably won't much matter, he'll be spending so much time in AdSeg for his own protection."
4107,Ya something fucked up going on here. Why is a 6 year old allowed to speak that way? Where did he learn it from?
4108,[deleted]
4109,"I'm sure he probably heard something along those lines elsewhere as an insult and he's just repeating it without really understanding.  What really concerns me is that he thinks ""guilty"" is a synonym for vagina."
4110,There are some men who will stick their dicks into just about anything.
4111,"Kids hear all kinds of things filtered down, and if they gather that it's insulting or vulgar they will repeat it just to try it out or to see what reaction they get. Possibly as a way of gathering information.

When I was that age I told my dad that I didn't like Van Halen because David Let Roth was a slut. I liked VH and DLR solo, but I had heard the word and knew it was some kind of swear. I was hoping that when my dad scolded me he would tell me what it meant."
4112,I was guessing the playground or overheard his mother talking to his sister.
4113,"He may have heard it elsewhere used insultingly, and was trying it out without really knowing what it meant. I used all kinds of insults at that age without understanding then because I'd heard teenagers say them."
4114,"Someone who willingly does that is just as sick as the person with open wound pretending that's all there is to being a woman. 

Third in the list is the doctor who swore to do no harm then performs these surgeries for profit on the mentally ill."
4115,"Reminds me of what every teenage boy says to the question “what would you do if you were female for one day?”

A: “Play with my boobs all day”"
4116,"I look at mine a lot, but that's mostly to determine whether those two lonely hairs are long enough to be trimmed yet."
4117,The only time I touch mine in any real way is to check for lumps. 
4118,"I look at mine to check that they’re NOT showing too much in my outfit, but ... that’s probably not what they’re thinking..."
4119,I've seen enough male-gaze media that that part of my body makes me actively uncomfortable. It's a symbol of my involuntary objecthood.
4120,"When I'm on the phone I play with my boobs. I don't know why but I just do,Its not sexual at all. I've never been turned on by my boobs though. Watching my husband play with them does turn me on but that's bout it."
4121,"Lmao good burn.

Personally, I look at my tits a lot. When I'm getting dressed in the morning and before bed. I like how they look. It's not sexual, in the way I might admire another woman's boobs. Theyre just there and I appreciate them. Usually grab for them when I lose something. But it's not sexual. "

How did I miss that 2-inch black keratin tentacle sticking straight out of my tit like a thorn?"
4128,I had a guy rip out one of mine out of nowhere in bed once. 😖
4129,"Meh I fiddle with mine every so often but it's not sexual, it's just like any other body part "
4130,"This has really made me think. I'm currently wearing what I'd call an around-the-house dress, cos it scoops real low at the front and at the arms so I'm basically all hanging out. 

I realised that there's a tingle of uncomfortable-ness on my chest, because even tho this is a super comfy dress, I'm on show and could nip slip at any moment. Even in my own house, just me and my husband, at the back of my mind, I'm aware of my movements enough to always be factoring in whether I'm falling out of the dress or not.

4131,Men do the same thing with their balls
4132,"Well that's what an effective female socialization to the male gaze looks like. We're hyperaware of our boobs and look at them in that way, even if it isn't sexual for us."

4134,inb4 that's a slur
4135,"Women do not get turned on by the contextless idea of wearing women's clothing, engaging in feminine behaviors/activities, contemplating their female anatomic features, exhibiting their female bodily functions, or interacting with other people as a woman. It is highly sexist to suggest that women are turned on by the idea of femininity and womanhood in and of itself. Own your fucking AGP and stop projecting it onto women to justify your identity. Spoken from a fellow AGP."
4136,"Ugh the areola bumps. I think they're like glands(?) Or whatever, but I can't help but pick at them sometimes even if I know it'll result in a sore in a few days. Then I feel ashamed because I have a red bump on my boob. Lol"

4138,"I'm an actual woman, so, no."
4139,Is that word really not allowed here? Why?
4140,"Holy shit you took my comment and ran with it!
Genuinely all I said was that women absolutely do admire their own body. Nowhere did I even suggest that women everywhere absolutely get off to the very idea of femininity and women's clothing. I did nothing of the sort.

I get the difference you're going for where AGP is concerned but that's not what I was discussing and don't presume anything about me and my views on women or femininity. I'm not ""projecting"" anything here; not remotely claiming anything about my ""identity."""

4146,"Admiring your body and getting turned on by your body are two entirely different things. And girls getting their breasts is often a traumatic experience for them.

4157,Haha seriously? No wonder 🤦‍♀️ ugh.
4158,"Oh fuck off. There is a difference between finding yourself attractive and getting turned on by yourself. Funny how all the stories about adolescents' stealing their mom's or sister's clothes and masturbating while wearing them are from males. If you are or have ever been aroused by the thought of yourself as a woman, you have autogynephilia. If your cross-gender identity did not develop in very early childhood, like before the ages of 3 or 4, than your desire to be a woman is rooted in paraphilic arousal. Most of us who admit to being AGP like myself have a similar story to yours. I have always preferred the company of females and cross-gender feelings appeared before puberty. My cross-gender feelings originated from when I was turned on by the idea of wearing pantyhose when I was 7 and I eventually started fetishistically crossdressing when I was 13. The paraphilic arousal couldn't have been any more obvious. Be honest with yourself about your identity for once. AGP doesn't invalidate it. For some reason, I'm not going to ban you. But if you argue against AGP or project it onto women again, I will.

And the women in those two articles are isolated cases. EXCEPTIONS ARE NOT THE NORM. They may have something resembling AGP, but it isn't comparable. Some women actually do have something very similar to AGP. It's called autoandrophilia (arousal to the idea of being a man) and quite a few FTMs appear to have it. You obviously have never read any of the literature on AGP and are only parroting what your echo chamber has told you."

4160,"Oh look, the TIM returned to further mansplain female sexuality to us. It is so infuriating how they project their paraphilia onto women. And I'm a man. I can't even to begin to imagine how insulted women must feel by it."
4161,"If you look at the articles I linked, they specifically use the words ""turned on"", so I can't say I understand your initial rebuttal.

""Exceptions are not the norm"" is exactly the same point I was making, if you read my comment, but I'd be more likely to say that *your* experience in this case is the exception. But I don't see why you think you know better than the voices of the majority of trans people whose experiences don't align with yours. It borders on conspiracy theorist territory, when you insist that somehow the majority of trans people are lying in a collective desire to fool the public.

Everybody's trans experience is individual to them. Yours may be autogynephilic, but there are thousands who haven't had that same experience. I can honestly say that I have never been aroused just by the thought of having a woman's body. There is nothing for me to ""accept"", because my experience is entirely different from yours.

Interestingly, I was given a copy of ""The Man who would be Queen"", by my naïve aunt last year, and I did actually end up reading it, because I'm interested in learning about the other side of the story. I can't say it was an enjoyable read, but it certainly gave another perspective to consider - which, after consideration, I have found to be poorly representative.

And I'd rather leave than stay, to be honest, I'm not interested in commenting here any more. I'll go back to my echo chamber. Though I would like to just ask that you not delete my comments, because for one thing, it gives a different perspective, and for another, you would just be creating your own echo chamber, which would be a bit ironic.

Thanks for your time."

Nah, transvestism is still a quite common path to transsexualism and my experience fits the [typical developmental path of transvestism](http://www.tbuckner.com/TRANSVES.HTM).

Anne Lawrence's representation of AGP is much less stigmatizing and much more consistent with the experiences of MtF transsexuals. I'd suggest you check out her work if you are ever interested in learning more on the subject. I actually think the she way conceptualizes AGP in her ""[Becoming What We Love](http://www.annelawrence.com/becoming_what_we_love.pdf)"" paper is a beautiful way to understand our cross-gender desires."

4212,Is self harming ok because it's consensual?
4213,"I never understood this argument. You’re telling me that having a man intentionally prolapse a woman’s anus to derive sexual pleasure from it is okay because that woman consented to it? Even though that will have severe repercussions for her body for the rest of her life? If you’re indifferent, that’s one thing. But let’s not file this under “its consensual so it’s harming no one.” When it comes to porn, and the acts then copied in real life, very few people are left unharmed by that. Whether in a literal sense or a broader sense—like how “mommy”/“daddy” kinks can be arguably harmful for children because it simulates a child-parent relationship and degenerates it by making it sexual. This has had real effects on children and real effects on both men and women. This is not just theoretical bullshit. “This can be harmful but other things can be harmful too” what are you talking about? Yeah, and we should talk about those things too. Alcohol is absolutely abused and has caused too many early deaths. Why take focus away from the harm that’s being done here because you don’t think it’s as bad? The thing is—yeah, people who want to cause bodily harm to others intentionally to derive sexual pleasure are not normal. I’m not going to say it’s normal; it’s not. It’s either the result of addiction through porn which warps sexuality, or the result of abuse which can also warp understanding of sexuality. I personally understand both. Trauma has destroyed my sexuality, and I’m a drug addict; I know how addiction affects the brain. But there are also just men who are narcissistic, abusive, or socio-/psychopathic who enjoy hurting women. What’s the benefit of telling THOSE men that their desire to hurt women for sexual pleasure is good and okay? Im not going to be cruel about it, but I’m not going to be indifferent or sweep it away so coldly because I can’t be bothered to care that real people are being hurt by this. We’re way past the point of this being used as an excuse anymore, if it ever was a sufficient one in the first place.

I don’t want people coming into my home or my job or my bedroom and telling me what to do or how to act. So I’m not going to do it to others? It’s none of my business. And I’m not going to judge someone and make my entire POV on them based around whatever they want to get up to sexually (unless it’s not consensual or of age, if it’s one of those you can go fuck off forever). Yeah yeah there are people that can take these types of things and make it harmful to themselves and possibly others. But so can so many other things? Alcohol. Over spending. Etc etc. and then others might just partake in these things and still be able to enjoy life and not just sit around constantly watching porn or jacking off, I think it’s rather narrow minded to paint every single person who might enjoy these things as some freak addict in a basement setting out candy to trap others into their evil lair.

I just feel that if the woman is participating and consenting and enjoying “getting hurt” it’s none of my business. If it’s not consensual? Then that is when I take issue. Until then? I just don’t truly see how it’s my business nor in what way do I have any right in telling adult consenting people what to do w their bodies. Even if it’s about porn addiction and wanting to try things one has seen in porn. If both parties are down, I don’t see why I should judge. I’m not here to police people’s sexual choices. I always feel that if it’s of age and consensual (mentally, physically, no one is intoxicated, no one is having an emotional breakdown atm, etcetc) by both parties/or however many then it’s just not any of my concern. I don’t pay any of these people’s bills.....they don’t pay my bills.

4287,">do men actually slut shame you knowing you're male?

Yep. I'm a ""femboy"" or ""trap"" or ""sissyboy"" according to them, which means apparently all feminine guys are sex-obsessed, sexually submissive ""fuckdolls"" who exist only to serve men. But oh no, men can't treat their ""fuckdolls"" nicely, it's also a bad thing that I'm apparently having all this imaginary gay sex I would never want in reality.

Exactly, which is why men, including transwomen, should be banned from women's bathrooms and locker rooms and they need to be sex-segregated. Glad you agree. Here are the stats to back up unisex bathrooms leading to increases in sexual harassment and assaults:

4292,"I couldn’t care less if they are criminals or not. They are men and I don’t want to share public bathrooms, locker rooms or showers with them. I don’t have to justify to any man why I don’t want them there,  I don’t care what they identify as, if they’ve had surgery or if they are on hormones. None of that makes them a woman.  All the name calling and insults in the world won’t make me change my mind. Pretending that men can become women is a lie. All the lies in the world will never change the truth. 
Now, I understand that trans people have problems and I wish them well. But their problems are not my problem. I shouldn’t have to deal with changing, showering or urinating in front of a man because he had problems with his masculinity. I’m sure as a woman, I’m expected to be more accommodating, but I draw the line here."

4295,I see. 8 seems like an absurd number to me
4296,It sounded like your personal complaint. TIMs don’t talk like that. They don’t sound like women. That’s what makes it so ironic. A TIM would talk about their 7 inches of depth or sucking sick or prolasing or stealing panties. They don’t talk about taking the biggest dicks because neo vaginas have more limits than a cis vagina.

What is their obsession with the idea that sleepovers are some quintessential milestone of every girl's childhood? Also, I know it's like criticising the paintwork on the Titanic but he first claims there were six people at this sleepover but then that it was seven (himself, 4 ""girls"" he knew previously and two from a friend's ""polycule."") Does sex obsession destroy your ability to do basic arithmetic?"
4327,It never gets old watching them try to justify their sex obsession and disgusting orgies as something normal

4329,"Christ on the cross. These men are deranged. 

I slept over with my female friends nonstop as a girl. Never ONCE did anyone make mention of their genitals, much less expose herself. No comparisons of genitals (ewwwwww wtf) ever took place. 

If a girl in my town had tried something creepy like that ONCE at a sleepover, it would be known by every soul in town in like 2 days, and she would be permabanned from all future sleepovers. Harsh, but true."
4330,What the actual fuck. I had lots of sleepovers as an adolescent and none of them involved sex of any kind.
4331,"Just call it an orgy, it bears zero resemblance to an adolescent girl sleepover. Gross."

Girls sleepovers are a fun, intimate time where we talk about secrets and hash out old arguments, among other things. Just another example of men stereotyping and sexualizing young girls. It's very disturbing really."
4334,"So...is he saying he’s had sex with two TIMs since becoming one, who both had average sized dicks...and he was ‘intrigued’ by this new ones larger than average penis? Don’t men see each other’s dicks a lot in toilets and changing rooms? I wouldn’t presume to know obviously, maybe that’s as big a load of bullshit as little girls getting sexual at sleepovers."

4341,"As a woman who was a girl before I have gone to quite a lot of sleepovers and let me tell you, they are nothing like this. We ate cheap microwave popcorn, played games on the console, maaaaybe talked about who we like or don't like in our class. No breast-comparing, clitty-groping (barf), spooning or whatnot.  


These dudes are delusional. They fetishize something literal 12-year olds take part in, and they get boners from it. Absolutely vile. I hate them so much."
4342,A lot of these men really are like Peter Pan.
4343,"I don’t know what kind of girlhood I had but sleepovers did NOT include talk of or comparison of genitals.

4352,Comparing boobs and penises. Totally a part of girlhood.
4353,Honestly if you n the girls are doing sexual things while your little girls (maybe aged 7-11) usually one or some of the girls were sexually abused. I know because me and my two friends did indeed kiss/first kiss/do sexual activities at such girl sleepovers and two of us were sexually abused. The third was a little older than us and at a more normal experimentation age. Nonetheless we all thought nothing of it. Looking back we had an emotional oddness from being overtly sexualized from very young ages.
4354,"Ah, girlhood sleepovers. Where you would 1) Choreograph a dance and perform for the host child's parents, siblings and pets, 2) Eat a lot of hot pockets, 3) Watch Ricki Lake and informercials when you couldn't sleep, 3) Talk about ghosts, 4) Prank call pizza places, 5) Accidentally spill an entire bottle of blue nail polish on the carpet and hide it with a pillow."
4355,"What I don't understand is, why can't they just admit they are anime girl cosplayers? I mean okay their costumes tend to suck.  But that just means they are NOT VERY GOOD anime girl cosplayers. 

I would not have the slightest problem with a group of self-confessed anime cosplayers having a little anime cosplay orgy. I wouldn't want to read about it, but okay, dudes, have fun with your thing. Have your little anime cosplay fetish subculture, it's cool. (Not cool in the Fonz sense obviously, cool in the who cares sense.)

It's them claiming to be actual women that causes all the problems. Taking over women's spaces and trying to bully actual women into ""validating"" their fetish. 

 They're basically the same fucking thing as furries but with anime girls instead of cartoon animals. Why can't they just be like furries and be happy in their their own creepy little subculture and stop trying to destroy women's rights?"

4406,"No. Men do not see each other's dick a lot. I was in a locker rooms as an athlete for many years. I can remember ONE guy in 8 years who walked around naked and he was fucking crazy. Coach made him stop too. Everyone else gets their shit on and off as fast as possible. If there was time to kill, like after school but before a game, we hung out in our school issues shorts, not in jock straps or towels like you'd see in lighthearted football movies. For the most part, you're actually on a changing time crunch because coaches want you on the field to practice, not playing grab ass in the locker room. 

I honestly don't think I've ever seen a penis IRL that wasn't in my family. Even then it is extenuating circumstances like having to help my brother who had broken his leg bathe or when he got wasted and puked all over himself so we stripped him naked and he slept in the bathtub. Now I have a son who is under 2 and I of course change his diaper and bathe him often. 

As far as toilets go... that's a good way to start a fight. I know I would be pretty upset if the guy next to me went out of his way to look at my dick. We don't just whip them out and keep them out as soon as we cross the threshold to the bathroom."

Projection and a lack of socialization. If you're an incel and your entire existence consists of playing videogames and jerking off, you get this idea in your head that life would be beautiful if you could just find that special girl who's also into videogames and sex.

4423,"No we don’t. The only times I’ve “compared breast size” is when I’m borrowing clothes from a friend/sharing clothes and we go “oh that probably won’t fit because your boobs are bigger, I won’t fill it out”. Never in my entire life of being a woman (and one in a sorority, at that lmao) and being around women have we taken our tops off and compared breasts."
4424,"I imagine it's pretty common for girls to mentally compare their breast size to their friends' breast size, because teenagerhood is all about being painfully self-conscious about the ways your body is changing and the ways you're different from your peers. But actually holding your breasts next to your friend's breasts and seeing whose are bigger . . . I'm not going to claim no teenage girls have ever done this, but it's really, really not a standard girlhood experience. And comparing ""clitty"" sizes is just not a thing. At all. Although maybe it's normal *male* behavior, because we all know that ""clitty"" means ""dick"" here."

4446,How do people even reach this conclusion?
4447,nah you’re just fetishizing children my guy
4448,Having a weird and creepy fantasy to jerk off to doesn’t make it real
4449,"A title from one of your post says ""Only been on E for a couple of days. Still have a constant hard on."" It's obvious that you fetishize being a woman and know nothing about it"
4450,I sincerely hope this is sarcasm D:
4451,"Oh so you're the one who originally posted this. Yeah no. As evidenced by all those downvotes. The majority of women do not have their first sexual experiences at sleepovers. Not even ""comparing breasts"". Stop sexualizing our childhoods like this. It's disgusting."

Stop projecting your fetishes on women and young girls"

>Don't lie. We all know that most girls have their first sexual experiences during their slumber parties. First kiss and so forth. 

I'm going to leave this up (and even [archive](http://archive.is/xiezx) it) because it's such a glorious example of the way that some transbians seem totally unable to distinguish between women's realities and their own sex fantasies."
4455,"absolutely not. i had a few sleepovers growing up with my best friend and we just played in her backyard with her dog, picked oranges, and ran around. Oh yeah and a little bit of video games."
4456,lol imagine actually believing this
4457,"Absolutely not. I’ve attended a fair number of slumber parties and can assure you mine were centered on eating candy and junk food, watching horror movies, and staying up late to talk all night long. Sex as a topic was treated like a social practice we didn’t understand and were trying to puzzle through, not as anything arousing. Very much a “omg, his penis was hard!! Ewwwwwww. That’s so gross!!”"
4458,No.
4459,"What a degenerate.

I think I'm one of the few boys who got to go to one of these slumber parties. This was in the summer of 1986. It was me, the girl I had a crush on, her younger sister, and a few other girls at our apartments.

What did we do?

Her mom went to Foster Farms(local restaurant like KFC in the 80s) and got us BBQ chicken and spuds, rented us a couple scary movies, and my contribution was bringing a bag of Now n Laters, Jolly Ranchers, and chick o sticks.

We talked and listened to the radio in their bedroom, played the board game Life, had dinner, watched those movies, watched MTV, and I think they fell asleep around midnight. I slept on the couch and watched TV until I fell asleep. I woke up around 6 am or so, went to their mom's room, and told her I was leaving. I walked back to my apartment.

Notice what was missing from this story? Your sick fantasies. Even with a boy in the equation, a boy who at 11 had sex on the brain and dealing with a foot fetish, nothing happened.

Any time I hear songs like Robert Palmer's Addicted to Love, Peter Catera's Glory of Love, I think of those times.

Your pedo fantasies do not match the realities of these parties."
4460,"What the fuck. Just cause you fantasize about female children having “first sexual experiences” together doesn’t make it true. You are disgusting. We played video games, ate candy, rode bikes. Went to the park, watched movies at night, had popcorn and soda. 

I had sleepovers that includdd girls who later came out as lesbian and there still wasn’t any kissing or sexual experiences because we were fucking KIDS. 

Stop fetishizing female children. Stop. Stop. Stay away from little girls."
4461,Ummm no
4462,This has to be a troll
4463,"Jesus Christ you're serious. Or you know you're full of shit, but you're deliberately sexually harassing that poster by making  up sexualised lies about her to make her uncomfortable.  Gross."
4464,"I'm **actually** a girl, unlike you, and nobody ever kissed at any sleepover I went to."
4465,Normal people seek privacy for their intimate and sexual activities. Really not everybody is an exhibicionst or a swinger.
4466,Jesus fucking Christ. This is so wrong and sick in so many levels. It just shows how little your knowledge of womanhood is.

4477,"Right! I'd have been running for the door if someone starting getting weird at a sleepover. 
I think these guys conflict what they see in porn and what happens in real life, so they try to turn real life into what they fantasize about. Some fantasies (especially the sick ones) should not be acted on."

4490,Yes. You HAD your girlhood. We did not. We where denied our youth. And here we are trying to reclaim it. And what do we get? harassment. My post quoted and me bullied. Really mature.
4491,I've been in locker rooms full of guys for many years as a former athlete. We were naked changing around each other and never compared dick size. Dude is a lunatic.
4492,"We never compared. Why would we? We have eyes. It’s obvious when one girl is a DD and another is an A. There might have been discussion about how someone wishes they were bigger/smaller but it was in passing and once we were older (say 16), just general discussion about bodies and not sexual in any way."
4493,boys don't compare dick sizes. this guy's just a pervert

4495,Too true

4501,Why do they continue to believe this nonsense? It’s just so ridiculous and gross. 🤢
4502,"To my friends and I, sex was a topic we were interested in, in a curious ""I wonder what it's like"" kind of way. And even though a few of us were bi- or homosexual, experimenting with each other never came up."
4503,[removed]
4504,That's such an 80s sleep over lol... I'm a guy that got to go to a bunch of girls sleep overs because my best friend lived next door and had a bunch of sisters and step sisters. This was in the 90s and pretty much the same thing you described. Not until we got older did we even realize the possibility of sexual things could be done. These people just have a sexual fantasy of being and having sex with little kids.
4505,This sleepover sounds so wholesome and cute. I bet you had a great time.
4506,Read his post history. He's serious (-ly deranged)
4507,Lesbian first love doesn't happen in reality.
4508,nope. I'm a lesbian and i have NEVER heard of a gay or bi woman having her first sexual experiences during childhood group sleepovers.
4509,Bisexual here. Did not have my first sexual experience at a sleepover.
4510,A few people did but mostly everyone wanted to get home ASAP so they showered as soon as they got home
4511,"If they bother with genital mutilation, then yes, what you said is accurate. Most men who seek to colonize womanhood, however, have not had and will not have any kind of surgical disfigurement. So, whether or not a man is surgically altered, his dick, or whatever remains of it, is often referred to as a ""clitty."" Surgery or not, it is a term both wildly inaccurate and quite disgusting."
4512,"The idea that men masquerading as women via caricatures of femininity is offensive is basically the ""womanface"" argument. A lot of women feel offended that these men use incredibly sexist and/or pornified representations of women to define ""womanhood"". Womanface is akin to blackface, though obviously also substantially different."
4513,"It's a comparison to blackface, and a controversial comparison at that. Some women of color hate it, others think it's quite apt; personally, I agree with the comparison and have never read a compelling argument against it as it seems all the arguments against the comparison seek to eliminate a tremendous amount of women's history and suffering."
4514,"I feel that. It sucks. Also,  I'm sorry about what happened to you.  The ""oh fuck accidental creepbait, hope she doesn't get unwanted DMs"" concern was so strong that I forgot to even say that."
4515,"You realise this is #NotAllMen that you're doing. I find it really interesting, because I don't understand why men do this.

It's not just the men this sub is about. Women who post about this stuff in other places on Reddit get gross creepy PMs. Some of them take the risk anyway in support subreddits and whatnot, but it is a risk. It's only a small minority of men of course being that awful, but that doesn't make any difference to the woman who gets the messages. 

And I wasn't saying that to hate on men or generalise about them or anything, you know, I was saying it to a fellow woman so she'd know to protect herself.

I always feel like men who do this are annoyed because comments like that make men look bad and they feel defensive. Is that why you reacted that way? Genuinely asking, because so many men do this and I don't get it at all."

Nah bruh. You're one of those people generally unhappy people can look at to feel better about themselves, because maybe they haven't achieved all they wanted in life but at least they aren't *that.*"
4531,You have cumbrain. ☹️
4532,"The majority of women here are actually same-sex attracted, smart ass. Sleepovers are something little girls/boys and teens do, so they would be in the age range of around 8 to about 16 or so. 

And no, even lesbian and bisexual girls do not have a big orgy pile at slumber parties. We are able to be friends with other women without wanting to do anything sexual with them. The pedophilic fetishization of girls and young teens at slumber parties is a complete porn fantasy, and just shows that none of you will ever know what it’s like to grow up female."
4533,I'm a lesbian ya dick
4534,"You make a mockery of children who were actually denied childhood by abusive parents. You had a boyhood I presume. You're a man. And your fantasy of what girlhood is like sounds like an extremely typical male fetish. Maybe you're a troll but if not, you need to get a grip."
4535,"By the way, I spent a lot of my girlhood riding bicycles, climbing trees, stick sword fighting in the park, and doing sports. Yeah there were some typically feminine things too but girls growing up can do anything and it's still a girlhood. You have a weird porn fantasy of woman and girlhood."
4536,"Lmao, this fucking dramatic bullshit is just so hilarious. Of course you didn’t have a girlhood, because you’ve never been a girl or a woman."
4537,"Not sure if you're just trolling for giggles and harsh reaction. Either way I want to know why you'd think this sleepover tale is an actual part of girlhood?

 Let's play this out. Let's say I feel like you deserve to reclaim events from youth that you were denied. Will you be talking to any cis women who can describe the experience? Your reaction seems to show you're of the mindset that all women are lieing about our childhood. On a social media site with anonymity and no repercussions for us to say, ""dirty flirty shit happens at slumber parties"" but none of us are expressing that. Do you think that's because we're all in a huge conspiracy to rob you or is it maybe the truth?"
4538,"YOU 👏 WILL 👏 NEVER 👏 HAVE 👏 A 👏 GIRLHOOD 👏


You are a man!"
4539,"If you were really trying to to reclaim the youth that you never had, you would have actually set out to have a sleepover that the VAST MAJORITY of girls experienced. Maybe something in the realm involving nail polish, popcorn, makeup, movies, pizza, dance parties, ice cream, pillow fights, braiding, etc. 

What you had was an orgy sleepover. One obviously meant for adults. It's fine. You do you. But don't try labeling this as a way to reconnect with your childhood. Because nothing you experienced was tied to adolescence."
4540,"The disgusting orgy thing you describe isn’t anything approaching female childhood. Stop fantasizing about little girls, you sick fuck."
4541,"Pretty good troll account, not gonna lie"
4542,"Girlhood doesn't include orgies, freak"
4543,"Because you're not a girl. You will never know what it's like to be a girl. You have hundreds of real women telling you you're wrong about our childhood experiences - but you still insist on turning them sexual because you have a massive hard on for ""being a girl"".

No, you are trying to reclaim OUR youth as your own.  

There is a reason we had our girlhood and you did not.  It's because you were not, are not, and never will be a girl. Or a woman.


You're not even a real trans woman.  You're just a fetishist. You don't long for a real female experience.  You fantasize about being a caricature of a woman.  And you act out that fantasy in the most crude, awkward, ridiculous way possible.


Also, you're a creepy pedophile. I hope you never have contact with children.  Go sell crazy somewhere else, we're all full up here."

4548,you had your male childhood. because you're male. you weren't denied shit you goddamn pervert
4549,You were denied access to predating on children? Thank god.
4550,Im honestly scared by how batshit insane you are. Do you ever have fleeting moments of clarity in between your drug binges and absolutely fucked worldview?
4551,But your idea of girlhood is so sexual and fetishized. It’s gross.

4559,"Yep. Can confirm as well. I’m bisexual and I never had any sexual experiences during my sleepovers. We just watched movies, played board games and ate food lol. Nothing sexual at all"
4560,"&#x200B;

I remember, not from personal experience, but from my sister's friend, that she was goaded into watching hentai and talking explicitly sexual things with her friend, and she still goes to therapy for it. They were both girls, around the age of 13 iirc.

So I can also confirm that, no, it's not normal for childhood sleepovers."

So a lesbian orgy is not lesbianism? What?

And ah, so ""slumber parties"" ""max out"" at 14 - what does that even mean lol? So they're later called something else or what? Cause you know, it keeps happening at older ages too, regular sleepovers or orgies especially, so yeah what a confused argument lol

> Little girl orgies only exist in twisted male fantasies.

Many people already commit sin at 14 or even younger, so I'm not sure who you're trying to convince with this nonsense lol - however the weird OP didn't even say anything about 14, so you're really confused about everything here lolmao"
4571,"Retweet times a million. Any sexist attempt to recreate a slumber party of middle school would've been cringy, but not as a bad as an orgy repurposed as some woke girlhood reclamation."
4572,"Your comment reminds me of a fragment from Diary of a Wimpy Kid (i think it comes from that book, but im not sure) when the main character was angry at his friend who kept saying ""do you want to play after school"", because at their age he should be saying ""do you want to hang out"", even tho their activities remained exactly the same as year or two befire"
4573,Noo. Lol. My son had his friends over all night long after 8th grade.
4574,"Yeah, they changed. In high school we had mixed gender groups that would crash overnight together. And we didn't call them slumber parties."

4579,"Oh, so it is the petty defensiveness thing. And of course you have zero insight into it or into yourself. 

The difference is the chances of this woman getting harassing messages is not low, it's high. A small number of men doing the behaviour does not mean a small risk for the woman. The chance of your buddy getting false-rape-accused or whatever is fucking miniscule.

Any man who can read a comment like that from one woman to another and his primary emotional response isn't empathy for the women but butthurt about his own ego, is exactly the kind of man who is the problem.  

In conclusion, fuck your #notallmen. Women don't need to dance around saying ""certain shitty men"" every time we warn each other about stuff."
4580,Do you really think lesbian and bisexual teenage girls just have orgies at female slumber parties? Really?

I'm trying to think about what specifically pisses me off about it, and the best way to describe it is that women say that shit to each other, I feel like we can define what that looks like to each other even though there's no criteria, and we mean it as a compliment, (some use as an) insult, or joking around... But from a man, it is unequivocally never ever anything but a huge judgement based on their definition of what a ""slut"" looks like, and it's always related to how they can probably slither their way into our beds, why they should ""stay away from"" us, and often a ""justification"" (whether it's said outright or implied) for sexual assault. And that justification permeates society to the point where ""what were you wearing?"" is an actual question women and girls are asked after a sexual assault, totally blaming the victim. And here this motherfucker is using it as something fun and freeing, when the rest of us have to think about where we're going, who's going to be there, who to stay away from, where our girls in our group are at all times, because dressing ""slutty"" carries a lot of risk. Not to mention, the consideration and reconsideration as to whether we do ""look"" slutty, and asking our friends ""do I look like a slut? Is my skirt too short?"", which is entirely subjective, but it's still considered a bad thing. They don't get to have a positive attitude toward looking like a slut, when they are the reason we have to pause hard to enjoy the same feelings"

If everyone was allowed to push their fetishes on the public with immunity, we’d be sharing the dog park with furries and submissives on leashes. We’d have to sit next to someone at the movies loudly snacking on a bucket of their own shit.  And we’d have to be on the lookout for people crawling under our tables at Wendy’s trying to get a sniff of our toes.  /s


I’m all for having freedom to enjoy whatever kink floats your boat. But keep it in your own private pond. 


PS:  I have nothing against actual transgender people. These people exist, and deserve the same respect as anyone else. It’s the TiMs as fetishists that piss me off."
4634,A 120 year old woman dressed like that would still look better than insane grandpa over here.
4635,"I haven’t heard a women in real life describe her style as slutty. i think it’s one of those things they pick up from the subreddits where men role play as woman.

Plus the only time i’ve seen women dress really revealing is when they are going to the club or dancing which is appropriate for the occasion. Other then that 95% of women dress casually for everyday life. you know, like real people."

4639,"Well, it's a fetish. And then on top of it the thing is they are MEN. They look like it so if they aren't leaning incredibly hard into makeup and skirts and a stereotype they read as men (and still do obviously all dressed up by virtue of women not usually wearing stuff like that) 

So, real women can basically wear whatever we want baggy or tight, not put on make up or do our hair real big and still be considered women. And probably look better than a dolled up TIM. 🤷‍♀️"
4640,"Even young women who dress ""slutty"" generally don't wear leather mini skirts and fetish boots to the grocery store.  AGP men don't get off on picturing themselves as a woman, but rather as a slut.  Indeed, at this point I find it offensive to call it AGP.  It should be called ASP."
4641,It disgusts me that these men involve everyone around them in their fetish without consent. Remember when they just showed people their penises in public and were (occasionally) arrested for public exhibitionism? Well now they can just put on some plastic stiletto boots and a shitty dress from Forever 21 and they’re a protected population. Mind boggling.

Who wants to be some 25+ year old crone? It's not sexy to be a middle-aged businesswoman in a pantsuit or an exhausted single mother wearing sweatpants while shopping at Wal-Mart.

With AGPs they're trying to LARP as their ideal sex partner. So most will beeline for either a stereotypical teenager or a quirky nerdy college woman persona. Many will name themselves after a sister, actress, etc, like Contrapoints naming himself after Natalie Portman."
4644,"\> It's so fucking obvious that this is a costume for sexual gratification and not an attempt to genuinely change into the other sex and take on their role and typical behaviour.

Yup. If it was the latter, you'd see the occasional reasonable outfit. I don't know women's fashion well, but I know enough to see one hell of a variety -- my woman's closet is evidence enough. And despite all this variety of outfits and styles, what do TiMs pick? The valentine's day lingerie. Something slutty/trashy so that if it wasn't for the linebacker shoulders and lantern jaw, you would think ""yes this is a cheaper hooker."" 

It's never normal clothes. Never professional attire. It's always that cheesy bedroom gimmick shit. That has a time and place, but you can't wear just that and expect to be taken seriously. You'll never see a TiM rocking the hoodie/leggings because that's just normal. How are you gonna pop a boner in women's panties over that?!"
4645,That’s because they have a mental illness and confuse “gender identity “ with what is actually a fetish.
4646,Ok. Just to let you know. 50 or 60-year-olds are NOT seniors!! :)

4654,"Omfg the nipple thing pisses me off SO BADLY. They have them too! Women can be comfortable and do things and that has nothing to do with these gross men. I hate wearing bras. I don’t need to wear them, but then there’s always the “hyuh hyuh hyuh, is it cold in here” comment. Fuck off, Jimmy!"
4655,"Im not talking about looks, im talking about how itd be received by the general public."
4656,"No definitely not. I meant more in the context of, like me telling my best friend ""omg you look so slutty, love it!"" When she is feeling herself and showing off some of her fabulous self. But I've never really heard any actual woman be be like ""I dress like a slut"". In my experience, women use it with each other situationally, and although the definition (whatever that is) has definitive roots directly based on sexism and patriarchal standards, it's still something some women use with each other but (usually) don't mean it in a judgey or offensive way. To hear a man be proud of looking that way is infuriating. Like I said, I cannot quite verbalize my feelings right on that word and the way it's used, but I do know that it's not ok for a man to proud of this, when they'll never have to suffer the consequences of it. Also, young girls are always taught not to dress ""slutty"" by their parents, dress codes in schools outline what girls can't wear, and their examples always insinuate what may be considered a ""slutty"" outfit. The list is usually long, and incredibly restrictive, and so many times, girls get in trouble for something inappropriate at school because one teacher thinks something is too tight, or too short, etc, whereas others wouldn't. Girls who develop early might always look ""slutty"" no matter what they wear, because compared to their peers, the clothes simply fit differently, which isn't their fault. I remember when I was young, I was tall and thin, grew like a maniac for a while, but settled down after like 10th grade. During the time I was maybe 15-17, every dress I wore was really short, because my waist size was ""typical"" for my age, but my height wasn't. All the pants were tight because although I wasn't all that tall, I was super thin, and usually the really small waist sizes come with really long inseams. My mom used to say ""you're probably gonna get in trouble for wearing that, but just tell the principal that you can't help growing, that everything is going to make you look slutty and ask him if he wants you to wear pajamas every day, because that's against the dress code too"". So for me, being a woman now allows us to own that word, define it for ourselves and use it positively because we've gone through the process of it being the first thing we think of before we leave as a bad thing. To hear a man be proud of it, without the exhausting experience with what that word means and how it can define a whole woman negatively makes me mad; they haven't earned any right to say it in any way"

And no, you are not ovulating and no, you will never be, you will never be a woman or get pregnant. You will always be a dirty man with a crossdressing fetish."

Now, some women can get hyperemesis gravidarium. What that essentially means is while a baby is inside my wife she is nauseous, vomiting 3-4 times a day, for the past 7.5 months. Nothing has helped her, and all she is, is miserable.

When I was wearing them I would take them off immediately when I got home. But I can understand why women wear them. Many women aren’t comfortable with their nipples showing through their clothing. I think it can be more comfortable for women that have very large breasts because bras help secure them but that’s just my guess. My breasts tend to hurt when they are in motion so I can only imagine very large breasts hurting/being uncomfortable even more when in motion. 

A 14 year old male on the other hand that is completely flat chested in all sense of the word has absolutely no need for a bra and encouraging them to wear one is just plain creepy."

Have you ever noticed how there's so much videogames and anime in the Trans scene?

As a kid, I was involved in five different ""scenes:""

5) I was a Catholic Altar Boy

4) I was a boy scout

3) I was into comic books

2) I was into the 'warez' scene, basically pirating video games 

1) I was into anime

Far and away, the videogame and anime scenes were completely overrun with pedos. And I think that's probably a big part of the reason that they're so prominent in the Trans scene.

Basically it would have seemed completely fucking weird if grown-ass adults were hanging out with fourteen year old boys. But because the adults said they were ""huge fans of anime"" all the teen boys were just like *""ok, whatever.""*

And there was so much creepy / weird shit going on. Like middle aged men inviting teen boys over to their homes to ""watch anime."" Grown men taking three teen boys to anime conventions because the boys were too young to drive.

All of this shit was completely normalized in the anime scene."

The nipple thing is a tough one. It’s like people shouldn’t care but at the same time men are the worst. So. I’ve been trying to go for thicker fabrics and getting pasties. 


I’m just rambling as a woman recognizing her past pro-bra talk comes from rationalizing misogyny. It does take getting use to obviously, but it’s hard to deny that braless is far more comfortable.

The entire attraction to it is the *knowledge* that you're not supposed to like it. It's a story as old as time- people will be drawn to things for no reason other than that they're not supposed to like it. 


If not that, then they *are* just mentally deficient. There's nothing morally, ethically or logically consistent about wanting to form a sexual relationship with a relative so that you can bring an inbred child with a strong genetic predisposition for a host of problems into the world. 


A very simple ethical instrument is to simply ask yourself what would happen if *everyone* did it. Logically, if everyone did it and the human race suffered no ill effects, it's probably not *that* bad from an ethical standpoint. If everyone did it and it caused problems, it's probably unethical.


Now realize that if everyone engaged in incest it'd trigger an extinction event. Anyone who takes it beyond, 'tee hee I loved Game of Thrones!' or 'well duh, it's not like I'm *actually* going to do it' is probably mentally unstable. Or outright sociopathic. A major reason incest is illegal in most of the US is because of how frequently it dovetails with an inherently abusive relationship across generations. It's not typically cousins fucking, it's often the abusive uncle or the mother who's turned their son into their new husband. Which is to say, it's rape."

5011,"Your last paragraph is, like, half of all relationships in human history.

In ancient history, humanity was mostly small tribes. You hooking up with your cousin was pretty much the norm. Brother sister stuff wasn’t uncommon, you did what you had to do to bear a child, since that was basically your duty (if you were a woman) to grow the group. Many tribes had some fucked up traditions too, like one in Africa or maybe Aboriginal Australia (I think, can’t remember the name and I really don’t want to google this) had the tradition that when a girl had her first period, and was therefore fertile, she would be impregnated by her _grandfather_ to pass on his genes.

As these tribes became settled civilizations, cousin-fucking was still the norm but direct father/daughter/mother/son/brother/sister became less common because it was less “necessary” and the group was much larger, so you had more options. But family ties and arranged marriages were ubiquitous. Though incestuous rape was still _extremely_ common. Like, heart-breakingly so. 

Even up until the modern era, first or second cousin marriages were super, super common. Most people lived in what we would consider now to be rural communities. We all make fun of Alabama because it still does that. 

So your 3rd paragraph about what if _everyone_ did it doesn’t really stand, because, well, for most of human history, pretty much everyone _did_ do it. First cousin marriages weren’t even something to bat an eye at until 150 or so years ago. Nowadays that’s pretty taboo. 

Make no mistake, I’m not advocating for incest. And thinking back on how things used to be, especially from the perspective of adolescent girls, is pretty sad. I’m mainly just trying to say that, before the information era, incest was a _lot_ more common than most people want to believe.

But real quick, a note about inbreeding and why incest wasn’t as detrimental as we imagine. If you don’t care about genetics and don’t want to read anymore about incest, you can just stop here.

———————

Incest itself doesn’t actually have any negative effects. The inbreeding issue arises from the fact that most people have some negative mutations or alleles in their genomes. And siblings probably all have that copy from a parent. But if you only have one bad copy, it’s generally fine. The problem with incest is, if these bad genes are present, the chance an incestuous child gets 2 copies of the shit genes skyrockets because both parents had a copy, while random mating drastically lowers the chance both parents have a copy of the bad gene.

And as humanity advances technologically, shit genes aren’t filtered out as much because we have the medical skill and social obligation to care for and help these people. So the risk of inbreeding issues from incest rise as people accumulate more and more potentially bad genes. Just think of all the people with glasses nowadays. Bad sight genes are no longer a detriment because we can mitigate the effects.

But, in theory, if you had a couple of genetically “pristine” siblings who had no negative genes, including silent single pair mutations, these two could create an incest chain forever until natural mutation rate caused spontaneous issues. 

In other species, like crops and pets and work animals such as horses, our strongest specimens were usually _incredibly_ inbred, because we selected for good traits and then bred them with the parents who had the traits, then mated those offspring until the desired traits were very strongly represented. 

———————

I’m sorry for writing so much about a taboo topic. The first half was just historical clarification and as a biochemist I kinda felt the urge to mention that “inbreeding isn’t inherently genetically detrimental”  for the second half.

But in the end, human incest is still morally wrong."

That‘s not a very useful tool. Left handelndes developed precisely because not everyone had it. That is to say, the advantage of left handedness lies in being a minority trait. 

Similarly, incest isn‘t a problem as long as long as it‘s not exclusively practiced. Cousins marrying cousins is a practice as old as time, and didn‘t cause issues. Until the European royals took it too far my practicing it exclusively. Direct relatives carry considerate risk form the get go, though.

5022," First cousin marriages in Pakistani communities leading to 'appalling' disabilities among children

Baroness Flather, a cross-bench peer, says it is 'absolutely appalling' that    first cousin marriages in Pakistani communities are leading to 'so much    disability among children'   

Couples who are getting married should be  forced to have a DNA test first to ensure they are not cousins amid  growing concern about [incest within Pakistani communities](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/7957808/700-children-born-with-genetic-disabilities-due-to-cousin-marriages-every-year.html), Britain's first Asian peer has claimed. 

 Baroness Flather, a former Tory who now sits as a cross-bencher, said  in the House of Lords that it is ""absolutely appalling"" that first  cousin marriages in Pakistani communities are leading to ""so much  disability among children"". 

She  said: ""There are a lot of first-cousin marriages in certain communities,  particularly among Pakistanis who come from the Pakistani Kashmir area.  We know so much about DNA now, but there is so much disability among  the children, which is absolutely appalling. 

 ""You go to any such family and there will be four or five children, at  least one or two of whom will have some disability. That is absolutely  unacceptable, and if we cannot do anything about it, is it fair to the  children?"" 

Baroness Flather, a  former barrister who was born in the Pakistani city of Lahore when it  was part of India, said: ""Never mind the parents — it is not fair to the  children that they should be allowed to become disabled because of a  social practice. It is a social practice which does not belong in  today’s age, when we know so much about DNA. There should at least be  some rule which says that you must have a DNA examination before your  marriage can be registered."" 

 First-cousin marriages, which are are legal in the UK, are practised  within Britain’s Pakistani community, as well as among some Arab and  African families.[  Medical data previously suggested that while British Pakistanis were  responsible for 3 per cent of all births, they accounted for 30 per cent  of British children born with a genetic illness](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/4014743/Warning-over-births-to-first-cousin-marriages.html)."

I'm afraid AGP being a neurodevelopmental disorder has to be proven, Nor are individuals with autism allowed to commit sexual harassment because it affirms their identity.

I don't consider not suppressing disabled children on par with sanctioning a man's misappropriation  of what being female is like   -  I think only a very self-loathing  man or a hyperbolic trans activist would say that.

>Feminists try to explain current social dynamics by some conspiracy against women. I think the problem is more deeper.

I agree to an extent, but the nonchalance with women have been trampled to uplift a subset of men and their sexual fixations to the point of defunding shelters has got to put an end to ""male = expendable, woman = valuable"" canards for good (unless it's an emotional belief, of course). Reminder about female infanticide and [human trafficking.](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/01/1029912)

Just because you're valued for your use doesn't mean your needs and desires are considered at all. I thought that was why men complained about the draft (which hasn't existed in most Western countries for quite a while), why workers have to negotiate working conditions instead of getting treated humanely from the get-go, or, conversely, why lesbians complain about the cotton ceiling."
5025,"indeed, of course. but to my understanding, while it is MUCH more dangerous than a regular conception for the child, it's 2+ generations of inbreeding where suppression of problem genes becomes more and more pronounced."

>I'm afraid AGP being a neurodevelopmental disorder has to be proven

Do you think that normal males without developmental problems can develop AGP?  I don't consider atypical sexual interest due to porn escalation as a paraphilia.

>And the criteria has been diluted to meaninglessness, like many mental health diagnosis apparently (such is the state of psychology today)

Yeah, diagnostic critera are fuzzy, nevertheless there is a trend towards deinstitutionalization  of the psychiatry. It means that a lot of people with atypical brain and psyche live in the general community.  My point is that   society needs to  ""play along""  to some degree  with such people if we decided to integrate them into society, also there is   accumulation of such  people in the western countries.  Also i don't confuse social integration with granting of special rights. Autistic agp doesn't  have a  special right to chase women, but he has a right to receive hormonal treatment and wear appropriate female clothes (not fetish gear) in social settings if he likes to do it.  It is my  humble opinion and vision, i don't pretend that it is right."

5080,"Many of them are already doing that! They just want the option of being able to get real lesbians. A HUGE majority of them have the ""dickgirl""/trans fetish so they have no problem chasing each other. But of course some of them will still demand lesbians be into them.

5170,I’m sure the gynecologist wonders the exact same thing.
5171,"> What exactly is the gynecologist supposed to do for him?

Yaniv is a sadist who gets sexual gratification from forcing women to play with his dick. 

Yaniv has figured out that as a male, he cannot force a prostitute to play with his dick, and if that's what he's into, he'll have to pay good money for a professional. And let's be realistic here, even prostitutes would turn down a guy like that.

So Yaniv's figured out, that by transitioning, he can force people to do this. And that gives him a boner."
5172,Can confirm! :) personally I wish he continues
5173,"I don't think he's trolling, I really think he gets off on this.

But I DO agree that he's probably our greatest ally. Nobody has distilled the ridiculousness of the trans movement like Yaniv has."

5175,"They don't care. They know how ridiculous it is, but that's irrelevant to them -- they just want a fight. They want to be 'oppressed' they want to be a victim. I'm in endo and all my TiM patients are like tapdancing on a landmine. Nothing you say will please them, it's best to just rx whatever the hell they want and nod along because anything else is potentially career ending. And oddly enough the female to male patients simply want advice with testosterone and estrogen blockers, no drama, no problems. Amazing how it works, isn't it?"

1) 70.3 % of gynecology students are women

2) Yaniv likes forcing women to play with his dick and balls

5201,"Not true though, I have seen videos. Him speaking to a council meeting or something, in a red velvet dress. 🙄 Him saying shit about an immigrant who was sitting literally next to him. Him in his mobility scooter that he scammed the taxpayers out of, flipping out at a journalist ... at least two of those.

The TiMs are so damn time consuming it greatly impacts my ability to interact with other patients due to how much time they consume, how difficult they are and how much liability we face. I frequently leave the room to consult with colleagues extensively to figure out the best way to respond to simple questions without being vulnerable to lawsuits or offending their fragile egos."
5207,When i was an intern in a hospital as part of my paramedic training the general rule of thumb was for waiting people in the ER “If they have the ability to complain they have nothing to complain about.” And i find that also applies to a lot of “regular” patients

5256,"No, I'm a man, but I think you're definitely on to something. TiMs are faaaaar more aggressive with women. They're a pain in the ass with me, but it's more of an entitled ""I can do your job better than you, give me everything I demand and if you don't coddle me you're getting sued"" type of attitude. With women, it's more predatory and overtly sexual. They seem to take a sick pleasure in making women uncomfortable hence why I am completely dedicated to keeping them out of female safe spaces. For folks who talk a big game about wanting to be women, they sure seem to treat real women like trash."
5257,Dear god i hope not
5258,"Of course not. But they are doing this shit in private. Threatening our safety, ability to say ""no"" and us and them knowing they can cry ""transphobe"" and we lose our jobs, friends, status.

Finally it's being out in the open so everyone else can see it besides us radfems.

I think it's safe to assume his employer figured out a way to get rid of him. He was customer-facing, and that's got to be a difficult thing to explain.

Nowadays they spend all their time blogging about how they *""were always a woman""* and about videogames. Considering how long they've been out-of-work, I think it's safe to assume they got themselves on permanent disability for some reason or another, and they're going to spend the rest of their lives doing nothing, while my tax dollars pay for it.

The depressing thing isn't just that I pay for their lifestyle. It's also that this was a productive and smart person, who's now spending 24x7 on videogames and blogging. 

And I **love** videogames. I'd love to do that too. But I wouldn't feel right, taking money from everyone else, because my fetish was more important than anything else in the world."

i stumbled upon porn at a young age (was given free roam of the internet and safesearch wasn't as good back then) and thought it was weird/gross/upsetting - the women looked and sounded like they were in pain, so how could that have been a good thing?

in my teens i started using tumblr, and back then it was full of porn and i got used to seeing it. but even then, it did not interest me at all, any orientation or fetish. i just never viewed porn as anything but weird, offputting or harmful, and it makes me wonder why i didn't seem to fall for it like many people do. i don't think i'm ""special"" by any means, in fact i thought it was normal to not like that kind of stuff (especially when you're young). what changed between when i was a minor and the present?"

5317,"I got myself out of that one after I got introduced to porn when I was fucking 10. Even years later that shit fucks up your view of sex and relationships and takes time to deprogram yourself of thinking porn as reality and getting rid of disgusting kinks. It really is a cancer for young dudes who really don't know better and when they do know better, it's already too late."
5318,I would seek out abusive men when I first started having sex at 15 and I am really certain this has to do with being an isolated teenager who fell into porn and libfem tumblr blogs posting “choke me daddy” shit

As you can see [here](https://terfisaslur.com), and [here](https://imgur.com/nwP0XtU), you'll find copious examples of why it is considered to provoke sex-based violence. You likely won't look in earnest based on your profile, and will likely use this as an a-ha screenshot for your mates, but I'm linking you in case you honestly care."
5332,It is so insidious that the people promoting this abuse and grooming young girls to accept it are the ones calling themselves feminist nowadays. In a lot of ways it seems like the world is a worse place nowadays for young girls than in my mom’s pre-internet childhood
5333,I’m in this and don’t like it
5334,I really cringe thinking about the ideas I had as a teenager. I really thought we didn’t need feminism and that feminists were fun ruining prudes. And then eventually I became a libfem. I would have never thought I would make the progression to radical feminism as an adult because as a teenager I was the one calling people swerf and terf lol
5335,"What country are you from? Because your phrasing on that was odd. Age of consent is different from someone being actually mature enough to fully understand. Age of consent laws are there to protect teens who want to have sex with each other. In some countries, they put the age of consent as young as 13. That doesn't mean that a 13 year old should be looking at porn."
5336,I disagree plenty of trans fairies- !
5337,"Because the title said he was a minor. I thought that being AGP was generally a midlife crisis response and ""trans is more acceptable than being gay so I'll go with that"" was generally the depressed teenage boy response.

I learned that from this sub, but if it's not generally true than I will update my info."
5338,"Same. It disturbs me how blindly affirming the vast majority of media and online discussions I came across were (wrt sex and healhy relationships).

I was also that way about feminism! I was happy to prove myself as a cool girl by laughing at 'those crazy feminists' because 'we dont need it here'. Same, I agreed with gender ideology because I didn't give it a second glance. I blindly agreed because it seemed like the right thing to do and being the B in LGBT surely it was only my responsibility to do so."
5339,"Most likely the USA, I think Indiana because 16 is age of consent"
5340,"Historically, AGP has been a midlife crisis thing in that AGPs generally transitioned later in life. The fetish itself is typically present from adolescence. It's not that the interest materializes at 40; rather, there's a long period of time where the person can restrict the fetish to sexual situations or sporadic cross-dressing, and only feels the need/has the ability to transition much later. 

The general consensus in this sub (which I share) is that AGPs are transitioning earlier because trans visibility puts the idea in their heads earlier, and because widespread availability of porn (and especially sissy porn) accelerates the fetish more quickly. Like earlier AGPs, they come into the fetish at the same time (puberty); unlike earlier AGPs, the gap between fetish and transition is much smaller.

Without more context, it's not clear whether the kid in the OP is AGP or anything else. But age alone isn't a great way to tell either in this day and age."
5341,That makes a lot of sense.  Thanks for taking the time to write that out. I do appreciate it.
5342,"Do they realize you can just have normal sex? You don't need to be berated and beat during sex or do that to someone else lol. 

Of course they don't because they're whole perception of being a woman is based off badly written porn or anime that is made by men for other men, as well as their whole livelihoods are based off kink. 

How do they expect people to take them seriously lol"

Shocking! I’m astonished that these “women” have somehow hit the _male_ fantasy right on the head!! It’s always been so difficult for me to contend with but they just embrace it!! So women.

5382,"That's what scared the shit out of me, when I met people in the 'kink scene.' When I started to attend their meetups with my wife, I'd expected that the whole point of the meetups was basically a screening process, where we'd get to find out where the orgy was. Like, *I thought the whole point of being in the kink scene was to have sex.*

But NOOOOOOO

Once I actually hung out with these people, I learned that 95% of the dudes have ruined their dicks. The 2nd time I got invited to one of their parties, this dude offers me a giant Viagra, the size of a horse pill. I'd never seen Viagra in my life, and on top of that, there were a bunch of naked women there and I'm thinking *""why do you need viagra dude?!""*

Got to learn that they're ALL like that. Dudes who've done every kinky thing they could ever imagine and now they're just numb."

5396,"The T latched on to the Lesbian and Gay Movement when they saw how successful we were at obtaining a number of significant rights in states across the country and even a couple at the Federal level for LGB people. Having gained those rights, leaders at the top LG organizations decided to advocate for the T when previously they had done much to keep them at arm’s length. I lived through these times, was an activist, had a friend at the top of two of the leading LG advocacy organizations in America. This is how it happened. It’s important to be accurate about LGB history because Ts are rewriting it."
5397,"Just because you are neither butch nor femme nor do not wish to dress dapper or wear lipstick and high heels doesn’t make the Butch Femme life or community bullshit. 

It DOES make it none of your business that other people feel this way, dress this way, form partnerships this way because it expresses who they are. 

It’s just like your being lesbian expresses who you are and you can’t change to suit the crowd. And why should you change?

So live your best lesbian life and leave others to live theirs."
5398,"And that's your opinion, but blaming the lesbians who came before us for their culture, history, and identifying monikers as the reason a predatory cult attached itself to us is pretty shite, m8. 

I identify as femme, and am quite feminine. I'm a ballerina, I knit, I play the harp, I have hair to my knees. But exactly 0% of it is for men, especially TIMs, and 100% of it is because this is something I enjoy, which is what the word femme in the lesbian community was used \*for\*, until other communities started insisting that the word ""belonged to everyone queer"". Lesbian women who were feminine in their own right that had nothing to do with men or the male gaze."
5399,"Yeah, but neither is 'Black', and I, a white woman, still don't get to call myself Black- not just because it would be a useless descriptor for me, but *also* because it would be disrespectful. In a world without racism, me calling myself black would be merely 'odd' or 'delusional', in a world with racism, it veers into highly uncomfortable territory. As a self-descriptor, that word sure as hell belongs to Black people, no matter how tan I can become. For better or worse, some words are deeply associated with certain communities and sure, they can adapt to fit meanings outside of these communities, but the use of them by people who obviously do not fit any parameters of their original meaning is beyond strange, especially if there is a power imbalance or a degree of fetishisation involved."

Even when I am getting my period and I brush against a kinda sore nipple - it has never ever turned me on, just made me feel really uncomfortable cause my breasts HURT FFS. 

It's easy to sexualize what you do not understand and never ever will understand because you will never be that sex. It's so glaringly obvious that they take all their standards from shitty porn."

5458,"Actually, a lot of trans people do date other trans people. Sometimes it's probably at least partially because of limited options, but it's also about preference and individual attraction."

5461,"> We're rapidly becoming a society of manchildren and childish/immature women.

My wife was talking about this yesterday. About how she sees tons of women her age, who basically have no motivation to get married or have a boyfriend. She argued that women have generally pursued partners who were in a financial position that's equal or better than them. 

And with so many men stuck in this rut of videogames and porn, women simply aren't motivated to commit.

I have a friend who was about the same age, and ten years ago she was married. Her marriage ended about nine years ago. Since the end of her marriage, her income has tripled. (She used to be in the military and now works in the private sector.) She's cycled through a series of boyfriends over the last ten years, there's always someone new every year. And I wonder if this will just go on indefinitely, because she's never dated *anyone* who's made even half of what she makes. Last time I talked to her, she was complaining that she wanted to go on vacation but her boyfriend couldn't afford to pay for half, and she wasn't going to cover it. I'd be surprised if he's around for long."

5482,Saaaaaame
5483,Lol no a coworker told me that
5484,It's when guys have hormonal imbalances that cause them to have swollen breast tissue. So pretty much every MtF on female hormones has this condition.
5485,"""Proper breast tissue"". Sorry but no. No MtF has ""proper breast tissue"" which is why they also have smallish cone shaped looking breasts. If these female hormones you and the other MtF are taking cause ""proper breast tissue"" they would look like female breasts and yall wouldn't be getting breast implants so often."
5486,"Y'all don't even have the ligaments that we have in our breasts. Sorry but gynecomastia ""breasts"" are nothing like women's breasts."

Of course she does.

Oh look, another strawman!"

It's so strange. I'm also bilingual (Spanish is my native language), I've heard it's related to ambidexterity."
5499,Please show me all the MtF that have female looking breasts then please. You can go to any trans porn sub and you won't be finding any gynecomastia that looks like female breasts. And no it's not just older transitioners that are getting implants. Plenty of young MtF in their 20s are getting implants.
5500,Delusional
5501,🤷 I mean it's the same as gynecomastia in any male

5506,Oh nope! Ha. I thought I some how offended you. I’m irrationally afraid of pissing someone off and getting doxxed. Lol
5507,"Interesting! Oh no worries, you'll develop your skill with your right hand in no time if you practise. I think our brains are kinda fucked up in a sense, I dunno about you but my memory is always crap and I have issues putting two and two together, maybe it's related to being ambidextrous and bilingual."
