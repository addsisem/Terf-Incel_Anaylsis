In a recent hontrapoints video he said (and I'm paraphrasing through a quote I heard elsewhere because I don't make a habit of watching psuedointellectuals in fetish gear) if you can't handle being a man you should throw in the towel and become a woman. This quote really highlights the mindset that he and a lot of transcels have, that becoming a woman is giving up. He let the mask slip there for a moment and let it be known that he views being a man as taking an active role and being a woman is a passive role after they ""give up"". These people have a really warped world view, it's a shame that they have such a bully pulpit in academia where they can preach this nonsense."

Ended up trying to find an explanation to all this mess so she turned to religion. While studying theology  she ended up in a relationship with an abusive drughead( LUL this is redundant dont you think?).Not only didnt she find answer to her questions but new one started to sprout out.Left the asshole and ended up in a small village working as a barmaid (where she found my dad, an adorable dork of a gentle giant of a lumberjack ( i love my dad, he is what men should strive to be, honest, hardworker, full of love for other and gentle with everyone, especially kids and animals)). when she finally finished her theology master degree she started to work as a pastoral  agent, teaching religions to kids.

The notion of Progress has been so glorified, without any hard set definitions, that once something gets labelled as a Progressive cause, theres really no going back amongst that political faction.  They are not going to back down on this Trans thing, ever.  The majority of people who consider themselves Progressive are going to continue to support it, and most of those people will never have to deal with the ramifications.  For those of us who do support ""progressive"" things like basic human rights, but not this, we have lost.  I'm sorry to say, the game is over.  The Trans agenda has inserted itself so fully into the center of ""progressive"" politics that it is inextricable and unquestionable.  There is no more ""fixing this from within"", only a splintering of factions.  The fact that rightwing people also worry about this trans thing is a sign of that.  Youre both looking at the sames garbage fire, appalled for different reasons, but the fire still burns.  The best course is to just disengage from society until this whole thing collapses in in itself, and to try to rebuild something sane of the Left from the ashes, but for now trying to speak out in anything but GC or RW spaces is going to be futile and socially suicidal.  We are in this for the long haul.  Im not saying to team up with politics you hate, Im saying Im stepping back and watching society burn from a distance."

Apparently you are pretty bad at assuming others mentality. Maybe you should, ya know, not do that. Try getting to know a Transgender person. Get a first hand view of THEIR perspective instead of spouting hate and assuming you know what they feel."
79,,gendercritfem,"""progressive"" causes lose ground all the time, even ones that are actually progressive.

In the past several decades, we've lost ground in union rights, abortion rights, voting rights for ethnic minorities, and immigration rights. The president is Donald J. Trump. ""Progressivism"" isn't some magic word that guarantees success.

And I think the rot can be excised, there's even historical precedent! This isn't the first time that a movement for oppression has latched onto a progressive cause. In the first wave of feminism, there were lots of anti-immigrant bigots who managed to shoehorn their agenda into the legitimate suffrage movement. In the 2000s, neocons tried to claim that the bloody invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan were ""feminist"" projects designed to liberate women. Both of these were accepted as ""progressive"" in their time, but are not viewed as such today. The trans movement is similar to these in that it claims to be an extension of a genuine progressive cause (LGB rights), while only using it as an excuse to oppress and endanger women. I have faith that people will eventually recognize the mistake that was made here, as they have in the past."

What I meant was that now given that this has become THE cause de jour of those with the power to dictate what ""Progress"" means, there is no going back.  They are in charge of the ""progressive movement"" now and I dont think they will ever allow trans shit to be taken off the table.  It would take a political coup of sorts, and would require new organizations - the trans will not be excised from the posts they were awarded.  Theyre willing to use Human Rights Courts to get their balls fondled, imagine what theyll do when threatened with political displacement.  We put a monkey in the drivers seat and we cant get it out now.  But forming ""new movements"" means a splintering of effort and loss of effectiveness.  I dont think there is a good answer to this problem.  I think the things that could be done to fix this would be unpalatable to everyone involved, and will never happen.  I don't think we'll ever see an alliance of ""right and left"" on this, which is what it would take to have the required political weight.  So we fracture.  Factions will form, each weaker than the previous.  I dont think this gets fixed short of dramatic change in planetary/societal conditions, ie a collapse of industrial civilization.  Until then, catgirls have the monopoly on ""our"" voices, be that women or progressives or minorities or pro-healthcare folks.  It doesn't look good.

Have you ever seen the TV show ""Dexter?""

Honestly, it's a fairly accurate representation of how psychopaths think. As Dexter goes about his life, he's always asking himself *""how would a normal person react in this situation?""* and Dexter is constantly attempting to mimic human emotion, when the truth is that he's just a blank automaton. Being a psychopath is very much like being a robot. Mark Zuckerberg is an obvious example, he's just a complete robot. *""The Social Network""* did a wonderful job of capturing that.

Now, understanding all of that, *what if you were a psychopath who was attempting to pass as a woman?* You would do all the things that you've seen women do. And that's what a lot of these TiMs are mimicking; they're acting out the things that they've seen their sisters do, or their mothers do. It's the reason they have this weird disconnect from human morality. No sane woman would throw a pool party with topless twelve year olds, but a male psychopath would."

159,,merewautt,"A lot of doctors will actually argue that it's *healthier* long term to skip periods with birth control. Every period the lining is shed and regrown and *any* biology mechanism that involves injury or growing new tissue ups the life long risk for cancer. Because every new cell formed in the body has the possibly of malfunctioning, going rogue and multiplying rapidly. Which is the definition of a cancerous cell.

Women in the past were pregnant much more often during their lifetime, and many doctors think the modern woman may be at higher risk for ovarian cancer due to hundreds of more periods during their reproductive years. So many of them *recommend* skipping periods if your birth control allows it.

Hormonal birth control has it own issues for a lot of women, but if you're already using it successfully without terrible side effects, don't listen to the scare tactics telling you to take the sugar week and get your period if you don't get any peace of mind out of it. *A lot* of researchers think it lowers your lifetime risk for ovarian cancer."

> This portion of my decision addresses Ms. Yaniv’s complaints against Blue Heaven Beauty Lounge and Ms. Benipal, Ms. DaSilva, Ms. Tran, Ms. Dulay, and Merle Norman. In each of these cases, the Respondents advertised the service of “brazilian waxing”, and it was this service which Ms. Yaniv attempted to book. These cases raise two common issues at the outset: (1) what service was Ms. Yaniv requesting, and (2) does this service constitute a brazilian wax, such that it is one the Respondents were customarily providing to the public.  In this section, I address each of these issues in turn, and then go on to apply my findings to each individual complaint.
>
>9 A.The service Ms. Yaniv was requesting Ms. Yaniv does not dispute that she was requesting that these Respondents wax her genitals. In this unique context, her genitals were therefore relevant to her complaints – specifically to the question of whether the Respondents customarily provided the type of genital waxing that she was requesting. Throughout the hearing, however, Ms. Yaniv refused to answer questions about her genitals and argued that such questions were inappropriate. Given her representation to various Respondents that she had “male parts”, has not “gone through surgery”, and “was born a man now I’m a woman”, the hearings initially proceeded on the understanding that she has a penis and scrotum, and that she was therefore requesting waxing of the scrotum. However, under cross examination she was evasive on the issue, referring to “whatever is down there”. In the Blue Heaven hearing on July 4, she insinuated that she may be intersex but refused to say whether she was. Asked to explain what she meant when she told Ms. Benipal she had “male parts”, she testified simply “I mean male parts”.  On July 17, in the hearing against Ms. DaSilva, Ms. Yaniv testified that she had “male genitals”. Moments later, she testified, for the first time, that she is intersex. She said again that she had “male parts” and then added that she had “other stuff”, though she initially refused to say whether that included a vulva. She denied, for the first time, that she had asked Ms. DaSilva to wax a scrotum. Ms. Yaniv refused to answer questions put to her by Ms. DaSilva’s counsel, and so I intervened:
>
>Tribunal:   Ms. Yaniv, it’s relevant to this complaint. ... The question is, what were you asking Ms. DaSilva to wax?
>
>Ms. Yaniv:  I was asking for a female genital waxing wax .... A brazilian wax.
>
>Tribunal:  ... Forget brazilian, brozilian, male, female, whatever – what body part were you asking her to ask?
>
>Ms. Yaniv:  The genitals, the genital region.
>
>Tribunal:  Their defence hinges on a defence that they, that she, is not comfortable waxing a scrotum. So are you talking about a scrotum, or are you talking about a vulva, or are you talking about both?
>
>Ms. Yaniv:  The second one.
>
>Tribunal:  Vulva?
>
>Ms. Yaniv:  Yes.
>
>Tribunal:  ... You’re saying you were asking her to wax a vulva? Ms. Yaniv:
>
> Yes. ... I’m not gonna say whether I have the whole thing. I’ll say it exists.
>
> At this point, Mr. Cameron asked Ms. Yaniv to submit to an independent medical examination to verify her genitals. I refused to make such an order, on the basis that it was unduly intrusive and disproportionate to the issues at stake.  I am satisfied, based on Ms. Yaniv’s representations to the Respondents that she has “male parts”, “used to be a boy”, and has not “gone through surgery yet”, as well as her evidence in these hearings that she has “male parts”, that Ms. Yaniv was seeking to have hair removed from a scrotum. Whether or not she may also have a vulva is not ultimately determinative of any issue in this complaint and so I do not need to engage further with that question"

> However, I find that Ms. Yaniv’s predominant motive in filing her waxing complaints is not to prevent or remedy alleged discrimination, but to target small businesses for personal financial gain. In many of these complaints, she is also **motivated to punish racialized and immigrant women based on her perception that certain ethnic groups, namely South Asian and Asian communities, are “taking over”** and advancing an agenda hostile to the interests of LGBTQ+ people.

|Totals|458|126|78.4%|118|471|20.0%|

* 78.4% of 584 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual acknowledged at least one lifetime incidence of autogynephilic arousal, compared to just 20% MtF subjects classified as homosexual.

* In four of the five studies (Lawrence excluded) reporting MtF subjects' history of transvestic fetishism, 73% of 382 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual reported at least one lifetime episode of transvestic fetishism, compared to just 20% MtF subjects classified as homosexual.

* In Lawrence's (2005) study of of 232 MtF transsexuals patients who underwent SRS, 90% of 202 MtF subjects classified as non-homosexual reported at least one lifetime episode of autogynephilic arousal, with median and modal frequencies of hundreds of episodes or more. Of the 12 MtF subjects classified as homosexual, only 3 (25%) reported at least on episode one lifetime episode of autogynephilic arousal, and ""the median and modal number of episodes homosexual participants reported were both never.""

* In Nuttbrock's et al. (2011) study, 40% of the exclusively homosexual MtF group began HRT during adolescence, compared to just 1% of the heterosexual MtF group and 14% of the bisexual MtF group. Thus validating Blanchard's observation that homosexual MtF transsexuals present for clinical assessment at a significantly younger age than non-homosexual MtF transsexuals. Furthermore, 82% of exclusively gynephilic MtF subjects reported a history of transvestic fetishism, compared to just 14% of MtF subjects who had started HRT during adolescence."

We love to insult ourselves.

Seriously, are you really that daft? Jesus Christ. And you people say we're the ones getting offended for no reason.

And about your first point, it's missing mine entirely, and not worth responding to; you went on this rant about how changing sex and gender aren't the same thing even though I never implied that they were. All I said is that the ""egg"" analogy applies to gender identity and not to sex change.

Also, you know it's not only birds who lay eggs right? Not that it matters cause either way it's just an analogy but the mental gymnastics you did to be offended by it impress me."
491,,livipup,"That analogy with birds is a bit of a stretch. And, well, sex is complicated. There are things scientifically recognized as primary sexual characteristics which can naturally change throughout a person's lifetime or are even expected to. It's also possible to be born with these primary sexual characteristics mismatched. There's even research suggesting that trans people are neurologically intersex.

Unless maybe there are just as many or more saying something different.

500,,TrueJacksonVP,"These women are likely bi or pan if they are attracted to pre-op penis in any way, shape, or form.

This is the problem we as lesbians are currently facing. Lesbians cannot find a penis attractive, that’s *why* we’re lesbians. Otherwise we’d likely be open to dating men or pre-op transwomen. We’d also be *bisexual* for it.

The girls claiming “I’m a lesbian and *I* like girl dick, so all you other lesbians are being close minded and transphobic” are a huge part of the problem right now. I as a lesbian *cannot* force myself to like penises and their functions. They psychically turn me off. I don’t even enjoy penetration. Yet I’ve been told that I’m transphobic and close minded for not being open to girl penis. If a straight male said this to me, it’d be considered homophobic. No one would *ever* demand a gay man accept their vagina. Genitalia is an important part of sexuality and for some is *the* most important part. Transbians have no right to demand penis acceptance from an established group of women who hate penis. Most of the transbians I’ve encountered have no desire for bottom surgery and still like their penis. But they rarely fuck each other — which really tells you all you need to know.

Right now a lot of bisexuals and straight women are appropriating lesbian culture and identity because it’s somehow “cooler” or “easier” to just cut and dry state they’re a lesbian than explain the intricacies of their own sexuality. I understand why they might, but this in turn damages “actual” lesbians who are not afforded the same leniencies in terms of our rigid sexualities. If you’re a lesbian who likes penis, you’re not a lesbian haha. And people get really angry when you gatekeep their identity (even though they do not fit the “requirements” for the identity they’ve chosen). They then damage the perception of lesbians because of attitudes like “well she *was* a lesbian and now she’s dating Rob, so I guess they all secretly want the D”. We don’t.


Sorry for the novel and that’s not at all directly at you, it’s just extremely frustrating to be a cis lesbian in this day and age. It was easier a decade ago — which is mind blowing. As gay men and trans folk progress, lesbian identity had become watered down and appropriated by men with fetishes, entitled/upset transwomen, and bisexuals who don’t realize the damage they’re doing by claiming to be a lesbian while harboring attraction towards dick."
501,,corny_reptile,">Save

You are moving the goal posts. The claim was that primary sex characteristics naturally change and trans people are ""neurologically intersex."" I don't think the WHO and APA are saying anything of the sort. Sure a penis or a vulva will change with puberty but they don't naturally change from one to the other! That's absurd."

592,,WitchMeansWoman,If you really thought it was normal you would have just asked your sister for her underwear rather than steal it. You know you are violating her. That’s why you like it. That’s why no one feels bad for you.

This shit is not normal, not valid, not acceptable, and certainly not something a woman would do or explain. Pathetic little boy."
596,,SureSureFightFight,"NORMAL DOES NOT MEAN GOOD.

I'm so fucking sick of ""Everyone does it, so it's normal and healthy!""

Nobody says murder is healthy, and yet it's a 'normal' part of human society. Nobody says theft is healthy, and yet it's perfectly normal to want to take things that don't belong to you (as in, everyone's thought it, not ""everyone is a kleptomaniac"").

For most of human history, rape was normal and yet everyone agrees that rape is fucking horrible.


And you know what? The guy isn't even right. Out of seven billion people you can find a lot of people with incestuous feelings, but statistically it is **rare**. It is **not normal**. Anyone who has taken a college sociology class can tell you that there are so many psychological safeguards in place to prevent that.


And hey, I know you're probably reading this and have all sorts of prepared arguments to regurgitate, so let me just tell you:

**I don't care.** Your bullshit is so obvious a mile off, and anyone not tainted by your delusion can see it.


And lastly,

>Akin to bullying, but I'm used to it

It's not bullying, it's holding you up as an example to make sure nobody else becomes a creepy pervert. Just like all the other 'bullies' have been doing with you.

Everyone goes through stuff. Most people don't jack off in another person's underwear. If you are so afraid of 'feeling ashamed', maybe there is a good reason for that."

Protip: If you're 20 years old, and you want a girlfriend, the easiest way to get one is *to ask a girl out.* You can lift weights until you're blue in the face, but if you don't actually ask a girl out, you're wasting your time.

She NEVER asked him what his penis is until when she was about 4 ish and saw her little cousin naked and saw he had one too, obviously, being a sane person we simply told her that boys have a penis.  As she got older we got her a book about bodies that explains anatomy and sex and periods in child friendly terms (she hides it under her bed but approaches me occasionally to ask for clarification).

This man should tell his child the truth. He’s a male and so he has a penis. If his dysphoria isn’t bad enough that he’s able to keep and use his penis to impregnate his wife surely he can tell his child what a penis is and what it’s used for?

One such problem is the fact that you dont have to be trans to be mentally unstable and have kids. Plenty of GC people are too mentally unstable to raise children, but they have children anyway. Should we take away the children from these people as well? If so, then it's not really a debate on trans people, but mentally unstable people in general. But then that leads to the problem of ""assuming"" that trans people are mentally unstable, which is not a hot topic for discussion in the PC world we live in. Because of this, people just wont hear it. They'll turn their ears off to it or scream and yell until the topic is removed from discussion.

But even if we were able to get this discussion into the public forum, they would want proof that a child raised in a trans household is at risk of becoming mentally ill. This leads to even more problems, because even if that child ends up becoming trans, the trans community will just say ""THEY WERE BORN THAT WAY ITS NOT THE PARENTS FAULT"" or if they do become mentally ill then it's because ""SOCIETY BULLIED THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR TRANS PARENTS"". They will find a way to draw the narrative to represent their own agenda, and the faceless masses will agree with them so they dont appear to be oppressive shitlords.

Honestly, it's just not worth the fuss. It's for the best that we quietly seethe to ourselves and circlejerk our distaste for the mental illness known as transgenderism amongst ourselves."

Men are dogs. Gay men are dogs with no leash. And  I include trans people in this. Trans 'women' mostly seem to go with other trans 'women' which basically means its two gay men.

2. Men do have breasts (and can get breast cancer) and there are even men who are fit who have A cup breasts if they have the right proportions. It's just uncommen.

My interest in participating in these subs is to show other women the TiM in the stall next to you likely isn't the 'totally just another woman' she's been promised so hopefully she'll wise up and join the movement or at least keep her wits about her same as she would around any other man. Or, to show any lurking TiMs there might be another explanation for their 'dysphoria', AGP/porn addiction, while all the gender clinics and TRAs shove them on the express train towards transitioning so maybe they reevaluate before doing something irreversible.

If anything I really just want people to have more information to make them safer, on both sides of the fence. I would never wish harm or violence on anyone no matter how much I disagree with them and I wouldn't participate in a sub that didn't make it an explicit rule."

They just get banned periodically and then a new one pops up to repeat the cycle

I think we have to admit that the project of this sub fundamentally goes against Reddit's core beliefs, and they will be looking for any reason to ban us. While I agree we shouldn't hand them that reason, we shouldn't be too zealous in our moderation either, as people here express frustration or disgust they are not able to express irl.

Trans ideology labels our belief that they are not women as violence in itself anyway, no matter how much we sugar coat it. When Reddit admins inevitably accept that premise, we'll be banned, so why take extra measures to prevent it?"
