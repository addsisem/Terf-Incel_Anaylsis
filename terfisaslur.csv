0,AutoModerator,"Welcome to r/terfisaslur. 

What is a ""TERF""? While ""TERF"" is supposed to stand for ""Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist,"" the people called ""TERF"" generally are neither radical feminists nor ""trans exclusionary,"" and in practice the term has become a slur. [More info.](https://redd.it/70cyzm)

We're documenting hateful rhetoric directed at lesbians, radical feminists, gender critical feminists, and others on Reddit and beyond.

If you're curious about why certain trans activists are clashing with some feminists, see [these resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/wiki/resources#wiki_great_resources_for_people_new_to_gender_critical_feminism) from r/GenderCritical.

1,GenderIsntCritical,"They can change their hair or what they wear, but no matter what they do, a man is still a man"
2,WikiMB,That explains how much violent the response for any skepticism regarding transgenderism is. And because of it I either hide or use my alt account to rise my voice on topics like these.
3,Killy00013,Am I misreading this? It sounds like she doesn't belive both sides behave badly calling it a fallacy and also seems to support jk rowling by saying that those who send her death and rape threats arent women
4,maat89,And I opp....
5,Tulcey-Lee,"I had an account locked yesterday on twitter. Unable to have a discussion with said person as they resorted to calling me a bitch and a terf and then the rape threats started. How is it now we live in a world where you can‚Äôt disagree anymore? Your opinion means you are fine to be harassed and threatened. 
I stated biology and that women don‚Äôt have a penis and there was no coherent argument just abuse."
6,Cha-Challenger,"They can change their name or what they call themselves, but no matter what they do, a terf is still a terf. (Ironic huh)"
7,qsims,She doesn‚Äôt she‚Äôs pointing out how bullshit the claim is
8,Cha-Challenger,What did you do to cause this? Can you link the thread?
9,Killy00013,"she forgot to put /s then, I hate when people are sarcastic online, I usually cant tell because nowdays you can say the most fcked up things and actually mean them"
10,Tulcey-Lee,"They said some
Women have penis‚Äôs and I said no they don‚Äôt."
11,qsims,But she‚Äôs not being sarcastic..?
12,Killy00013,"if she isnt sarcastic then she sounds like she is on jk's side, that's how i see it"
13,qsims,I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt understand how?
14,2or3thingsIknow,They simply do not care. Because of all the social capital they have they are literally acting like terrorists and slamming women all over the place.
15,baconbitsy,"Honey, the amount of people who use ‚ÄúTERF‚Äù to stop a discussion is ridiculous.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna debate you because you‚Äôre a TERF!‚Äù followed by a lot of nonsensical insults just proves what they really are: misogynists."
16,Vibrosphere,You're invalidating the women who menstruate by sticking tomato juice Popsicles in their recta and collecting the meltjuice with tampons and menstrual pads.
17,Simone_Auclert,If you're woman who acknowledges reality you're a terf.
18,,[removed]
19,Cha-Challenger,First off all they're not saying MtFs can have periods. They're saying FtMs can still have periods post transition.
20,mypretties,"They have a ton of time of their hands since 99% of society wants nothing to do with them.

TIMs: ‚ÄúI can be a normal man and go out and achieve a good life for myself or I can sit in my mom‚Äôs basement, shriek TERF at her if she questions me stealing my sister‚Äôs panties, eat cheetos, stick tomato juice up my ass and mod r/actuallesbians. Hmmm gonna have to go with choice #2!‚Äù"
21,stargazer612,Oh dear gawd is this a thing????
22,TheCatsEyeNebula,A few months and they'll use this as an arguement.
23,BellejarredDylan,But testosterone stops periods. So Ftm shouldn't be having them
24,Vibrosphere,"You know I want to go shake my finger at the youth and yell at them to GTFO my lawn but a lot of the most egregious TIMs are men older than myself (41)

Like, bro, you should know better."
25,Vibrosphere,Well documented.
26,Idkjustgotquestions,Depends for some it takes a while for it to take effect and some aren‚Äôt on hormone replacement yet.
27,insomniac29,I know an FTM that sometimes gets periods for missing hormone doses. A lot of trans people don‚Äôt have regular access to treatment. They‚Äôre saving up for a hysterectomy. Or technically someone who hasn‚Äôt started treatment yet or for some reason doesn‚Äôt want medical treatment could identify as trans.
28,stargazer612,Just researched and will now scrub my browser history. Omg
29,BellejarredDylan,Im still going to only say women have periods
30,insomniac29,"Okay that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm just responding to your post saying that an FTM can‚Äôt have a period, they sometimes do."
31,girl_undone,Locked because this is still getting brigaded a month later.

51,sarahkate2011,Karma whoring at its finest.
52,QueenRowana,"What we want if for men to stay out of womens spaces. Simple. Fighting for women is a good thing. If that means some men get their little girl panties (that they love wearing so much) in a twist. I ain‚Äôt upset. And if they want to use slurs and threaten us while doing it. Well thats hurtful but still inconsequential. Because that report button isn‚Äôt just decorative.  I‚Äôm standing up for women so men, yeah i dont care if you chop off your dick or wear a dress and makeup.  They‚Äôre never gonna be a woman. 
Have a lovely day!"
53,QueenRowana,"I love that this is still pissing men off almost a month later. Men who, by the way, are not and never will be women. Sorry you have no life. Big F (whatever that means)"
54,QueenRowana,I don‚Äôt think i understand what you mean?
55,QueenRowana,"Right so how much of that post did you read and how long have the Tims been whispering in your ear? 

Women‚Äôs spaces should be for women and women only. These weirdos in wigs and dresses are not and can never be women. No matter how badly they mutilate their genitals. I will not bow down to their behavior and i will not accept insults from ‚Äúallies‚Äù like you.  You contribute to a system that demeans women and denies us our existence. A system that doesn‚Äôt even allow lesbian her sexuality anymore. A system where a male mediocre weightlifter can decide today that he is a woman and start winning gold medals in women‚Äôs classifications tomorrow. 

Terf is a foul slur usually accompanied by threats of beatings, rapes and murder to women who refuse to cater to men‚Äôs fragile ego‚Äôs and most notably their autogynephila and fetishes. 
I refuse to be called names by woke weirdos like you who think women should die when all we want is to make men get out of our faces, out of our sports and out of out bathrooms. We dont want them to die, we want them to act like a normal human being. Not a anime doll. But you just echo what they teach you. 

Next time you call someone trash please re-read this message and realize i could have just insulted you right back. But i didnt do that. Now try and see who is the one between us two capable of calm and rational thought and who has used cursewords as their only retort to a woman standing up for herself."
56,QueenRowana,"They‚Äôre men. The text says nothing about qualification. I wouldnt want to be treated by an unqualfied woman either. But i dint want to be cared for by a man perion.  These are men, not ‚Äútrans women!?!!‚Äù And yes they are attempting to steal women only spaces. They are men. It‚Äôs their ultimate goal it seems."
57,QueenRowana,Correct i didn‚Äôt write it. But i had not seen it on this sub before and loved it. I agree with it completely. Men can get the hell out if womens spaces. They are not welcome. And diaper fetishists too by the way sir!
58,auklet,"Terf is used as a slur, by trans rights activists. You'll often hear it in phrases such as ""kill all terfs.""  I think many ""terfs"" agree that ""terf""  is an accurate term when used to mean ""woman who doesn't agree that a man can become a woman."" But trans activists use it to mean, ""Person who refuses to validate my claim to be a woman and therefore should be humiliated, ostracized, and murdered. """

64,kaladinner,"Gotcha, thanks. Are the majority of you also sex-worker exclusionary as well? If you remove delusions of infinite genders, and hedonistic pornographer women being glorified, then I can get behind feminism. I mean, I'm still gonna call obese, dyed haired women ""SJWs""; and I'm sure as hell not denying that men are biologically stronger than women, but other non-sexually-immoral ideologies you guys hold are fine by me."
65,QueenRowana,"I‚Äôm not against normal men who mind their own business at all. Men can be great. I‚Äôm only against trans people if they are men trying to get away with stuff and get into female spaces by wearing dresses and turning their penis inside out or even just claiming they are women while they arent even remotely trying, they are literally just men. I have little to no trouble with women who try to become men. They don‚Äôt bother me usually. I say good luck to them. They are still weird but I wish them luck fitting in with men. But men trying to be women. Yeah i have something against them and i will fight against them and for women.  

Every day. 

Again. Have a nice day."
66,QueenRowana,"I didnt write it. I do agree with it though. 

I never said YOU were a man. I just said ‚Äòmen‚Äô but if you felt like i was talking about you go off i guess. 

And are you sure you‚Äôre a woman. Isn‚Äôt that enforcing a gender binary which could hurt trans peoples feelings? (Big sarcasm in case you didn‚Äôt get that)"
67,QueenRowana,"I am indeed not bothered at all by that. Because i care about women and preserving our spaces, not about the fragile ego‚Äôs of men who like to wear dresses and want to be called ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù"
68,QueenRowana,That dont mean it‚Äôs untrue though. Men with a trans fetish are a danger to women. Whether i wrote it or not doesnt make it false.
69,auklet,"Radical feminists,  ftom what I read, see ""sex work"" including porn as exploitative."
70,girl_undone,"It's a misnomer to say feminists are ""excluding"" ""sex workers"" when we say that the men who rape and sell women in sexual slavery and prostitution are horrible and shouldn't be able to do that."

> . Men don‚Äôt try to get into female spaces by being trans. 

Lol. It‚Äôs 50% ‚Äúgrr i‚Äôm not allowed in womens [fill in here: bathroom, locker room, rape shelter, prison] Let‚Äôs put on a dress and waltz in, no one will dare stop me‚Äù. These are predators out to get weak women and many cases are documented of  so called ‚Äútrans women‚Äù (men) getting permission to go to female prision instead of male and at the very least creeping the fuck out of vulnerable women and at worst rape and hurt them. Many cases about men freaking out for not being admitted to women rape shelters. Cases of men sendingvdeath threats to lesbians who refuse to fuck men with dicks. Of pedophiles who claim to be trans to get lowered sentences. Of men going Into womens bathrooms with ugly dresses and terrible fake wigs just for fun and to terrify women in a space where once they would have come to get away from men. 

And 50% ‚Äú i just want to have tits to play with and be submissive slut in bed‚Äù. Of which the last one i will admit are usually not quite as nefarious. But they‚Äôre definitely AGP."
75,QueenRowana,"Fetish? Lol i have literally 0 fetishes.  Your ‚Äútendencies‚Äù are a fetish. 
I care about women enough to not want men with dicks forcing themselves into lesbian spaces, into women rape shelters, into womens locker rooms, toilets and prisons.  If your main objective is forcing women to just lie down and take it while men like you walk all over them you are not a feminist."

77,QueenRowana,"Fascination with ‚Äúlady dick‚Äù? I have never used that word except to express my disgust at the word. Maybe you mistook my disgusted frustration at men referring to penises as a ‚Äúgirldick‚Äù for fascination, HalfBreed?

Men like you saying stuff like ‚Äòkill terfs‚Äô are inciting violence against women yet somehow i‚Äôm the one who doesnt care about women? Thats cute dude! Such a male thing to do!

81,SearchLightsInc,‚ÄúSorry to hear you felt assaulted but we all know women don‚Äôt really feel fear for rational reasons and it was probably an overreaction on your part sweetheart x ‚Äú /s
82,pennysapphic,"Oh I'm so sorry to hear about your experience and ptsd... but you'll still find a way to swallow it down for the comfort of men, right? 

Oh I'm so sorry that you were raped, but you still understand that *not all men* do that, right? You musnt forget to say that before and after you apologetically share what happened to you. 

Oh I'm sorry the rape crisis center was defunded by a man, but I hope you understand it's because those women were bigots for wanting to heal privately and with dignity. Their wants outweigh your needs, because as a woman, you are everything they wish they were. This is ""privledge"", not objectification. 

Oh I'm so so sorry to hear you didnt place in your sport after training your whole life because men now compete in womens sports. But the fact they get the limited scholarships and opportunities for women, should really be an inspiration for you to just work harder and be quietly supportive.

Oh I'm so so VERY sorry that abortions are punishable by a life sentence in certain states and getting harder and harder to access, but it seems so exclusionary since transwomen dont get to experience this, so we shouldn't focus on it. The most important thing is that everything is about transwomen all the time. If it's not, then it's about how it hurts them that it's not, and THAT is the important peice of every puzzle. 

Oh, you dont like the red robes they are rolling out...I'm so so so sorry about that. But it's because you are lucky enough to be born a woman. I wish I was a woman, red is definitely my color and the cap hides my male pattern baldness UwU"

Why? Because they know it‚Äôs bullshit. They know trans women aren‚Äôt really women."

So it just a waiting game for now.
263,Lady_Montgomery,"When you think you are the opposite sex you are most definitely mentally ill. Its like saying you are born in the wrong body and that you are an alien from galaxy 1000 miles away. It's not real. It's a mask for something else. A personality disorder, childhood trauma, even trauma in later life, autism, internalized homophobia, internalized misogyny, plain old misogyny (when it comes to men claiming to be women) etc. It's a symptom. Not an actual thing. But it's also a multi billion business that preys on the unstable. As long as there are people that can make a shit load of money on the mentally disturbed they will. Providing actual help doesn't make people as much money. And as long as people sign a contract that says informed consent, they can actually get away with it. It's vile and grotesque.

Every single person that claims to be of the opposite gender is at least highly mentally unstable and often times mentally ill."

272,Eowyn19,Exactly what I was thinking. It‚Äôs already happened. Hardly any libfems even know about trans criminals because discussing them is ‚Äúliterally violence‚Äù.
273,0WatcherintheWater0,"You seem to not understand modern gender theory. What makes someone a certain gender is a combination of three things. 1) identity (what gender you see yourself as), 2) body (what physical characteristics society prescribes to different genders), and 3) presentation (what behaviors are prescribed to certain genders, an example would be gender roles). You‚Äôll notice that chromosomes have nothing to do with it. So long as Trans people fit two out of those three things, they **are** the opposite gender, your opinion on the subject is irrelevant.  They aren‚Äôt mentally ill. Gender dysphoria still is a mental illness, of course, but for separate reasons, and a lot of trans people aren‚Äôt dysphoric.

Also, it‚Äôs not a mask, sure there are trans people who change in order to cover up past trauma, but the vast majority are sincere in their beliefs. 

May I ask, what do you think would actually help trans people beyond surgery? Therapy wouldn‚Äôt do anything beyond maybe making them more suicidal, that‚Äôs for sure."

>""If You See Something, Say Something¬Æ"" is a national campaign that raises public awareness of the indicators of terrorism and terrorism-related crime, as well as the importance of reporting suspicious activity to state and local law enforcement.  

I'll be reporting to both. This is above Reddits paygrade, nor do I trust them to actually do anything about it."
275,2or3thingsIknow,"Yep, he's a real psycho that one."
276,Lady_Montgomery,"I heard all that bs before and it's a cry for attention. There males and females. Gender roles are bs. Chromosomes determine your sex, which equals your gender. The end. Basic biology. So called trans people need psychological help to determine what is truly the matter with them: a personality disorder, autism, trauma (sexual or other wise), internalized homophobia/misogyny. The only reason it isn't qualified as a mental disorder officially is because it has become a multi billion industry. The profits made to mutilate so called transgenders are so incredibly high. So of course they want the medical world to say its okay and normal. Trans people do not exist. It's as simple as that. A d you know it too else you wouldn't be commenting here. You are looking for validation from people who are telling you the truth. If you can convince us, you can convince yourself. I wish you the best. And I hope you find proper help to help you with either you personality disorder or your past trauma you haven't dealt with yet. Good luck.

BTW if you aren't dysphoric, no need to mutilate your body either and pump it full with hormones your body isnt meant to produce. You know doing that when you aren't dysphoric doesn't make sense."

288,meow_thug,I was so brainwashed by TRAs up until a few months ago that this wasn't even my peak moment. Truly unbelievable. And lib fems don't have a fucking thing to say when I use this example of why exclusivity is paramount for women's spaces.
289,bishhpls,"If something sums up these people's utter hatred and contempt for women, this is it. The fact they are demanding women who have been traumatised by men and their male bodies allow them into the one space that is meant to be totally free of those traumatic elements, simply to validate their 'true and honest womanhood' is nothing short of horrifying. If a literal rape crisis centre isn't safe, where is?

They want to allow men who have a sexual fetish regarding objectifying women into a slew of outdated sexist stereotypes into a place where women are healing from sexual trauma. Where they will most likely exude exhibitionism and sexually harass these vulnerable women. All for sexual gratification and their own validation. TIMs claim to need these centres, and some may, but I believe the number of them that truly need shelter may be quite low and the rest are just creepy boundary pushing AGPs. Yet when they are offered separate accommodations away from the women, that just isn't good enough, they must be treated as exactly the same as a biological woman, even though they are NOT the same and belong to the group who victimised the women in the first place. That tells you all you need to know. They do not care about the actual shelter, they just care they're not included and not being constantly validated. So selfish."

However, you can't just opt-out of reality. I can say I‚Äôm a walrus --but if I show up on a beach none of the other walruses are going to be particularly impressed me and zero percent of them will buy it. As for the rest of what I wrote, the concept remains the same so I don't see a point in editing it. 

( Correction: in order to not feed into delusional thinking I did indeed edit pronouns in my previous comment in order to reflect reality.) 

You understood it clearly enough. You don't have to be a girly girl, you can have short hair, you can have your breasts removed--you can take hormones if you want because its your body and you can do what you want with it --but how you express your personal aesthetics has exactly zero impact on biological fact.  You're still a woman and the rest of the world has no obligation to play along with your fantasy. You need to accept who you actually are, a non conformist  woman, instead of making up a whole new person to distance yourself from the things you dislike about the world and your body."

427,,"tbh i've finally had this coalesce in my mind and i've been trying to bring it up at every opportunity. the \*mere engagement in trans identification\* is abusive because it is \*gaslighting\*. I have not seen \*one\* man in a dress who doesn't engage in the abusive factors of 1) denying reality (with the expectation that those he demands deny it as well) and 2) threatening violence (on himself or others) when or even just at the possibility that people don't comply with his demands of reality denial. (Threats to 't\*rfs' or 'transphobes' and threats to himself through threatening suicide or implying that not denying reality will force others to kill themselves.) 

&#x200B;

i now believe (and have seen no evidence otherwise) that these men who ""identify as women"" are unilaterally abusers, because at the bare minimum their gaslighting is abusive. with abuse comes predatory behavior, and thank you for saying this because i had not thought about that aspect of it too. the more time i spend here and on sister subs and read news articles (like the [recent win by a young man with pink hair to have unrestricted access to all the masturbatory aid he needed in the form of real live uncensored vulnerable teenage women](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/11/14/palatine-schaumburg-high-school-district-votes-to-give-transgeder-students-unrestricted-locker-room-access/)) the more i am convinced that every single one is a narcissistic abusive predator."

It‚Äôs funny when the opposite happens ‚Äî rad fems reblogging TRA or QT content. The notes on those posts are just hilarious.

445,moonflower,You lost me - I don't know who you are criticising - the OP here or the commenter in the linked page ...?

447,LesbianPrincess-,"It‚Äôd be cool if a GC feminist/radfem made these shirts and used the profits to help women, like donating to Vancouver Rape Relief or something. :)"
448,LesbianPrincess-,"You‚Äôre so sweet!!! You‚Äôre more awesome :) <3 

I was in radfem tumblr, and below these comments there were radfems/women calling him out. But I could only fit so much into a screenshot. 

Radfem tumblr is the best tumblr! So much wisdom there. & REALLY cool, smart, brilliant, hilarious women. It feels like a true sisterhood. Pretty inspiring actually. <3

(And yes, I‚Äôm happy to recommend some subs if you want!)"
449,EgregiousWeasel,"I'm so glad to hear that. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders. I wish you all the best, and I hope you ace your exams! <3"
450,LesbianPrincess-,"Wait, seriously? It‚Äôs a dude? Wow. 

Explains the fragile ego, the need to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù women, the incessant arguing, refusal to admit that he‚Äôs wrong and doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about, etc."
451,olatundew,"At best, this makes the accusation of TERF foolish and strategically misguided. We don't know if there was prior context, but we *do* know that they chose to spin off the wording used in the previous comment."
452,LesbianPrincess-,Nah. Lol
453,,The commenter in the linked page. It was a post about girls being taken advantage of. You‚Äôd have to be a special kind of asshole to derail that to point out a ‚Äúterf‚Äù
454,LesbianPrincess-,You commented on my post. üòπüòπ Thank you! That‚Äôs a compliment.
455,2or3thingsIknow,Looks that way. Posts on GenderCriticalGuys (gets almost no upvotes).
456,moonflower,"Yes, but that's another issue. Are you disagreeing with anything I said?"
457,moonflower,"You said: ""Mentioning anything about patriarchy, exploitation and trauma are ‚Äòterfy‚Äô now"" ... how is that *not* implying that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc?

You're denying what's right in front of you and laughing about it."
458,moonflower,"Oh yes, of course it was inappropriate, but the point I was making was that the accusation of 'terf' probably wasn't based on those comments - and we already know that people who use 'terf' as a derogatory term wouldn't be interested in discussing anything about how to protect female people, so they probably didn't even think about the current discussion, only concerned about silencing 'terfs'"
459,,[removed]
460,LesbianPrincess-,"Gee, I wonder why! What a loser lol. He should be banned from this subreddit. I reported the rude comments but maybe mods haven‚Äôt gotten to them yet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
461,olatundew,"Well, if we're splitting hairs, I disagree that it's ""very likely"" that this was in response to a previous comment.

More to the point, I do think that this part of the same issue - how do we have constructive conversations about complicated gender issues?"
462,LesbianPrincess-,"What exactly am I denying? I‚Äôm just disagreeing with you. 

Honestly, you‚Äôve been very rude to me in the past and I would like to be done with this convo. I actually know how tumblr works and this stuff is all too common. Plus there are too many users on there for there to be people who remember users‚Äô ‚Äúprior terfy conversations‚Äù or whatever. Men call us terfs for being feminists. Period. 

Bye.

Edit: Apparently the person I'm talking to is a MALE! What a surprise. Dominating the conversation and telling women that we don't know what we're talking about. He should be banned. Mansplaining at its finest, and he has the audacity to call himself a feminist. Wow."
463,,"Exactly, so that person is a trash gremlin regardless of what they were referencing. So it doesn't really matter."
464,LesbianPrincess-,"üòπüòπüòπ We get it, you‚Äôre insecure and projecting because of your small penis. Bye."
465,moonflower,"Do you really think it is at all likely that this person called them 'terfs' based solely on those comments, with no previous history between them?"
466,moonflower,"You are denying that your title implies that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc.

Also, how ironic that you complain of people who judge current comments based on prior conversations, at the same time as you are doing that exact same thing to me - you are the one who is being rude here, and rude in the past - way ruder than I have ever been to you.

I disagree with things that you say, and call you out on your bad behaviour, and you interpret that as ''rudeness'' and use it as an excuse to be even more rude to me."
467,moonflower,I think it does matter if OP is misrepresenting the situation
468,2or3thingsIknow,"Yes, because that is what these clownfish do. They label anything and everything terf because they cannot answer. Stop pretending you haven't seen this."
469,olatundew,"That's a slightly different claim from the original one, but yes - I've seen TERF used in some pretty atrocious ways (e.g. ""I'm going to rape you, you fucking TERF"") so I wouldn't rule it out. Plus, this particular comment they were responding to was purposeful and well-written, and seemed to be the beginning of a new conversation - so it seems a non-sequiter for it to have been part of an ongoing (quite bitter) dialogue."
470,LesbianPrincess-,"I‚Äôm not denying it. My ‚ÄúNah. Lol‚Äù was just dismissing what you were saying. 

I‚Äôm just saying I don‚Äôt have time to argue with you when you‚Äôve been rude in the past. Move along. Blocking you because I don‚Äôt have time for this weird drama. Lol. And not sure what ‚Äúbad behavior‚Äù you‚Äôre referencing. Pretty weird."
471,,There's no actual evidence that the situation is being misrepresented though???
472,moonflower,Actually I have never seen anyone called a 'terf' unless they have said something which suggests that they believe that male people cannot become female
473,moonflower,I don't really understand your reasoning at all - I came to the opposite conclusion based on exactly the same perception that it was a new conversation and *therefore* inappropriate to be calling anyone 'terfs' in response to the subject matter - much more likely that the person calling them 'terfs' was referring to a different conversation
474,moonflower,"OK, we'll see if you really do block me - perhaps that means I will be free to speak my views in future without you being rude and denying reality all over my comments eh"
475,moonflower,"Not on the linked page, no, but I think it's very likely that the accusation of 'terf' was in reference to a previous encounter and not based on the shown comments"
476,2or3thingsIknow,Male people are male people. Not female. Males. Stop fucking colonizing us you sick bastards. I'm done playing nice with you creeps.
477,olatundew,"That's because we're talking about two different scenarios. I'm saying this doesn't look like an out-of-context snippet of conversation, you're saying it does look like there is a background context to their relationship. Both could be true, or neither."
478,,[deleted]
479,zombieeezzz,Holy shit. Shut up. You keep repeating this point and no one cares.
480,,You think it‚Äôs very likely. Which means you have no actual evidence and all of the drama you‚Äôre causing about this is based on nothing but a hunch that nobody even cares about.

493,redlilitu,What's not surprising is that TRAs can't even empathize with the trauma a lot of women go through related to sexual assault and would use even that to attack us.

531,winewatcher,"I‚Äôve been permanently banned from several subs and I‚Äôve only been here for a couple of months. The other day I posted a commented empathizing with a woman female or trans I don‚Äôt know) who said she had been sexually assaulted and wanted to know if others thought she should report the friend who attacked her. Others said to report her rapist. I was empathic and also said that if she didn‚Äôt report him he would go on to rape other women. I finished with something like ‚ÄúThink of your sisters‚Äù. 

Some trans person must have looked at my profile or recognized my Reddit name and screamed at me online about having no right to comment, I was a pretend feminist, etc. 

Unfuckingbelievable!  Nothing I said was particularly feminist. It was just one woman empathasizing with the suffering of another woman at the hands of a man who attacked her. One human being reaching out to comfort another. 

The person who reacted so badly to not being centered in that moment was a man larping as a woman and doing it badly because he failed Female Bonding 101. 

He‚Äôs a man because his rage at me was so disproportionate to my comment and to the tone of the comment (empathy and sisterly advice which the woman asked for). 

He‚Äôs a man because he immediately jumped to who owns feminism when that wasn‚Äôt the topic. 

He‚Äôs a man because if it isn‚Äôt about him he can‚Äôt be quiet or move along. 

He‚Äôs a man because maybe the topic of sexual assault, rape, and friends who are attackers hit to close to home so he had to derail the thread."
