0,2or3thingsIknow,They simply do not care. Because of all the social capital they have they are literally acting like terrorists and slamming women all over the place.
1,baconbitsy,"Honey, the amount of people who use “TERF” to stop a discussion is ridiculous.  “I’m not gonna debate you because you’re a TERF!” followed by a lot of nonsensical insults just proves what they really are: misogynists."
2,Vibrosphere,You're invalidating the women who menstruate by sticking tomato juice Popsicles in their recta and collecting the meltjuice with tampons and menstrual pads.
3,Simone_Auclert,If you're woman who acknowledges reality you're a terf.
4,,[removed]
5,Cha-Challenger,First off all they're not saying MtFs can have periods. They're saying FtMs can still have periods post transition.
6,mypretties,"They have a ton of time of their hands since 99% of society wants nothing to do with them.

TIMs: “I can be a normal man and go out and achieve a good life for myself or I can sit in my mom’s basement, shriek TERF at her if she questions me stealing my sister’s panties, eat cheetos, stick tomato juice up my ass and mod r/actuallesbians. Hmmm gonna have to go with choice #2!”"
7,stargazer612,Oh dear gawd is this a thing????
8,TheCatsEyeNebula,A few months and they'll use this as an arguement.
9,BellejarredDylan,But testosterone stops periods. So Ftm shouldn't be having them
10,Vibrosphere,"You know I want to go shake my finger at the youth and yell at them to GTFO my lawn but a lot of the most egregious TIMs are men older than myself (41)

Like, bro, you should know better."
11,ESyzygy,I’m ok with r/actuallesbians but only because I only pay attention to the cutesy romantic posts and not the trans/“girldick” ones
12,Vibrosphere,Well documented.
13,Idkjustgotquestions,Depends for some it takes a while for it to take effect and some aren’t on hormone replacement yet.
14,insomniac29,I know an FTM that sometimes gets periods for missing hormone doses. A lot of trans people don’t have regular access to treatment. They’re saving up for a hysterectomy. Or technically someone who hasn’t started treatment yet or for some reason doesn’t want medical treatment could identify as trans.
15,stargazer612,Just researched and will now scrub my browser history. Omg
16,BellejarredDylan,Im still going to only say women have periods
17,insomniac29,"Okay that’s fine, I’m just responding to your post saying that an FTM can’t have a period, they sometimes do."

21,Tulcey-Lee,"I had an account locked yesterday on twitter. Unable to have a discussion with said person as they resorted to calling me a bitch and a terf and then the rape threats started. How is it now we live in a world where you can’t disagree anymore? Your opinion means you are fine to be harassed and threatened. 
I stated biology and that women don’t have a penis and there was no coherent argument just abuse."

94,QueenRowana,"What we want if for men to stay out of womens spaces. Simple. Fighting for women is a good thing. If that means some men get their little girl panties (that they love wearing so much) in a twist. I ain’t upset. And if they want to use slurs and threaten us while doing it. Well thats hurtful but still inconsequential. Because that report button isn’t just decorative.  I’m standing up for women so men, yeah i dont care if you chop off your dick or wear a dress and makeup.  They’re never gonna be a woman. 
Have a lovely day!"
95,QueenRowana,"I love that this is still pissing men off almost a month later. Men who, by the way, are not and never will be women. Sorry you have no life. Big F (whatever that means)"
96,QueenRowana,I don’t think i understand what you mean?
97,QueenRowana,"Right so how much of that post did you read and how long have the Tims been whispering in your ear? 

Women’s spaces should be for women and women only. These weirdos in wigs and dresses are not and can never be women. No matter how badly they mutilate their genitals. I will not bow down to their behavior and i will not accept insults from “allies” like you.  You contribute to a system that demeans women and denies us our existence. A system that doesn’t even allow lesbian her sexuality anymore. A system where a male mediocre weightlifter can decide today that he is a woman and start winning gold medals in women’s classifications tomorrow. 

Terf is a foul slur usually accompanied by threats of beatings, rapes and murder to women who refuse to cater to men’s fragile ego’s and most notably their autogynephila and fetishes. 
I refuse to be called names by woke weirdos like you who think women should die when all we want is to make men get out of our faces, out of our sports and out of out bathrooms. We dont want them to die, we want them to act like a normal human being. Not a anime doll. But you just echo what they teach you. 

Next time you call someone trash please re-read this message and realize i could have just insulted you right back. But i didnt do that. Now try and see who is the one between us two capable of calm and rational thought and who has used cursewords as their only retort to a woman standing up for herself."
98,QueenRowana,"They’re men. The text says nothing about qualification. I wouldnt want to be treated by an unqualfied woman either. But i dint want to be cared for by a man perion.  These are men, not “trans women!?!!” And yes they are attempting to steal women only spaces. They are men. It’s their ultimate goal it seems."
99,QueenRowana,Correct i didn’t write it. But i had not seen it on this sub before and loved it. I agree with it completely. Men can get the hell out if womens spaces. They are not welcome. And diaper fetishists too by the way sir!
100,auklet,"Terf is used as a slur, by trans rights activists. You'll often hear it in phrases such as ""kill all terfs.""  I think many ""terfs"" agree that ""terf""  is an accurate term when used to mean ""woman who doesn't agree that a man can become a woman."" But trans activists use it to mean, ""Person who refuses to validate my claim to be a woman and therefore should be humiliated, ostracized, and murdered. """

If you remove delusions of infinite genders, and hedonistic pornographer women being glorified, then I can get behind feminism. I mean, I'm still gonna call obese, dyed haired women ""SJWs""; and I'm sure as hell not denying that men are biologically stronger than women, but other non-sexually-immoral ideologies you guys hold are fine by me."
107,QueenRowana,"I’m not against normal men who mind their own business at all. Men can be great. I’m only against trans people if they are men trying to get away with stuff and get into female spaces by wearing dresses and turning their penis inside out or even just claiming they are women while they arent even remotely trying, they are literally just men. I have little to no trouble with women who try to become men. They don’t bother me usually. I say good luck to them. They are still weird but I wish them luck fitting in with men. But men trying to be women. Yeah i have something against them and i will fight against them and for women.  

Every day. 

Again. Have a nice day."
108,QueenRowana,"I didnt write it. I do agree with it though. 

I never said YOU were a man. I just said ‘men’ but if you felt like i was talking about you go off i guess. 

And are you sure you’re a woman. Isn’t that enforcing a gender binary which could hurt trans peoples feelings? (Big sarcasm in case you didn’t get that)"
109,QueenRowana,"I am indeed not bothered at all by that. Because i care about women and preserving our spaces, not about the fragile ego’s of men who like to wear dresses and want to be called “ma’am”"
110,QueenRowana,That dont mean it’s untrue though. Men with a trans fetish are a danger to women. Whether i wrote it or not doesnt make it false.
111,auklet,"Radical feminists,  ftom what I read, see ""sex work"" including porn as exploitative."

Lol. It’s 50% “grr i’m not allowed in womens [fill in here: bathroom, locker room, rape shelter, prison] Let’s put on a dress and waltz in, no one will dare stop me”. These are predators out to get weak women and many cases are documented of  so called “trans women” (men) getting permission to go to female prision instead of male and at the very least creeping the fuck out of vulnerable women and at worst rape and hurt them. Many cases about men freaking out for not being admitted to women rape shelters. Cases of men sendingvdeath threats to lesbians who refuse to fuck men with dicks. Of pedophiles who claim to be trans to get lowered sentences. Of men going Into womens bathrooms with ugly dresses and terrible fake wigs just for fun and to terrify women in a space where once they would have come to get away from men. 

And 50% “ i just want to have tits to play with and be submissive slut in bed”. Of which the last one i will admit are usually not quite as nefarious. But they’re definitely AGP."
117,QueenRowana,"Fetish? Lol i have literally 0 fetishes.  Your “tendencies” are a fetish. 
I care about women enough to not want men with dicks forcing themselves into lesbian spaces, into women rape shelters, into womens locker rooms, toilets and prisons.  If your main objective is forcing women to just lie down and take it while men like you walk all over them you are not a feminist."

119,QueenRowana,"Fascination with “lady dick”? I have never used that word except to express my disgust at the word. Maybe you mistook my disgusted frustration at men referring to penises as a “girldick” for fascination, HalfBreed?

Men like you saying stuff like ‘kill terfs’ are inciting violence against women yet somehow i’m the one who doesnt care about women? Thats cute dude! Such a male thing to do!

166,bishhpls,"If something sums up these people's utter hatred and contempt for women, this is it. The fact they are demanding women who have been traumatised by men and their male bodies allow them into the one space that is meant to be totally free of those traumatic elements, simply to validate their 'true and honest womanhood' is nothing short of horrifying. If a literal rape crisis centre isn't safe, where is?

They want to allow men who have a sexual fetish regarding objectifying women into a slew of outdated sexist stereotypes into a place where women are healing from sexual trauma. Where they will most likely exude exhibitionism and sexually harass these vulnerable women. All for sexual gratification and their own validation. TIMs claim to need these centres, and some may, but I believe the number of them that truly need shelter may be quite low and the rest are just creepy boundary pushing AGPs. Yet when they are offered separate accommodations away from the women, that just isn't good enough, they must be treated as exactly the same as a biological woman, even though they are NOT the same and belong to the group who victimised the women in the first place.

175,Crazedoutweirdo,"Just willing to point out that this was all started because an MTF who wanted to be a therapist for women there got turned down because patients would not feel at ease having a biological male as a therapist after experiencing violence/sexual violence at the hands of males.

This person filed a complaint because she felt it was discriminatory that patients would refuse a certain therapist that triggered their PTSD.    
In their testimony they complained that the center refused to acknowledge their competence as a therapist.  
Let's break this down, like slowly.    
This person is filing a complaint because a crisis center did not recognize her competence as a therapist.  
She is such an amazing and considerate therapist, she files a complaint in an attempt to reduce funding for that center, and consequently access to that center for those who need it.  
She is such a good therapist that she literally attempted to shut down a rape crisis center because it placed the PTSD requirements and needs of its patients AHEAD OF HER OWN NEED FOR VALIDATION.  
Yet TERFs are the problem here ??? No, the problem here is whoever places a trans person's want/need for validation ahead of the wants and needs of rape victims, including dudes who think so hard that they are women that they think they know better than women what women want and need."

Oh I'm so sorry that you were raped, but you still understand that *not all men* do that, right? You musnt forget to say that before and after you apologetically share what happened to you. 

Oh I'm sorry the rape crisis center was defunded by a man, but I hope you understand it's because those women were bigots for wanting to heal privately and with dignity. Their wants outweigh your needs, because as a woman, you are everything they wish they were. This is ""privledge"", not objectification. 

Oh I'm so so sorry to hear you didnt place in your sport after training your whole life because men now compete in womens sports. But the fact they get the limited scholarships and opportunities for women, should really be an inspiration for you to just work harder and be quietly supportive.

Oh I'm so so VERY sorry that abortions are punishable by a life sentence in certain states and getting harder and harder to access, but it seems so exclusionary since transwomen dont get to experience this, so we shouldn't focus on it. The most important thing is that everything is about transwomen all the time. If it's not, then it's about how it hurts them that it's not, and THAT is the important peice of every puzzle. 

Oh, you dont like the red robes they are rolling out...I'm so so so sorry about that. But it's because you are lucky enough to be born a woman. I wish I was a woman, red is definitely my color and the cap hides my male pattern baldness UwU"

362,Lady_Montgomery,"Odd how you can't say you wish for mentally ill people to get the help they deserve and need, instead of being destroyed by so-called doctors for a profit. Yet demanding that women get raped to death and or tortured to death is perfectly healthy and normal and should be allowed in the name of free speech. It's also perfectly normal that ""women"" want other women to get raped to death. We say that all the time, so normal and perfectly healthy, so ultra feminine.

401,Lady_Montgomery,Well keep a look out on r/thisneverhappens  when something happens it will be posted there. Its not a matter of if. Thinking you are of the opposite sex is a symptom of at least metal instability (imo a symptom of mental illness) and mental instability can (not necessarily) lead to deadly situations. So it just a waiting game for now.
402,Lady_Montgomery,"When you think you are the opposite sex you are most definitely mentally ill. Its like saying you are born in the wrong body and that you are an alien from galaxy 1000 miles away. It's not real. It's a mask for something else. A personality disorder, childhood trauma, even trauma in later life, autism, internalized homophobia, internalized misogyny, plain old misogyny (when it comes to men claiming to be women) etc. It's a symptom. Not an actual thing. But it's also a multi billion business that preys on the unstable. As long as there are people that can make a shit load of money on the mentally disturbed they will. Providing actual help doesn't make people as much money. And as long as people sign a contract that says informed consent, they can actually get away with it. It's vile and grotesque.

Every single person that claims to be of the opposite gender is at least highly mentally unstable and often times mentally ill."
403,denverkris,"Exactly. Sorry, but I'm a huge fan of kind shaming. No one needs to know about that shit."

410,EquivalentApple,"I don't want to type the name out in case he namesearches himself, but the crayon eater's username is very familiar. I think I've seen troubling things he said pop up on other subs.

actually, Google that username if you want to report him. He has a thread on the green fruit site. They know exactly who he is."
411,Eowyn19,Exactly what I was thinking. It’s already happened. Hardly any libfems even know about trans criminals because discussing them is “literally violence”.
412,0WatcherintheWater0,"You seem to not understand modern gender theory. What makes someone a certain gender is a combination of three things. 1) identity (what gender you see yourself as), 2) body (what physical characteristics society prescribes to different genders), and 3) presentation (what behaviors are prescribed to certain genders, an example would be gender roles). You’ll notice that chromosomes have nothing to do with it. So long as Trans people fit two out of those three things, they **are** the opposite gender, your opinion on the subject is irrelevant.  They aren’t mentally ill. Gender dysphoria still is a mental illness, of course, but for separate reasons, and a lot of trans people aren’t dysphoric.

Also, it’s not a mask, sure there are trans people who change in order to cover up past trauma, but the vast majority are sincere in their beliefs. 

May I ask, what do you think would actually help trans people beyond surgery? Therapy wouldn’t do anything beyond maybe making them more suicidal, that’s for sure."
413,FTThrowAway123,"Report to the [FBI](https://tips.fbi.gov/). You can submit a tip online. I've submitted tips twice before. Both times an agent called me back promptly and seemed to take it seriously.  

Also, the [U.S. Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/how-do-i/report-suspicious-activity) has suggestions.  

>""If You See Something, Say Something®"" is a national campaign that raises public awareness of the indicators of terrorism and terrorism-related crime, as well as the importance of reporting suspicious activity to state and local law enforcement.  

I'll be reporting to both. This is above Reddits paygrade, nor do I trust them to actually do anything about it."
414,2or3thingsIknow,"Yep, he's a real psycho that one."
415,Lady_Montgomery,"I heard all that bs before and it's a cry for attention. There males and females. Gender roles are bs. Chromosomes determine your sex, which equals your gender. The end. Basic biology. So called trans people need psychological help to determine what is truly the matter with them: a personality disorder, autism, trauma (sexual or other wise), internalized homophobia/misogyny. The only reason it isn't qualified as a mental disorder officially is because it has become a multi billion industry. The profits made to mutilate so called transgenders are so incredibly high. So of course they want the medical world to say its okay and normal. Trans people do not exist. It's as simple as that. A d you know it too else you wouldn't be commenting here. You are looking for validation from people who are telling you the truth. If you can convince us, you can convince yourself. I wish you the best. And I hope you find proper help to help you with either you personality disorder or your past trauma you haven't dealt with yet. Good luck.

BTW if you aren't dysphoric, no need to mutilate your body either and pump it full with hormones your body isnt meant to produce. You know doing that when you aren't dysphoric doesn't make sense."

You're not a man. You can scream it as loudly as you like, but it won't make reality any different. You don't want to be a woman, I get that. I can't blame you. The world can be kinda shitty for us. However, you can't just opt-out of reality. I can say I’m a walrus --but if I show up on a beach none of the other walruses are going to be particularly impressed me and zero percent of them will buy it. As for the rest of what I wrote, the concept remains the same so I don't see a point in editing it. 

( Correction: in order to not feed into delusional thinking I did indeed edit pronouns in my previous comment in order to reflect reality.) 

You understood it clearly enough. You don't have to be a girly girl, you can have short hair, you can have your breasts removed--you can take hormones if you want because its your body and you can do what you want with it --but how you express your personal aesthetics has exactly zero impact on biological fact.  You're still a woman and the rest of the world has no obligation to play along with your fantasy. You need to accept who you actually are, a non conformist  woman, instead of making up a whole new person to distance yourself from the things you dislike about the world and your body."

538,tr330fsn4rk,"That sub is a joke. I’d never even visited the page and they banned me 🙄 Pretty sure that’s against Reddit rules, but whatever."
539,yesisaiditxx,"That’s why I made another reddit account to post in radfem communities because I knew I couldn’t comment on even a funny meme elsewhere without getting banned and attacked. 

Turns out, I enjoy this corner of reddit more than all the other increasingly ridiculous subs and now am hardly ever on my “actual” account. So, this is my actual account :) I’d take participating in these spaces over the rest if that’s how it has to be. 

I don’t mean any disrespect to her (the mod) but someone who obviously thinks sex work is a fine way to make money and continuously responds with condescension when someone confesses details of her rape? Dear, her ability to think outside the rules of the TRA cult is barely there, if at all. So many people on reddit get a thrill out of witch (pun heh) hunting “terfs”. You’d think maybe we could see this is the internet and allow for people to still post in your subs as long as what they post was appropriate...but we have long left the shores of reason.

Even with all of that, this is a shocking level of gaslighty scuminess. Even if someone believes ""trans women are women"", they are still in the same ""AMAB"" category as ""cis men"". But of course a traumatic response towards ""AMAB"" people isn't valid by their standards. In what universe is telling someone who isn't hurting anyone to ""manage your trauma like everyone else"" appropriate? There's something really insidious about this that I can't quite put my finger on, it's as if the mod feels entitled to your emotional state, as if the insides of your brain are obligated to be free of any thoughtcrimes against TIMs. This framing of trauma as something ""problematic"" that you basically need to get over for the benefit of others is absolutely vile."

The truth is lies, and lies are truth. Once enough people start proclaiming 2 plus 2 is five, others will follow. The social acceptance is too important to them. We are being socially engineered to believe bizarre and illogical concepts. 

These women who don't give a fuck they're walking back women's rights 120 years and who deride, mock and exclude women concerned for the status of our sex are absolute traitors."

Then they called me a terf.

I am so concerned about the ongoing suppression of any thoughts that deviate from the party line.

Why is it ok to call people terfs? Is their “movement” a house of cards that they fear any information or perspective that differs, will collapse the trans lobby?

What other group of people are threatened and silenced in our society now? 

Why is it allowed?"

Well, sorry for having been raped and abused and not healing fast enough from it, your majesty. Like wtf?!?"

586,politipoop,"Exactly! These people want me to stay home and quiet while they take over our hard fought for spaces? Fuck all of that!

At the moment a transwoman is trying to say that I’m sexist and rely on stereotypes. I’m a woman. I don’t need to rely on stereotypes to be a woman, a just am a woman! The cheek of some of these people.

(I must say that this is the only trans person that I’ve ever met or spoken to that believe that he is now a female, and really hates women, with a passion it seems. I assume because he can never be one. He’s not converting anyone to his cause of opening up all women’s spaces to men.)"

601,politipoop,"I’m glad I know now, and I’m glad others know about it too. The way that mod tried to bully me is exactly what another transwoman is also trying to do to me :D Exactly the same points: “your ptsd is nothing”, “my feelings are more important than women’s safety”, “get over it”.

So scary how they seem to have the same points when it comes to hating women and trying to keep us quiet, good little slaves.

Years ago though, that used to be actual homophobic, super religious people on Twitter who have serious problems with gay and GNC people in the first place.

They transformed the tree of life, a symbol of the Goddess and creation, into a cross which is no less than a dead tree in which a dead man is nailed. They substituted Lilith with a male-born subservient Eve. They replace Myrine, also known as Marian, a moon/sea-goddess, known as mother of all gods, with a virgin subservient, completely null Mary, the virgin mother of god who is merely a vessel in an all-male creation myth. They subverted the symbolism of the cauldron to the chalice containing the blood of Christ (could it be more necrophiliac and cannibalistic than that?). I could go on and on. All they did with female-centric mythology was subvert all life-giving, life-creating symbols to all-male ""creators"" who worship death and destruction."

626,knight_siegmeyer,"Completely understand. It's one of the more frustrating aspects of this dumb bathroom debate. Mostly because I feel people with so called good intentions don't wanna admit that people do bad things. Well, correction, men do bad things to women and little girls and it's somehow outside the realm of their understanding that YES men would certainly lie to take advantage of a situation to gain access to someone vulnerable. And funnily enough, men agree on some level that men can't be trusted. 

The arguement 'oh well, if they want to assault women a law against not being in the bathroom won't stop them' which, true it won't. But by that same logic we just shouldn't have gun control cuz 'people are gonna get guns illegally if they want them'. But a law is the law and having a societal barrier that says 'men should not be in women's bathrooms' is more of a deterrent than just breaking it down and saying 'yep! Men welcomed! Go on in boys!'    

I hope you're doing well, too. That sub can kick rocks."
627,06549r,"Not forever. They are losing the sympathetic ignorance that gave them so much power. Every single time there’s a “controversy” and they reply with their nonsense more people are waking up.

But the whole societal idea that it's okay to suppress and silence speech you disagree with but totally not okay to do the same to anybody you agree with is becoming more and more acceptable. If you don't support free speech for those you disagree with, you do not support free speech at all. That cornerstone of free speech is totally eroded. Those gullible people are being taken advantage of and encouraged and propagandized to in order to pass through laws and societal norm changes. We are not free any longer.

They can go fuck themselves. Stay strong."
647,politipoop,"I really hope so. But I agree, once we wake up there is no turning back. I can’t believe that I ever was one of those people pretending that men are women, and saying that children should be abused as tortured so the can “transition”.

We need everyone to wake up fast, as it is getting way out of hand."
648,politipoop,:D
649,GeorgiaMRomero,"Haven’t they already chipped it? 

If mods can mute you, if you can get banned for saying transwomen are not females and that biology can’t be erased,  if you get called a terf for speaking our truth: where are our free speech rights?"
650,06549r,TIMs tend to spend a lot of time online in general (and work in the tech field). They try to infiltrate in so many things to control from within.. twitter is one example. They even manipulate articles and highlights in the news section.
651,griffxx,There are multiple Subreddits where members are also members of T_D.
652,griffxx,"It's this whole Queer Women's perspective that homosexual Lesbians, unlike the them, don't believe the mantra ""Trans women are women."" This is a terrorible timeline for young lesbians. Lesbians realized first these were just feminized straight men."
653,griffxx,r - AgainstHateSubreddits
654,Shrimpy_monsters,"Exactly. 

Seriously tho, that place (as much as I like some of the art posted) gets so much wrong. Silly is exactly what I think of."
655,CorporalWotjek,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24313294
656,06549r,"I was one too, completely ignorant because because I blindly trusted their claims. A lot of them are mentally ill *and* deluded which is a dangerous combo, I remember lurking the MTF sub years ago and one of them said his neovagina self-lubricated just like a real one, I was like wow. Now I know what a load of bs that was."
657,bishhpls,"Okay and you could say that for a lot of subs though. 
It's not okay to persecute people and do the equivalent of a yellow star on the chest for following a sub."
658,politipoop,"How did we get to this point? Where lesbians are being told that they’re transphobic and bigoted for not wanting to sleep with males. It’s just wrong, and actually rape if those poor women are successfully coerced.

It’s nightmarish."
659,ESyzygy,"I only just realized. If you look thru my comment history I used to stand up for trans people saying straight people are teed but then I finally realized that I was really stupid.

Some trans people don’t do that, but a lot do."
660,politipoop,"I saw it and thought the art and some memes were enjoyable, but didn’t realise how silly it really is. And you’ve really found the prefect word: silly! A bit juvenile, and feeling threatened if anyone uses the “wrong” language."
661,politipoop,Oh shit.
662,politipoop,"It is scary. It’s so weird how people with mental health problems have blackmailed us into pretending we also have those delusions. I have nothing against people with mental health problems, I’ve got plenty myself, but I don’t tell everyone else to change laws just to make me happy."
663,griffxx,All those Subreddits have members who are also members of T_D. These same members were on r/worldnews today hoping that nCoronavirus would wipeout a good portion of the Chinese population.
664,griffxx,"Because the TQ+++ coopted the LGB. This was all done with the lie of Stonewall and 2 generations of LGBTQ students indoctrinated on College and University campuses with Queer Theory and Gender Studies classes. The 2nd generation also was indoctrinated on Tumblr.

The problem with both generations is they either don't want to study LGB History or the History they are reading has been adulterated with a Transwashed Narrative."
665,griffxx,"We were talking about being masstagged. The MODs have special tools were they can see the tags, so they don't have to go through the post histories. But Trans people who aren't MOD probably still look at the comment section."
666,bishhpls,Doesn't mean all of the people there support that and deserve to be tarred with the same brush due to the actions of a minority.
667,politipoop,"I heard that you can’t just take something like lgb history, it’s now lgbtq history or something. Like a lot of the courses are changing specifically to include this stuff."
668,ESyzygy,Oh I meant that I used to support tans before I got called a TERF for talking about pregnancy.
669,griffxx,"This is a Sub for women, whose only transgressions is that they recognize the threat to their Civil Rights Movement and the strides that have been made, by Trans Identity politics. 

We don't need you here to try to state a case of T_D and not all Sub members. The corruption, graft, misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia anti-Semitism, racism and the shredding of Constitutional laws of the Trump Administration will be taught in  Political Science, Economics and History departments for decades to come."
670,griffxx,Yes they are.
671,griffxx,"I'm just letting you know, that if you have tools now. You might already be tagged."
672,bishhpls,"Were you paying any attention to the previous Obama administrations violations by any chance?

And I am well aware of what this sub is for, btw. I'm GC and a woman, and I contribute regularly to GC subs. And I'm not a trump supporter here to defend him, I'm simply a realist and equal opportunity political party and candidate skeptic, democrat or republican I don't trust you.

 I don't like *any* politicians. But Obama was just as bad, esp on grace violations of law and process, as well as war crimes, he was just the liberal media's golden boy and it wasn't publicised. Even though the economy was a mess. I think it's disingenuous to think Trump is the only problem and that all his supporters are pitch fork wielding racists when the same problems existed long before trump."
673,politipoop,It’s so insidious.
674,ESyzygy,"Ok! Thanks! 

I don’t really care if they kick me out of AL- I still have a bunch of other groups. I’ll miss the romance and stuff, but I bet that’s on TL too."

676,girl_undone,This belongs on r/TrollGC for future reference.

686,06549r,"The main reason why they attack white women is a because they want to be put in a “victim” position in their heads. 

They talk like stereotypical SJW WOC. Everything is a stereotype for them, like a fantasy life."
687,PrayandThrowaway,Apparently I’m white! Looks like I don’t know my own ethnicity 🤷🏻‍♀️
688,AbolishGender,"Same.  I’ve been semi-out as a radfem for a while, but recently I’ve stopped playing their bullshit language games and openly calling TIMs men.  Most of the women I know who agree with me are WOC (like myself)."
689,PsychicCaramelle,They want to be able to slag off women without appearing like just your average misogynist - going after 'white women' instead of just 'women' is how they try and hide their true nature.
690,PassRestProd,"I’m in complete agreement. I’ve seen so many Twitter conversations that go like this, with the inevitable, “Oh, wow, this post sure took off! By the way, since you’re here...” It’s pathetic how common it is to see - I’m curious if it really works, tbh, or if the cold hard reality of TRAs being too self-absorbed to help means the “burden” falls on ww trying to buy their way into being woke, and, by then, maybe a handful actually follow through."
691,LesbianPrincess-,"Because it’s made in satire by a radfem instead of a TRA? I think once in a while is fine, but you have a good point too. 🤔"

694,PrayandThrowaway,Wait there’s Black Panther youth? :0 what do you do there? That’s pretty cool!
695,LesbianPrincess-,"Yep, true.

But is once a month posting something like it really so bad? OP posts a ton of other stuff that is relevant of TRAs actually dehumanizing us/calling us slurs."
696,Detroitaa,Not terribly glamorous. I helped with the free breakfast program.
697,moonflower,I didn't say it was ''bad'' - you can do what you like in your own subreddit - you can fill it with made up ''satire'' if you like - I'm only saying it weakens what *was* the original purpose of the subreddit
698,LesbianPrincess-,"I wasn’t implying that you actually sad it was “bad” — it’s the connotation, obviously. I’m just playing devil’s advocate and sticking up for OP. I’m also agreeing with you."
699,moonflower,"I'm not attacking OP, but I can see how you might interpret my view as an attack which needs to be defended against.

You are not agreeing with me, you are defending against my view and supporting this kind of post - that is not agreeing with me, that is pretty much *disagreeing* with me, unless you are basically saying ''Yes I agree that this kind of post weakens the purpose of the subreddit but I think it should be allowed because there's nothing wrong with weakening the purpose of the subreddit''."
700,LesbianPrincess-,"I don’t think you’re attacking her at all — in fact, I hate the liberal use of the word “attack” because it sounds so dramatic and violent.

I’ve said I actually SEE your point and agree with you. Once again, I was playing devil’s advocate on OP’s part. I never said it SHOULD be allowed, I’m just using Socratic questioning to *ask* if it’s okay once in a while. That doesn’t mean I think it should be posted. 

I’m not supporting this kind of post. Calm down."
701,moonflower,"You said you were ''sticking up for'' OP which implies that OP is under some kind of attack and needs to be defended.

You say you were ''asking'' if it should be allowed, but why would you even ask, if you didn't think it should be allowed? The very question suggests that you are defending that it should be allowed, as if I have said it shouldn't be, which I didn't.

Also I don't need to ''calm down'', and there is nothing to be gained by telling me to do so, unless your aim is to imply that I have lost control and become hysterical."

704,,FEMINISM IS A TERF
705,,[deleted]
706,protozoanpussy,"I really wish someone had this conversation with me when I was 12. I spent my young teenage years exposing myself to older men online and feeling so cool for it. I’m currently in an extremely toxic relationship with a man 30 years my senior. The damage I’ve caused myself is probably irreparable. I don’t feel empowered, I feel used and silly."
707,fogellegof,Lol implicitly this means that TiMs are predators.
708,,I wish I’d had older and wiser women to help me to navigate the dating world when I was young and dumb(er). I’d have avoided several toxic relationships and probably wouldn’t have been sexually assaulted.
709,MadSeaPhoenix,Kind of glad as it’s making the word lose its efficacy.
710,moonflower,"I think perhaps the accusation of being 'terfs' wasn't based on that comment, but on previous comments not shown here - this looks like a grudge carried over from another conversation"

713,MonoRubric,"So is biology, reality, what else is a terf?"

Hope things get better, we are your sisters here and we have your back! You got this! You’re way stronger than you know. ♡"
716,Watches_watches,You're not damaged and you can leave that relationship and be successful in life. I believe in you.
717,MonoRubric,You are never damaged for being exploited.
718,EgregiousWeasel,"You aren't damaged. You're not ""irreparable."" It's never too late to start being kinder to yourself. Can you leave this relationship safely? You're too precious to waste any more time with this man."
719,LesbianPrincess-,They are
720,,"tbh i've finally had this coalesce in my mind and i've been trying to bring it up at every opportunity. the \*mere engagement in trans identification\* is abusive because it is \*gaslighting\*. I have not seen \*one\* man in a dress who doesn't engage in the abusive factors of 1) denying reality (with the expectation that those he demands deny it as well) and 2) threatening violence (on himself or others) when or even just at the possibility that people don't comply with his demands of reality denial. (Threats to 't\*rfs' or 'transphobes' and threats to himself through threatening suicide or implying that not denying reality will force others to kill themselves.) 

&#x200B;

i now believe (and have seen no evidence otherwise) that these men who ""identify as women"" are unilaterally abusers, because at the bare minimum their gaslighting is abusive. with abuse comes predatory behavior, and thank you for saying this because i had not thought about that aspect of it too. the more time i spend here and on sister subs and read news articles (like the [recent win by a young man with pink hair to have unrestricted access to all the masturbatory aid he needed in the form of real live uncensored vulnerable teenage women](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/11/14/palatine-schaumburg-high-school-district-votes-to-give-transgeder-students-unrestricted-locker-room-access/)) the more i am convinced that every single one is a narcissistic abusive predator."
721,LesbianPrincess-,"I know that feeling and can SO relate, but please don’t blame yourself. On the plus side, at least we can warn other women now :) Especially younger ones. Let’s use that wisdom to protect other women <3 Even though it came at a shitty cost."
722,LesbianPrincess-,"So? I see this wayyyyyyy too much on tumblr. It’s ridiculous. People will call women “terfs” all the time in an attempt to disprove our points. It’s still just as bad. 

But honestly I have seen people calling this stuff terfy, especially when we talk about patriarchy. Because calling out patriarchy and men’s oppression of women is offensive to TIMs."
723,,"Regardless of what the accusation was based on, reblogging that particular post with that kind of commentary is a shitty thing to do."

731,protozoanpussy,"Thank you. It’s hard for me to believe that I was exploited because I feel like I consented and willingly participated in everything that happened to me. Now that I’m slightly older, I am starting to think I was groomed. It’s hard to remember how it all started though because I was “dating” a 30 year old online before I even had my first period. I think I’ve blocked a lot of it out.

733,2or3thingsIknow,This. They 100% are. They like being abusive males.
734,,Thank you <3 You’re right
735,SometimesJacka,"So true. 

In addition because there are less boundaries between the communities they get really paranoid and start flagging any sort of woman centered content as ‘terf-y’. Too much of social faux pas for them to be caught anywhere near ‘terf’ content or people. 

It’s funny when the opposite happens — rad fems reblogging TRA or QT content. The notes on those posts are just hilarious. Rad fems acknowledge good posts regardless of the poster, so not only do TRAs / QT have to be careful about who they follow and what they reblog, they have to make sure their content doesn’t appeal to radical feminists either. 


But yes the witch hunts for ‘terfs’ on tumblr is a real thing."
736,2or3thingsIknow,This guy thinks trans males can gestate babies. Just an FYI. Seems to dislike actual feminists.
737,moonflower,Because your title implied that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc - but I think the person who called them 'terfs' was very likely referring back to a previous discussion
738,moonflower,You lost me - I don't know who you are criticising - the OP here or the commenter in the linked page ...?

I was in radfem tumblr, and below these comments there were radfems/women calling him out. But I could only fit so much into a screenshot. 

Radfem tumblr is the best tumblr! So much wisdom there. & REALLY cool, smart, brilliant, hilarious women. It feels like a true sisterhood. Pretty inspiring actually. <3

743,LesbianPrincess-,"Wait, seriously? It’s a dude? Wow. 

Explains the fragile ego, the need to “correct” women, the incessant arguing, refusal to admit that he’s wrong and doesn’t know what he’s talking about, etc."
744,olatundew,"At best, this makes the accusation of TERF foolish and strategically misguided. We don't know if there was prior context, but we *do* know that they chose to spin off the wording used in the previous comment."
745,LesbianPrincess-,Nah. Lol
746,,The commenter in the linked page. It was a post about girls being taken advantage of. You’d have to be a special kind of asshole to derail that to point out a “terf”
747,LesbianPrincess-,You commented on my post. 😹😹 Thank you! That’s a compliment.
748,2or3thingsIknow,Looks that way. Posts on GenderCriticalGuys (gets almost no upvotes).
749,moonflower,"Yes, but that's another issue. Are you disagreeing with anything I said?"
750,moonflower,"You said: ""Mentioning anything about patriarchy, exploitation and trauma are ‘terfy’ now"" ... how is that *not* implying that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc?

You're denying what's right in front of you and laughing about it."
751,moonflower,"Oh yes, of course it was inappropriate, but the point I was making was that the accusation of 'terf' probably wasn't based on those comments - and we already know that people who use 'terf' as a derogatory term wouldn't be interested in discussing anything about how to protect female people, so they probably didn't even think about the current discussion, only concerned about silencing 'terfs'"
752,,[removed]
753,LesbianPrincess-,"Gee, I wonder why! What a loser lol. He should be banned from this subreddit. I reported the rude comments but maybe mods haven’t gotten to them yet 🤷‍♀️"
754,olatundew,"Well, if we're splitting hairs, I disagree that it's ""very likely"" that this was in response to a previous comment.

More to the point, I do think that this part of the same issue - how do we have constructive conversations about complicated gender issues?"
755,LesbianPrincess-,"What exactly am I denying? I’m just disagreeing with you. 

Honestly, you’ve been very rude to me in the past and I would like to be done with this convo. I actually know how tumblr works and this stuff is all too common. Plus there are too many users on there for there to be people who remember users’ “prior terfy conversations” or whatever. Men call us terfs for being feminists. Period. 

Bye.

Edit: Apparently the person I'm talking to is a MALE! What a surprise. Dominating the conversation and telling women that we don't know what we're talking about. He should be banned. Mansplaining at its finest, and he has the audacity to call himself a feminist. Wow."
756,,"Exactly, so that person is a trash gremlin regardless of what they were referencing. So it doesn't really matter."
757,LesbianPrincess-,"😹😹😹 We get it, you’re insecure and projecting because of your small penis. Bye."
758,moonflower,"Do you really think it is at all likely that this person called them 'terfs' based solely on those comments, with no previous history between them?"
759,moonflower,"You are denying that your title implies that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc.

Also, how ironic that you complain of people who judge current comments based on prior conversations, at the same time as you are doing that exact same thing to me - you are the one who is being rude here, and rude in the past - way ruder than I have ever been to you.

I disagree with things that you say, and call you out on your bad behaviour, and you interpret that as ''rudeness'' and use it as an excuse to be even more rude to me."
760,moonflower,I think it does matter if OP is misrepresenting the situation
761,2or3thingsIknow,"Yes, because that is what these clownfish do. They label anything and everything terf because they cannot answer. Stop pretending you haven't seen this."
762,olatundew,"That's a slightly different claim from the original one, but yes - I've seen TERF used in some pretty atrocious ways (e.g. ""I'm going to rape you, you fucking TERF"") so I wouldn't rule it out. Plus, this particular comment they were responding to was purposeful and well-written, and seemed to be the beginning of a new conversation - so it seems a non-sequiter for it to have been part of an ongoing (quite bitter) dialogue."
763,LesbianPrincess-,"I’m not denying it. My “Nah. Lol” was just dismissing what you were saying. 

I’m just saying I don’t have time to argue with you when you’ve been rude in the past. Move along. Blocking you because I don’t have time for this weird drama. Lol. And not sure what “bad behavior” you’re referencing. Pretty weird."
764,,There's no actual evidence that the situation is being misrepresented though???
765,moonflower,Actually I have never seen anyone called a 'terf' unless they have said something which suggests that they believe that male people cannot become female
766,moonflower,I don't really understand your reasoning at all - I came to the opposite conclusion based on exactly the same perception that it was a new conversation and *therefore* inappropriate to be calling anyone 'terfs' in response to the subject matter - much more likely that the person calling them 'terfs' was referring to a different conversation
767,moonflower,"OK, we'll see if you really do block me - perhaps that means I will be free to speak my views in future without you being rude and denying reality all over my comments eh"
768,moonflower,"Not on the linked page, no, but I think it's very likely that the accusation of 'terf' was in reference to a previous encounter and not based on the shown comments"
769,2or3thingsIknow,Male people are male people. Not female. Males. Stop fucking colonizing us you sick bastards. I'm done playing nice with you creeps.
770,olatundew,"That's because we're talking about two different scenarios. I'm saying this doesn't look like an out-of-context snippet of conversation, you're saying it does look like there is a background context to their relationship. Both could be true, or neither."
771,,[deleted]
772,zombieeezzz,Holy shit. Shut up. You keep repeating this point and no one cares.
773,,You think it’s very likely. Which means you have no actual evidence and all of the drama you’re causing about this is based on nothing but a hunch that nobody even cares about.

777,crikeyuhoh,No its not surprising because men sexually assault women pretty regularly and talking about it does not equal bigotry.

They attack women on panels that speak about the harms of SRS being forced on children, the dangers of AGP in women's spaces. Like the women shelters that don't allow trans identified males for the safety of women that are routinely attacked. 

They target businesses designed for women. They lobby to have them lose their credentials. They commit to cyberstalking and releasing private information about women that speak openly about gender critical views."

Others said to report her rapist. I was empathic and also said that if she didn’t report him he would go on to rape other women. I finished with something like “Think of your sisters”. 

Some trans person must have looked at my profile or recognized my Reddit name and screamed at me online about having no right to comment, I was a pretend feminist, etc. 

Unfuckingbelievable!  Nothing I said was particularly feminist. It was just one woman empathasizing with the suffering of another woman at the hands of a man who attacked her. One human being reaching out to comfort another. 

The person who reacted so badly to not being centered in that moment was a man larping as a woman and doing it badly because he failed Female Bonding 101. 

He’s a man because his rage at me was so disproportionate to my comment and to the tone of the comment (empathy and sisterly advice which the woman asked for). 

He’s a man because he immediately jumped to who owns feminism when that wasn’t the topic. 

He’s a man because if it isn’t about him he can’t be quiet or move along. 

He’s a man because maybe the topic of sexual assault, rape, and friends who are attackers hit to close to home so he had to derail the thread."

Some people that are Gender Critical are not against trans people, some people are. But the gender critical society doesn't hate trans people for being trans, it's for being males and trying to demonize women a la calling them T*RFs and silencing the female perspective because it's ""only fair"" when usually it's not. 

Calling a female a ""menstruater"" or ""vagina haver"" while referring to all trans women as ""real women"" is 100% what GC is against. 

Not only that, but stereotyping women to an extreme and then calling yourself a woman, again, is shameful against women. 

Using misogyny while considering yourself a ""woman"" is, you guessed it, shameful. 

So while it seems hateful, it's more frustration that gender is so wholly valued over sex, which is REAL. 

Trans women that try to claim female issues like ovarian cancer, PCOS, PMS, ""menstruation symptoms""... and then suing or publicly shaming anybody that tells them otherwise is... just sick in the head.

Like I said, it varies though, person to person, and calling anyone who doesn't align with your patriarchal internalization a T*RF is pretty fucking stupid."

991,griffxx,"Basic will still remain true. There have been more complexities discovered in the creation of the boys and girls sex and genitals: there exist 25 genes across the 46 chromosomes that facilitate this development. But at the end of the day despite new information, humans still are binary sexed mammals; with a small percentage 1.7% having a spectrum of Intersex conditions.

All of this biological incoherence has been based on the ""inside baseball"" of geneticist.

No they still believe sex is a social construct."
992,griffxx,I think these are the rotation of their talking points.
993,Sbevette,"So, can trans people exist in your ideal world?"
994,connekt2net,Oh they're plenty accurate. :(
995,IndustrialDinge,"Definetly, theyre just projections. Like this one especially...
>""Tervs on GC aren't even feminist though. They are all just straight men."""
996,astropuddles,"Yes absolutely, trans people can exist in my ideal world.  

The difference is accepting and acknowledging the biological differences, and then building a community around that. 

For example, instead of going to gynocologists that studied the female genitalia their entire lives, there could be a third medical profession, that explicitly focuses on transgender genitalia, whether they are transitioning to be a male or female. 


I'd just really like if it trans people (specifically trans women though) would just be open to acknowledging this: Yes, there are biological differences between males and females. Yes, there can and SHOULD be female only spaces (just like there are trans only spaces). No, they are not the same as women, they are different and that doesn't make them bad. 

Female women should be able to write about periods and pregnancy without an angry mob of transgender women coming after them because it ""isn't inclusive"". For once, I'd like it if trans women were to say ""No, we can't actually relate to certain struggles of being a female, but we empathize and have our own struggles"" instead of saying ""We can't relate, so we don't care and we don't want to hear about it!"" That's just fucked up."
997,Think__Critically,"Well, not really. Sure, there could be trolls here. You have found your way here and others can too. 

But I understand it's easier to believe we're evil Nazi men and to attack that image of us instead of believing that many are just regular women. I'm certainly not a Nazi, nor am I balding or fat. Neither are most here."
998,griffxx,"Also thinking Tervs desire them. We've been saying NO officially for 8 years now. Cotton Ceiling 8th anniversary was March 12th, 2020."
999,Sbevette,"On the surface, this seems accepting, but it falls apart as I read on. Few people are denying biological reality, and nobody should be doing that. Gender is simply a series of social scripts that people follow. If trans women are excluded from female spaces then it's clear that they aren't considered women, so they aren't accepted.

As for the many issue I see brought up, they are not caused by trans people. Men claiming to be trans to sexually assault women, that can be solved by harsher sexual assault laws and more active demonization of predators. Women not being able to talk about their body and bodily functions, that can be solved by encouraging more openness and shunning people who are afraid of women's bodies. Trans women in female sports, just have leagues for the relevant characteristics like height and weight instead of gender. (This one is a hard arguement but consider someone like Michael Phelps, he's giant and has huge hands and feet, nobody, male or female, can compete with him solely because of his genetic advantage).

If you have concerns about trans lesbians but not those same concerns about straight trans women, that reveals something especially insidious. Women are women regardless of who they have sex with, it isn't an essential aspect of womanhood to have sex with men. 

The gynecologist thing is an obvious thing, that doctor can't help someone with a penis. If a post-op trans woman needs help, then it's reasonable.

Finally, nobody can prove their gender beyond a shadow of a doubt. Most people are pretty sure, but anything you could use to try to prove it has a counter example in the form of an intersex person or a person with a genetic abnormality. Think of when you see someone on the street. You probably know their gender within a few seconds. We aren't checking their blood and peeking down their pants, their clothing and general body structure are how we tell."
1000,IndustrialDinge,"Yeah i think its part of the narcicissm. Its literally inconceivable to them that a reality exists which they dont like, so they construct an elaborate fantasy.

I have never in my life even heard of this level of viciousness toward anything but women. This level of high excitement at the idea of extreme, intimate torture makes them feel nothing less than orgasmic... because now is it not only socially tolerated, it’s actively encouraged.

They consider it the same thing as simply calling out Nazis, but 1) I’ve never seen T*RFS advocate genocide, just insist that the biological reality of binary sex exists 2) I’ve seen extremely violent TRA protesters holding barbed wire bats, holding up female dolls hanging from nooses, making shoddy, homemade guillotines... in groups they give off this threatening vibe that they revel in because all of it is considered socially acceptable."

1169,hamatehllama,"This recent scientific article explains the current knowledge of gender dysphoria*. GD is a minor brain abnormality that changes the self identity and anxiety while most of the brain is like usual for the natal sex. Thus it's not surprising that it's the MTF population that are causing most of the problems while we hardly hear anything from the FTM population despite the fast growth caused by the ROGD epidemic. 

The paraphilic/AGP subpopulation of male GD is likely the most common offender because of their abnormal sexual drive. We've seen this with JY and other famous cases where multiple paraphilias overlap within the same individual. It's sad to see it has become taboo to talk about abnormal sexualities. Sexuality is by no means an area devoid of pathological behaviours. On the contrary, the intense sexual urge (especially for men) can cause a wide range of pathological/perverse/paraphilic behaviours.

I think another large chunk are people who ""don’t understand it"" and think that because it doesn’t make sense to them it must be intellectually above their heads and therefore super smart and enlightened and deferring to the loudest people is correct and deferring to the ""marginalized"" is woke and a harmless (to them) and easy way to ""be a good person"".

\*\*in here before some TRA tries to use handpicked, debunked claims of ""uhhhhhh ahcktually trans people won all the gay rights for you you're welcome uwu"" because if trans people actually DID achieve all those civil rights victories, then they should have had no problem fighting for their **own** acceptance without needing to hide behind the LGB shield and pretend same-sex love is AT ALL similar to dress-up"

1425,crispycherrypie,Hey at least he came right out and said it.
1426,ralph_A123,He does seem to recognize that he's using a slur since he *'d it.
1427,Glamalez,"This is what sexual frustration looks like on perverts. They will never be, or have real lesbians. They need to get over it."
1428,CallaAETHIOPICA,"It’s quite telling that these men think lesbian = terf. Their hatred for women is so disturbing, especially when you consider how much they want to wear our skin."
1429,hedaleksa,I’m tired of them thinking I’m offended by the word terf. Yes I exclude men from my dating pool. That’s what being a lesbian is. Call it whatever you want it doesn’t give their tantrums any validity.
1430,skankyferret,And this is why the tras are lesbophobic
1431,zhvair,Why is everyone in the comments assuming they're a man? I see this as a very AFAB nonbinary comment to make.

1433,barrbieboi,No. Words.
1434,gendercritics,"No I think they \*'d it so their tweet can't be shown when searching for the word terf. Because, you know, radfems are bullies who search the word terf so they can harass you (and not the other way around)"

1437,griffxx,Because Twitter is cracking down on the the T*rf word.
1438,Glamalez,"Really? Tell me if I’m being to optimistic... Don’t you think these perverts at some point will see they will never get lesbians, and they will never be seen as real women. So at some point they have to catch on, and think it’s just not worth it. I mean even if this generation doesn’t, the younger generations have to be watching and learning. Once they notice that they (transbians) are just seen as perverts and have zero respect or credibility perhaps they won’t want to be seen that way as well. It’s like carrying a sign saying I’m a lesbian fetishist. I lurk on MTF sometimes, and I’ve seen quite a few posts lately (over the last 4 months?) from them. The posts are basically about being depressed over being seen as fetishist, or asking how they’ll know if it’s just a fetish, because they don’t want to be a fetishist. Don’t you think that will grow? Is it just my wishful thinking?"
1439,YesPleaseMadam,"I don’t mean to offend but do you think pervs will wake up one day and say “ah, i’m done with the perv thing”? Of course they won’t. 

They might get discredited in as much as white guys driving white vans with no sign on them got discredited over time, but they won’t stop shaming and gaslighting women (even if they only get to do it to their mothers and possible wives). 

Mental illness when untreated only tends to become harder. Fetishes and kinks only tend to get more specific and weirder. Without proper care, by which i mean no pumping hormones and no social validation, but long hours in session to figure out how to change bad behavior and whatever therapy doctors might find that can help in the future (once they start doing their jobs of CARING for patients anyway) might help. 

I have no hope for men to just snap out of it. Don’t think you should either."
1440,griffxx,"Wishful thinking. Ultimately they will be corrected by others on the thread. They have to continue to reinforce:

Trans women are women and female. If this is false, it becomes an existential Crisis."
1441,Glamalez,"Not that they would stop being a pervert, but that they would hide it out of shame. I guess I expect dignity from men trying to rape lesbians, and that’s not a good use of time."

1449,meg-selv,No one wants to touch you weirdo
1450,lisasimpsonfan,I know we are all strong incredible people but they need to stop obsessing about us. Its like all they ever do is think about us.
1451,californiacandy,i thought they wanted to touch us??? what happened to raping terfs to teach us a lesson and pressuring lesbians to sleep with them?

1479,myousername,"""penis exclusionary""

LMAO everything is ""X exclusionary"" to them

We should start calling them ""logic exclusionary"""
1480,crikeyuhoh,"These people have messsssssy disaster minds. Nothing they say is consistent or logical. They are fixated on genitals and using that word as often as possible. Constantly in conversation, forcing their genitals into your mind like they want to do to your pants. Gender roles should not dictate a damn thing to anyone. They have nothing to do with anything except their own personal LARP and sexism. That is their business.  Many people in the community are GNC, and that used to be celebrated (at, you know...PRIDE). Now women need to know their place again. To be quiet and let the trans women dictate when autonomy is appropriate, or else."
1481,Randomosaur,How are lesbians a danger to trans people? It's the other way around.
1482,yesisaiditxx,Penis exclusionary lesbians would have been an oxymoron until recently. It makes me laugh just reading it. These people promote free sexuality and “boundaries” so much but you aren’t allowed to say that there’s a group of females out there who don’t want to be penetrated by a penis. Insane. No one is bugging gay men or “straight” trans women for not wanting to have sex with a “vagina haver”.
1483,ciaokhan,"This has reached astronomically levels of ignorance and entitlement. Lesbians are not long safe within the movement, we for sure need to gtfo"

1491,hamatehllama,"I would not be surprised if they will start to claim that marriage excludes them from having sex with wives. 

Sex is between consenting adults. There's no consent if people (especially women) can't reject offers. Exclusion is by far more important than inclusion in the domain of sexual intercourse."

1503,sojourner_truth_,"> Womxn is supposed to be a more ""inclusive"" term used to include TIMs and women of colour.

The TRA constantly try to wrap themselves in the cloak of other social movements that fought for justice. For example, glomming on to the success of the gay and lesbian rights movements. They also do that with racism. By making a new fake definition of the word ""woman"" that lumps TIMs and non-white women together, they get to pretend that anyone who is gender critical is a racist."
1504,TheHistoryMachine,">I am sure this male thinks he is ""more of a woman"" than real lesbians.

""There are two types of women -- cis women and real women."" -- TIMs"
1505,ZombieSazza,"Honestly this pisses me off, the term woman includes all women, I don’t see why they even need to change it.

Shit I use “folk” all the time and have had folk give me a hard time for not spelling it as “folx”. I’m a Scottish Highlander, I speak Gaelic, English and Doric. Folk is used in Doric all the time and is a gender neutral term akin to “y’all”, and I’ve had to fight folk with “please stop telling me I can’t use one of my languages just to appease random internet strangers.”

It’s just dumb."

1519,margiejamison,"When I have encountered it, it is always framed as being about not diluting feminism with concerns for men, that refusing to address racism in the lives of women is a principled stance. Either way, though, the implication is that nonwhite women have to wait until after white women get what they want for a feminism that will address their issues."
1520,sojourner_truth_,"I've seen none of that among gender critical women, and it sounds an awful lot like you want to *smear* GC as being inherently racist, and therefore worthy of being lumped in with alt-right, white supremacists and other dangerous people."
