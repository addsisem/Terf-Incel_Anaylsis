What is a ""TERF""? While ""TERF"" is supposed to stand for ""Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist,"" the people called ""TERF"" generally are neither radical feminists nor ""trans exclusionary,"" and in practice the term has become a slur. [More info.](https://redd.it/70cyzm)

1,GenderIsntCritical,"They can change their hair or what they wear, but no matter what they do, a man is still a man"
2,WikiMB,That explains how much violent the response for any skepticism regarding transgenderism is. And because of it I either hide or use my alt account to rise my voice on topics like these.
3,Tulcey-Lee,"I had an account locked yesterday on twitter. Unable to have a discussion with said person as they resorted to calling me a bitch and a terf and then the rape threats started. How is it now we live in a world where you can’t disagree anymore? Your opinion means you are fine to be harassed and threatened. 
I stated biology and that women don’t have a penis and there was no coherent argument just abuse."
4,Killy00013,Am I misreading this? It sounds like she doesn't belive both sides behave badly calling it a fallacy and also seems to support jk rowling by saying that those who send her death and rape threats arent women
5,maat89,And I opp....
6,Cha-Challenger,What did you do to cause this? Can you link the thread?
7,qsims,She doesn’t she’s pointing out how bullshit the claim is
8,Tulcey-Lee,"They said some
Women have penis’s and I said no they don’t."
9,Killy00013,"she forgot to put /s then, I hate when people are sarcastic online, I usually cant tell because nowdays you can say the most fcked up things and actually mean them"
10,qsims,But she’s not being sarcastic..?
11,Killy00013,"if she isnt sarcastic then she sounds like she is on jk's side, that's how i see it"
12,qsims,I’m sorry I don’t understand how?
13,2or3thingsIknow,They simply do not care. Because of all the social capital they have they are literally acting like terrorists and slamming women all over the place.
14,baconbitsy,"Honey, the amount of people who use “TERF” to stop a discussion is ridiculous.  “I’m not gonna debate you because you’re a TERF!” followed by a lot of nonsensical insults just proves what they really are: misogynists."
15,Vibrosphere,You're invalidating the women who menstruate by sticking tomato juice Popsicles in their recta and collecting the meltjuice with tampons and menstrual pads.
16,Simone_Auclert,If you're woman who acknowledges reality you're a terf.
17,,[removed]
18,Cha-Challenger,First off all they're not saying MtFs can have periods. They're saying FtMs can still have periods post transition.
19,mypretties,"They have a ton of time of their hands since 99% of society wants nothing to do with them.

TIMs: “I can be a normal man and go out and achieve a good life for myself or I can sit in my mom’s basement, shriek TERF at her if she questions me stealing my sister’s panties, eat cheetos, stick tomato juice up my ass and mod r/actuallesbians. Hmmm gonna have to go with choice #2!”"
20,stargazer612,Oh dear gawd is this a thing????
21,TheCatsEyeNebula,A few months and they'll use this as an arguement.
22,BellejarredDylan,But testosterone stops periods. So Ftm shouldn't be having them
23,Vibrosphere,"You know I want to go shake my finger at the youth and yell at them to GTFO my lawn but a lot of the most egregious TIMs are men older than myself (41)

Like, bro, you should know better."
24,ESyzygy,I’m ok with r/actuallesbians but only because I only pay attention to the cutesy romantic posts and not the trans/“girldick” ones
25,Vibrosphere,Well documented.
26,Idkjustgotquestions,Depends for some it takes a while for it to take effect and some aren’t on hormone replacement yet.
27,insomniac29,I know an FTM that sometimes gets periods for missing hormone doses. A lot of trans people don’t have regular access to treatment. They’re saving up for a hysterectomy. Or technically someone who hasn’t started treatment yet or for some reason doesn’t want medical treatment could identify as trans.
28,stargazer612,Just researched and will now scrub my browser history. Omg
29,BellejarredDylan,Im still going to only say women have periods
30,insomniac29,"Okay that’s fine, I’m just responding to your post saying that an FTM can’t have a period, they sometimes do."

32,,Had some male say they wanted to cannibalize my uterus for running radfem sapphic page before so this checks out
33,mypretties,Most TIMs are violent misogynists
34,YesPleaseMadam,"Online: I will perform female genital mutilation on you ugly TERF 

IRL: Has a menial remote job, orders everything he needs on the internet, hasn’t talked to a woman in 9 years other than his grandma that he calls on birthdays, never had sex, probably not even out as TIM yet mostly because he doesn’t have anyone to out* himself to

*edit: typo"
35,Skaddox,Who would have thought their mental illness also seeps into every other aspect of their life and personality??
36,yesisaiditxx,"Man, isn’t the internet a wild ride. You read something like this and think it’s a toss up between, “This man would maybe actually violently attack me and hurt me if we ever had a real life confrontation” *or* “One dose of my ability to speak my mind critically and bluntly in real life and I’d make this dude cry.”"
37,Think__Critically,But misgendering is *literal violence*. This is fine though.
38,BettysBitterButter,He can't help it.  He's so oppressed.  You wouldn't understand.
39,babylonsisters,"I cant wait for the day I can respond to shit like this with, ""Sounds like some internalized misogyny."" because it reminds them that they cant escape the fact that their behavior reflects a male pathology."
40,faultierin,"Well, thats not very ladylike"
41,,So violently jealous of our bodies he's murderous.
42,stegosaurid,Totally not an incel though...
43,Glamalez,"I’d like to see him try, I sleep with a gun😉"
44,IndustrialDinge,I wonder if he typed this up during his breaks at the help desk
45,willyounicelyfuckoff,This is a mental illness
46,griffxx,"But they are a woman, this can't be the case, cause if was that would make them a 
MAN/s..."
47,Blondejobs,Man wants to beat and disfigure women because they won’t “shut up ” sounds about right.
48,06549r,Isn’t that the stupid kid who then pulled the “I’m just a kid” when everyone was tearing him a new one for saying all that shit?
49,throwpatatasmyway,Yet they insist that TERFs (mostly lesbians who just won't suck that D) are the violent ones. Lmfao. What a bunch of wackos.
50,crikeyuhoh,"Ok, Ed Gein."
51,Randomosaur,"Is that even possible? If you put your hand far enough inside you'd be inside the uterus, unable to grab it or rip it out."
52,AKinglyAss,feel the progressiveness...
53,forvalentinesday2020,They always focus on the 'female' part of us. Like it's so obvious that they hate us for being women.
54,ArtGal94,"literally made me physically recoil.

58,NineSevenFive975,That’s a rather large brush you’re painting on a group of people?
59,BettysBitterButter,He only calls his grandma on *his* birthday.  Certainly not hers.
60,ReignRain95,"lol thats a cope, these could very well be people that look normal to everyone else irl."
61,daughter_of_bilitis,">“One dose of my ability to speak my mind critically and bluntly in real life and I’d make this dude cry.”

Not that hard, just use the correct pronouns for him 😂"
62,tamingthemind,"He's just expressing himself, jeeeeeez /s"
63,NineSevenFive975,Transgendered people are pretty oppressed now they can’t even serve in the US army boo.
64,throwpatatasmyway,Very Bufallo Bill like.
65,EffectiveProcess,Same.
66,NineSevenFive975,What being trans?
67,DimDroog,"Who?

I don't remember this."
68,YesPleaseMadam,hahaha. yeah that’s better.
69,AKinglyAss,"""I noticed that there was no cheque in my birthday card this year, grandma. I'm *sure* this was a mistake..."""
70,atomiic_vomiit,awwwww they can’t serve in the rape machine that is the us military? tragic. judging by this post the XYs would fit right it.

93,sarahkate2011,Karma whoring at its finest.
94,QueenRowana,"What we want if for men to stay out of womens spaces. Simple. Fighting for women is a good thing. If that means some men get their little girl panties (that they love wearing so much) in a twist. I ain’t upset. And if they want to use slurs and threaten us while doing it. Well thats hurtful but still inconsequential. Because that report button isn’t just decorative.  I’m standing up for women so men, yeah i dont care if you chop off your dick or wear a dress and makeup.  They’re never gonna be a woman. 
Have a lovely day!"
95,QueenRowana,"I love that this is still pissing men off almost a month later. Men who, by the way, are not and never will be women. Sorry you have no life. Big F (whatever that means)"
96,QueenRowana,I don’t think i understand what you mean?
97,QueenRowana,"Right so how much of that post did you read and how long have the Tims been whispering in your ear? 

Women’s spaces should be for women and women only. These weirdos in wigs and dresses are not and can never be women. No matter how badly they mutilate their genitals. I will not bow down to their behavior and i will not accept insults from “allies” like you.  You contribute to a system that demeans women and denies us our existence. A system that doesn’t even allow lesbian her sexuality anymore. A system where a male mediocre weightlifter can decide today that he is a woman and start winning gold medals in women’s classifications tomorrow. 

Terf is a foul slur usually accompanied by threats of beatings, rapes and murder to women who refuse to cater to men’s fragile ego’s and most notably their autogynephila and fetishes. 
I refuse to be called names by woke weirdos like you who think women should die when all we want is to make men get out of our faces, out of our sports and out of out bathrooms. We dont want them to die, we want them to act like a normal human being. Not a anime doll. But you just echo what they teach you. 

Next time you call someone trash please re-read this message and realize i could have just insulted you right back. But i didnt do that. Now try and see who is the one between us two capable of calm and rational thought and who has used cursewords as their only retort to a woman standing up for herself."
98,QueenRowana,"They’re men. The text says nothing about qualification. I wouldnt want to be treated by an unqualfied woman either. But i dint want to be cared for by a man perion.  These are men, not “trans women!?!!” And yes they are attempting to steal women only spaces. They are men. It’s their ultimate goal it seems."
99,QueenRowana,Correct i didn’t write it. But i had not seen it on this sub before and loved it. I agree with it completely. Men can get the hell out if womens spaces. They are not welcome. And diaper fetishists too by the way sir!
100,auklet,"Terf is used as a slur, by trans rights activists. You'll often hear it in phrases such as ""kill all terfs.""  I think many ""terfs"" agree that ""terf""  is an accurate term when used to mean ""woman who doesn't agree that a man can become a woman."" But trans activists use it to mean, ""Person who refuses to validate my claim to be a woman and therefore should be humiliated, ostracized, and murdered. """

106,kaladinner,"Gotcha, thanks. Are the majority of you also sex-worker exclusionary as well? If you remove delusions of infinite genders, and hedonistic pornographer women being glorified, then I can get behind feminism. I mean, I'm still gonna call obese, dyed haired women ""SJWs""; and I'm sure as hell not denying that men are biologically stronger than women, but other non-sexually-immoral ideologies you guys hold are fine by me."
107,QueenRowana,"I’m not against normal men who mind their own business at all. Men can be great. I’m only against trans people if they are men trying to get away with stuff and get into female spaces by wearing dresses and turning their penis inside out or even just claiming they are women while they arent even remotely trying, they are literally just men. I have little to no trouble with women who try to become men. They don’t bother me usually. I say good luck to them. They are still weird but I wish them luck fitting in with men. But men trying to be women. Yeah i have something against them and i will fight against them and for women.  

Every day. 

Again. Have a nice day."
108,QueenRowana,"I didnt write it. I do agree with it though. 

I never said YOU were a man. I just said ‘men’ but if you felt like i was talking about you go off i guess. 

And are you sure you’re a woman. Isn’t that enforcing a gender binary which could hurt trans peoples feelings? (Big sarcasm in case you didn’t get that)"
109,QueenRowana,"I am indeed not bothered at all by that. Because i care about women and preserving our spaces, not about the fragile ego’s of men who like to wear dresses and want to be called “ma’am”"
110,QueenRowana,That dont mean it’s untrue though. Men with a trans fetish are a danger to women. Whether i wrote it or not doesnt make it false.
111,auklet,"Radical feminists,  ftom what I read, see ""sex work"" including porn as exploitative."
112,girl_undone,"It's a misnomer to say feminists are ""excluding"" ""sex workers"" when we say that the men who rape and sell women in sexual slavery and prostitution are horrible and shouldn't be able to do that."

115,kaladinner,Can you elaborate?
116,QueenRowana,"Trans ‘women’ are men. The reason they don’t pass is because they are men. Not women. 

> . Men don’t try to get into female spaces by being trans. 

Lol. It’s 50% “grr i’m not allowed in womens [fill in here: bathroom, locker room, rape shelter, prison] Let’s put on a dress and waltz in, no one will dare stop me”. These are predators out to get weak women and many cases are documented of  so called “trans women” (men) getting permission to go to female prision instead of male and at the very least creeping the fuck out of vulnerable women and at worst rape and hurt them. Many cases about men freaking out for not being admitted to women rape shelters. Cases of men sendingvdeath threats to lesbians who refuse to fuck men with dicks. Of pedophiles who claim to be trans to get lowered sentences. Of men going Into womens bathrooms with ugly dresses and terrible fake wigs just for fun and to terrify women in a space where once they would have come to get away from men. 

And 50% “ i just want to have tits to play with and be submissive slut in bed”. Of which the last one i will admit are usually not quite as nefarious. But they’re definitely AGP."
117,QueenRowana,"Fetish? Lol i have literally 0 fetishes.  Your “tendencies” are a fetish. 
I care about women enough to not want men with dicks forcing themselves into lesbian spaces, into women rape shelters, into womens locker rooms, toilets and prisons.  If your main objective is forcing women to just lie down and take it while men like you walk all over them you are not a feminist."
118,,[removed]
119,QueenRowana,"Fascination with “lady dick”? I have never used that word except to express my disgust at the word. Maybe you mistook my disgusted frustration at men referring to penises as a “girldick” for fascination, HalfBreed?

Men like you saying stuff like ‘kill terfs’ are inciting violence against women yet somehow i’m the one who doesnt care about women? Thats cute dude! Such a male thing to do!
Hope you have a great day!"

121,QueenRowana,"Frustration at Lack of having a maledick. Lol. No thanks. Dick can be nice, but not on me, only in me. 

You dont have a ‘girldick’ if such a thing even exists. You just have a dick. You’re a man.. simple. 

Three legs??? Your dick being leg three then. Yes. Sounds accurate..."

50% of them are violent predators
The other 50 is just sexual fetishists.

This is not the sort of language that women use to attack each other. I wouldn't even use this sort of objectifying and grossly sexual language against my worst enemy.

When's the last time (before this post) you've heard a man say that women or some specific group of women had value only as holes to fuck? I'm going to guess recently. This is 100% the kind of language insecure men use to attack women."

Oh I'm so sorry that you were raped, but you still understand that *not all men* do that, right? You musnt forget to say that before and after you apologetically share what happened to you. 

Oh I'm sorry the rape crisis center was defunded by a man, but I hope you understand it's because those women were bigots for wanting to heal privately and with dignity. Their wants outweigh your needs, because as a woman, you are everything they wish they were. This is ""privledge"", not objectification. 

Oh I'm so so sorry to hear you didnt place in your sport after training your whole life because men now compete in womens sports. But the fact they get the limited scholarships and opportunities for women, should really be an inspiration for you to just work harder and be quietly supportive.

Oh I'm so so VERY sorry that abortions are punishable by a life sentence in certain states and getting harder and harder to access, but it seems so exclusionary since transwomen dont get to experience this, so we shouldn't focus on it. The most important thing is that everything is about transwomen all the time. If it's not, then it's about how it hurts them that it's not, and THAT is the important peice of every puzzle. 

Oh, you dont like the red robes they are rolling out...I'm so so so sorry about that. But it's because you are lucky enough to be born a woman. I wish I was a woman, red is definitely my color and the cap hides my male pattern baldness UwU"

214,bishhpls,"If something sums up these people's utter hatred and contempt for women, this is it. The fact they are demanding women who have been traumatised by men and their male bodies allow them into the one space that is meant to be totally free of those traumatic elements, simply to validate their 'true and honest womanhood' is nothing short of horrifying. If a literal rape crisis centre isn't safe, where is?

They want to allow men who have a sexual fetish regarding objectifying women into a slew of outdated sexist stereotypes into a place where women are healing from sexual trauma. Where they will most likely exude exhibitionism and sexually harass these vulnerable women. All for sexual gratification and their own validation. TIMs claim to need these centres, and some may, but I believe the number of them that truly need shelter may be quite low and the rest are just creepy boundary pushing AGPs. Yet when they are offered separate accommodations away from the women, that just isn't good enough, they must be treated as exactly the same as a biological woman, even though they are NOT the same and belong to the group who victimised the women in the first place. That tells you all you need to know. They do not care about the actual shelter, they just care they're not included and not being constantly validated. So selfish."

359,Lady_Montgomery,"Odd how you can't say you wish for mentally ill people to get the help they deserve and need, instead of being destroyed by so-called doctors for a profit. Yet demanding that women get raped to death and or tortured to death is perfectly healthy and normal and should be allowed in the name of free speech. It's also perfectly normal that ""women"" want other women to get raped to death. We say that all the time, so normal and perfectly healthy, so ultra feminine.

398,Lady_Montgomery,Well keep a look out on r/thisneverhappens  when something happens it will be posted there. Its not a matter of if. Thinking you are of the opposite sex is a symptom of at least metal instability (imo a symptom of mental illness) and mental instability can (not necessarily) lead to deadly situations. So it just a waiting game for now.
399,Lady_Montgomery,"When you think you are the opposite sex you are most definitely mentally ill. Its like saying you are born in the wrong body and that you are an alien from galaxy 1000 miles away. It's not real. It's a mask for something else. A personality disorder, childhood trauma, even trauma in later life, autism, internalized homophobia, internalized misogyny, plain old misogyny (when it comes to men claiming to be women) etc. It's a symptom. Not an actual thing. But it's also a multi billion business that preys on the unstable. As long as there are people that can make a shit load of money on the mentally disturbed they will. Providing actual help doesn't make people as much money. And as long as people sign a contract that says informed consent, they can actually get away with it. It's vile and grotesque.

Every single person that claims to be of the opposite gender is at least highly mentally unstable and often times mentally ill."

408,Eowyn19,Exactly what I was thinking. It’s already happened. Hardly any libfems even know about trans criminals because discussing them is “literally violence”.
409,0WatcherintheWater0,"You seem to not understand modern gender theory. What makes someone a certain gender is a combination of three things. 1) identity (what gender you see yourself as), 2) body (what physical characteristics society prescribes to different genders), and 3) presentation (what behaviors are prescribed to certain genders, an example would be gender roles). You’ll notice that chromosomes have nothing to do with it. So long as Trans people fit two out of those three things, they **are** the opposite gender, your opinion on the subject is irrelevant.  They aren’t mentally ill. Gender dysphoria still is a mental illness, of course, but for separate reasons, and a lot of trans people aren’t dysphoric.

Also, it’s not a mask, sure there are trans people who change in order to cover up past trauma, but the vast majority are sincere in their beliefs. 

May I ask, what do you think would actually help trans people beyond surgery? Therapy wouldn’t do anything beyond maybe making them more suicidal, that’s for sure."
410,FTThrowAway123,"Report to the [FBI](https://tips.fbi.gov/). You can submit a tip online. I've submitted tips twice before. Both times an agent called me back promptly and seemed to take it seriously.  

Also, the [U.S. Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/how-do-i/report-suspicious-activity) has suggestions.  

>""If You See Something, Say Something®"" is a national campaign that raises public awareness of the indicators of terrorism and terrorism-related crime, as well as the importance of reporting suspicious activity to state and local law enforcement.  

I'll be reporting to both. This is above Reddits paygrade, nor do I trust them to actually do anything about it."
411,2or3thingsIknow,"Yep, he's a real psycho that one."
412,Lady_Montgomery,"I heard all that bs before and it's a cry for attention. There males and females. Gender roles are bs. Chromosomes determine your sex, which equals your gender. The end. Basic biology. So called trans people need psychological help to determine what is truly the matter with them: a personality disorder, autism, trauma (sexual or other wise), internalized homophobia/misogyny. The only reason it isn't qualified as a mental disorder officially is because it has become a multi billion industry. The profits made to mutilate so called transgenders are so incredibly high. So of course they want the medical world to say its okay and normal. Trans people do not exist. It's as simple as that. A d you know it too else you wouldn't be commenting here. You are looking for validation from people who are telling you the truth. If you can convince us, you can convince yourself. I wish you the best. And I hope you find proper help to help you with either you personality disorder or your past trauma you haven't dealt with yet. Good luck.

BTW if you aren't dysphoric, no need to mutilate your body either and pump it full with hormones your body isnt meant to produce. You know doing that when you aren't dysphoric doesn't make sense."

Until the day you die and forever afterward you'll be a woman with short hair, an intentional chemical imbalance and depending on your personal decisions extensive plastic surgery and body modifications. You're not a man. You can scream it as loudly as you like, but it won't make reality any different. You don't want to be a woman, I get that. I can't blame you. The world can be kinda shitty for us. However, you can't just opt-out of reality. I can say I’m a walrus --but if I show up on a beach none of the other walruses are going to be particularly impressed me and zero percent of them will buy it. As for the rest of what I wrote, the concept remains the same so I don't see a point in editing it. 

( Correction: in order to not feed into delusional thinking I did indeed edit pronouns in my previous comment in order to reflect reality.) 

You understood it clearly enough. You don't have to be a girly girl, you can have short hair, you can have your breasts removed--you can take hormones if you want because its your body and you can do what you want with it --but how you express your personal aesthetics has exactly zero impact on biological fact.  You're still a woman and the rest of the world has no obligation to play along with your fantasy. You need to accept who you actually are, a non conformist  woman, instead of making up a whole new person to distance yourself from the things you dislike about the world and your body."

By the way, since you’re here...” It’s pathetic how common it is to see - I’m curious if it really works, tbh, or if the cold hard reality of TRAs being too self-absorbed to help means the “burden” falls on ww trying to buy their way into being woke, and, by then, maybe a handful actually follow through."

I’ve said I actually SEE your point and agree with you. Once again, I was playing devil’s advocate on OP’s part. I never said it SHOULD be allowed, I’m just using Socratic questioning to *ask* if it’s okay once in a while. That doesn’t mean I think it should be posted. 

I’m not supporting this kind of post. Calm down."
555,moonflower,"You said you were ''sticking up for'' OP which implies that OP is under some kind of attack and needs to be defended.

You say you were ''asking'' if it should be allowed, but why would you even ask, if you didn't think it should be allowed? The very question suggests that you are defending that it should be allowed, as if I have said it shouldn't be, which I didn't.

560,tr330fsn4rk,"That sub is a joke. I’d never even visited the page and they banned me 🙄 Pretty sure that’s against Reddit rules, but whatever."
561,yesisaiditxx,"That’s why I made another reddit account to post in radfem communities because I knew I couldn’t comment on even a funny meme elsewhere without getting banned and attacked. 

Turns out, I enjoy this corner of reddit more than all the other increasingly ridiculous subs and now am hardly ever on my “actual” account. So, this is my actual account :) I’d take participating in these spaces over the rest if that’s how it has to be. 

I don’t mean any disrespect to her (the mod) but someone who obviously thinks sex work is a fine way to make money and continuously responds with condescension when someone confesses details of her rape? Dear, her ability to think outside the rules of the TRA cult is barely there, if at all. So many people on reddit get a thrill out of witch (pun heh) hunting “terfs”. You’d think maybe we could see this is the internet and allow for people to still post in your subs as long as what they post was appropriate...but we have long left the shores of reason.

Even with all of that, this is a shocking level of gaslighty scuminess. Even if someone believes ""trans women are women"", they are still in the same ""AMAB"" category as ""cis men"". But of course a traumatic response towards ""AMAB"" people isn't valid by their standards. In what universe is telling someone who isn't hurting anyone to ""manage your trauma like everyone else"" appropriate? There's something really insidious about this that I can't quite put my finger on, it's as if the mod feels entitled to your emotional state, as if the insides of your brain are obligated to be free of any thoughtcrimes against TIMs. This framing of trauma as something ""problematic"" that you basically need to get over for the benefit of others is absolutely vile."

It blows my mind how proclaimed feminists can somehow do the mental gymnastics required to rationalise elevating men who wish they were female above actual females. It's exactly like Orwell's 1984. The truth is lies, and lies are truth. Once enough people start proclaiming 2 plus 2 is five, others will follow. The social acceptance is too important to them. We are being socially engineered to believe bizarre and illogical concepts. 

These women who don't give a fuck they're walking back women's rights 120 years and who deride, mock and exclude women concerned for the status of our sex are absolute traitors."

I am so concerned about the ongoing suppression of any thoughts that deviate from the party line.

Why is it ok to call people terfs? Is their “movement” a house of cards that they fear any information or perspective that differs, will collapse the trans lobby?

What other group of people are threatened and silenced in our society now? 

Why is it allowed?"

Well, sorry for having been raped and abused and not healing fast enough from it, your majesty. Like wtf?!?"
596,Detroitaa,"They banned me, after I made my first comment. It had nothing to do with trans, or gender issues. I complemented someone for getting a new job. I was subsequently banned.

604,politipoop,"My abusers continually loved to minimise my issues, while expecting me to elevate theirs to astronomical levels. I did get a very bad (dangerous) vibe from the way the mod was writing.

Especially from their last comment telling me to “try not to be so foul”.

605,politipoop,It really felt like that. I’ve only ever had men talk to me like that.
606,politipoop,"If that is so, then it all makes a bit more sense."
607,politipoop,It seems like they’re not feminists at all. Was an eye opener for me.
608,politipoop,"Exactly! These people want me to stay home and quiet while they take over our hard fought for spaces? Fuck all of that!

At the moment a transwoman is trying to say that I’m sexist and rely on stereotypes. I’m a woman. I don’t need to rely on stereotypes to be a woman, a just am a woman! The cheek of some of these people.

(I must say that this is the only trans person that I’ve ever met or spoken to that believe that he is now a female, and really hates women, with a passion it seems. I assume because he can never be one. He’s not converting anyone to his cause of opening up all women’s spaces to men.)"
609,politipoop,"Thought it was just a bit of harmless memes, not that it was run by this type of victim blaming person."

613,politipoop,"Yeah, there’s a definite creepy male vibe around it. I wish I knew which mod it was."

617,politipoop,"Pretty sure the mod is a man. Hard to take their claim of sexual assault seriously after dismissing mine so easily. Seemed more like they wanted to get into a dick swinging contest about “who’s more fucked up/managed to get over it”.

Also, thou would have won anyway, as I don’t have a dick"
618,politipoop,Right? Like what the actual fuck? And all I did was dare to say that lesbians are only interested in women :D
619,politipoop,"Judging by everyone else here, you probably will be :D"
620,politipoop,Not sure really. I didn’t realise that lesbians were a touchy subject for anyone except incels.
621,burntmatchesburn3x,"""Get over it"" is the mantra of the abusive asshole."
622,politipoop,"Fuck, I’m sorry. It really doesn’t help that men are now allowed to roam around freely in them, and be applauded for doing it. It is still extremely difficult for me to use a public bathroom without having flashbacks/panic attacks. I hope you’re doing ok."
623,politipoop,"I’m glad I know now, and I’m glad others know about it too. The way that mod tried to bully me is exactly what another transwoman is also trying to do to me :D Exactly the same points: “your ptsd is nothing”, “my feelings are more important than women’s safety”, “get over it”.

So scary how they seem to have the same points when it comes to hating women and trying to keep us quiet, good little slaves.

If they actually want to be women, why do they hate us so much?"
624,politipoop,Oooh!

630,politipoop,"What? Wasn’t that post massively popular?

This is what we have to endure now. This is the next big stand we have to take as women. When people try to silence you and threaten you instead of talking, then we know how dictatorial they are.

Years ago though, that used to be actual homophobic, super religious people on Twitter who have serious problems with gay and GNC people in the first place.

They substituted Lilith with a male-born subservient Eve. They replace Myrine, also known as Marian, a moon/sea-goddess, known as mother of all gods, with a virgin subservient, completely null Mary, the virgin mother of god who is merely a vessel in an all-male creation myth. They subverted the symbolism of the cauldron to the chalice containing the blood of Christ (could it be more necrophiliac and cannibalistic than that?). I could go on and on. All they did with female-centric mythology was subvert all life-giving, life-creating symbols to all-male ""creators"" who worship death and destruction."
647,jupiterssunday,"Unfortunately for lesbians, being attracted only to women is now the height of bigotry.  If you’re not into penises you’d better either unlearn your fetish and have sex with penises or cop a beating terf (and then have sex with penises)

Yay progress."
648,knight_siegmeyer,"Completely understand. It's one of the more frustrating aspects of this dumb bathroom debate. Mostly because I feel people with so called good intentions don't wanna admit that people do bad things. Well, correction, men do bad things to women and little girls and it's somehow outside the realm of their understanding that YES men would certainly lie to take advantage of a situation to gain access to someone vulnerable. And funnily enough, men agree on some level that men can't be trusted. 

The arguement 'oh well, if they want to assault women a law against not being in the bathroom won't stop them' which, true it won't. But by that same logic we just shouldn't have gun control cuz 'people are gonna get guns illegally if they want them'. But a law is the law and having a societal barrier that says 'men should not be in women's bathrooms' is more of a deterrent than just breaking it down and saying 'yep! Men welcomed! Go on in boys!'    

I hope you're doing well, too. That sub can kick rocks."
649,06549r,"Not forever. They are losing the sympathetic ignorance that gave them so much power. Every single time there’s a “controversy” and they reply with their nonsense more people are waking up.

651,artificialgraymatter,That person is a troll who just hates anything connected to women.
652,bishhpls,"This is all about free speech rights. They've been chipped away at slowly but surely for years now. But the whole societal idea that it's okay to suppress and silence speech you disagree with but totally not okay to do the same to anybody you agree with is becoming more and more acceptable. If you don't support free speech for those you disagree with, you do not support free speech at all. That cornerstone of free speech is totally eroded. Those gullible people are being taken advantage of and encouraged and propagandized to in order to pass through laws and societal norm changes. We are not free any longer.

*I may not agree with what you say - but I will defend to the death your  right to say it*"
653,denverkris,"> Especially as an American, I’m worried that they are unknowingly chipping away at our free speech rights. 

Oh, they are definitely doing that. This is part of what's driving me away from the left. There are certainly a lot of nuts on the right, and they might say they don't like what you have to say, but you don't see a whole lot of them trying to outlaw your ability to say it."

658,politipoop,Such irony!
659,bishhpls,"They developed it for Trump supporters iirc. They just consider anything or anyone  who disagrees with them to be spouting hate speech. Most, in fact 99%, Trump supporters are not racists or genocidal. Whereas these fuckers want to rape and exterminate us for disagreeing. There are evil members of every political group that exists."

Now I know what a load of bs that was."
679,bishhpls,"Okay and you could say that for a lot of subs though. 
It's not okay to persecute people and do the equivalent of a yellow star on the chest for following a sub."
680,politipoop,"How did we get to this point? Where lesbians are being told that they’re transphobic and bigoted for not wanting to sleep with males. It’s just wrong, and actually rape if those poor women are successfully coerced.

It’s nightmarish."
681,ESyzygy,"I only just realized. If you look thru my comment history I used to stand up for trans people saying straight people are teed but then I finally realized that I was really stupid.

Some trans people don’t do that, but a lot do."

683,politipoop,Oh shit.
684,politipoop,"It is scary. It’s so weird how people with mental health problems have blackmailed us into pretending we also have those delusions. I have nothing against people with mental health problems, I’ve got plenty myself, but I don’t tell everyone else to change laws just to make me happy."
685,griffxx,All those Subreddits have members who are also members of T_D. These same members were on r/worldnews today hoping that nCoronavirus would wipeout a good portion of the Chinese population.
686,griffxx,"Because the TQ+++ coopted the LGB. This was all done with the lie of Stonewall and 2 generations of LGBTQ students indoctrinated on College and University campuses with Queer Theory and Gender Studies classes. The 2nd generation also was indoctrinated on Tumblr.

The problem with both generations is they either don't want to study LGB History or the History they are reading has been adulterated with a Transwashed Narrative."
687,griffxx,"We were talking about being masstagged. The MODs have special tools were they can see the tags, so they don't have to go through the post histories. But Trans people who aren't MOD probably still look at the comment section."
688,bishhpls,Doesn't mean all of the people there support that and deserve to be tarred with the same brush due to the actions of a minority.
689,politipoop,"I heard that you can’t just take something like lgb history, it’s now lgbtq history or something. Like a lot of the courses are changing specifically to include this stuff."
690,ESyzygy,Oh I meant that I used to support tans before I got called a TERF for talking about pregnancy.
691,griffxx,"This is a Sub for women, whose only transgressions is that they recognize the threat to their Civil Rights Movement and the strides that have been made, by Trans Identity politics. 

We don't need you here to try to state a case of T_D and not all Sub members. The corruption, graft, misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia anti-Semitism, racism and the shredding of Constitutional laws of the Trump Administration will be taught in  Political Science, Economics and History departments for decades to come."
692,griffxx,Yes they are.
693,griffxx,"I'm just letting you know, that if you have tools now. You might already be tagged."
694,bishhpls,"Were you paying any attention to the previous Obama administrations violations by any chance?

And I am well aware of what this sub is for, btw. I'm GC and a woman, and I contribute regularly to GC subs. And I'm not a trump supporter here to defend him, I'm simply a realist and equal opportunity political party and candidate skeptic, democrat or republican I don't trust you.

 I don't like *any* politicians. But Obama was just as bad, esp on grace violations of law and process, as well as war crimes, he was just the liberal media's golden boy and it wasn't publicised. Even though the economy was a mess. I think it's disingenuous to think Trump is the only problem and that all his supporters are pitch fork wielding racists when the same problems existed long before trump."
695,politipoop,It’s so insidious.

699,,[deleted]
700,protozoanpussy,"I really wish someone had this conversation with me when I was 12. I spent my young teenage years exposing myself to older men online and feeling so cool for it. I’m currently in an extremely toxic relationship with a man 30 years my senior. The damage I’ve caused myself is probably irreparable. I don’t feel empowered, I feel used and silly."
701,fogellegof,Lol implicitly this means that TiMs are predators.
702,,I wish I’d had older and wiser women to help me to navigate the dating world when I was young and dumb(er). I’d have avoided several toxic relationships and probably wouldn’t have been sexually assaulted.
703,MadSeaPhoenix,Kind of glad as it’s making the word lose its efficacy.
704,moonflower,"I think perhaps the accusation of being 'terfs' wasn't based on that comment, but on previous comments not shown here - this looks like a grudge carried over from another conversation"

713,LesbianPrincess-,They are
714,,"tbh i've finally had this coalesce in my mind and i've been trying to bring it up at every opportunity. the \*mere engagement in trans identification\* is abusive because it is \*gaslighting\*. I have not seen \*one\* man in a dress who doesn't engage in the abusive factors of 1) denying reality (with the expectation that those he demands deny it as well) and 2) threatening violence (on himself or others) when or even just at the possibility that people don't comply with his demands of reality denial. (Threats to 't\*rfs' or 'transphobes' and threats to himself through threatening suicide or implying that not denying reality will force others to kill themselves.) 

&#x200B;

i now believe (and have seen no evidence otherwise) that these men who ""identify as women"" are unilaterally abusers, because at the bare minimum their gaslighting is abusive. with abuse comes predatory behavior, and thank you for saying this because i had not thought about that aspect of it too. the more time i spend here and on sister subs and read news articles (like the [recent win by a young man with pink hair to have unrestricted access to all the masturbatory aid he needed in the form of real live uncensored vulnerable teenage women](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/11/14/palatine-schaumburg-high-school-district-votes-to-give-transgeder-students-unrestricted-locker-room-access/)) the more i am convinced that every single one is a narcissistic abusive predator."
715,LesbianPrincess-,"I know that feeling and can SO relate, but please don’t blame yourself. On the plus side, at least we can warn other women now :) Especially younger ones. Let’s use that wisdom to protect other women <3 Even though it came at a shitty cost."
716,LesbianPrincess-,"So? I see this wayyyyyyy too much on tumblr. It’s ridiculous. People will call women “terfs” all the time in an attempt to disprove our points. It’s still just as bad. 

But honestly I have seen people calling this stuff terfy, especially when we talk about patriarchy. Because calling out patriarchy and men’s oppression of women is offensive to TIMs."

725,protozoanpussy,"Thank you. It’s hard for me to believe that I was exploited because I feel like I consented and willingly participated in everything that happened to me. Now that I’m slightly older, I am starting to think I was groomed. It’s hard to remember how it all started though because I was “dating” a 30 year old online before I even had my first period. I think I’ve blocked a lot of it out.

727,2or3thingsIknow,This. They 100% are. They like being abusive males.
728,,Thank you <3 You’re right
729,SometimesJacka,"So true. 

In addition because there are less boundaries between the communities they get really paranoid and start flagging any sort of woman centered content as ‘terf-y’. Too much of social faux pas for them to be caught anywhere near ‘terf’ content or people. 

It’s funny when the opposite happens — rad fems reblogging TRA or QT content. The notes on those posts are just hilarious. Rad fems acknowledge good posts regardless of the poster, so not only do TRAs / QT have to be careful about who they follow and what they reblog, they have to make sure their content doesn’t appeal to radical feminists either. 


But yes the witch hunts for ‘terfs’ on tumblr is a real thing."
730,2or3thingsIknow,This guy thinks trans males can gestate babies. Just an FYI. Seems to dislike actual feminists.
731,moonflower,Because your title implied that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc - but I think the person who called them 'terfs' was very likely referring back to a previous discussion

Explains the fragile ego, the need to “correct” women, the incessant arguing, refusal to admit that he’s wrong and doesn’t know what he’s talking about, etc."
738,olatundew,"At best, this makes the accusation of TERF foolish and strategically misguided. We don't know if there was prior context, but we *do* know that they chose to spin off the wording used in the previous comment."
739,LesbianPrincess-,Nah. Lol
740,,The commenter in the linked page. It was a post about girls being taken advantage of. You’d have to be a special kind of asshole to derail that to point out a “terf”
741,LesbianPrincess-,You commented on my post. 😹😹 Thank you! That’s a compliment.
742,2or3thingsIknow,Looks that way. Posts on GenderCriticalGuys (gets almost no upvotes).
743,moonflower,"Yes, but that's another issue. Are you disagreeing with anything I said?"
744,moonflower,"You said: ""Mentioning anything about patriarchy, exploitation and trauma are ‘terfy’ now"" ... how is that *not* implying that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc?

You're denying what's right in front of you and laughing about it."
745,moonflower,"Oh yes, of course it was inappropriate, but the point I was making was that the accusation of 'terf' probably wasn't based on those comments - and we already know that people who use 'terf' as a derogatory term wouldn't be interested in discussing anything about how to protect female people, so they probably didn't even think about the current discussion, only concerned about silencing 'terfs'"

747,LesbianPrincess-,"Gee, I wonder why! What a loser lol. He should be banned from this subreddit. I reported the rude comments but maybe mods haven’t gotten to them yet 🤷‍♀️"
748,olatundew,"Well, if we're splitting hairs, I disagree that it's ""very likely"" that this was in response to a previous comment.

More to the point, I do think that this part of the same issue - how do we have constructive conversations about complicated gender issues?"
749,LesbianPrincess-,"What exactly am I denying? I’m just disagreeing with you. 

Honestly, you’ve been very rude to me in the past and I would like to be done with this convo. I actually know how tumblr works and this stuff is all too common. Plus there are too many users on there for there to be people who remember users’ “prior terfy conversations” or whatever. Men call us terfs for being feminists. Period. 

Bye.

Edit: Apparently the person I'm talking to is a MALE! What a surprise. Dominating the conversation and telling women that we don't know what we're talking about. He should be banned. Mansplaining at its finest, and he has the audacity to call himself a feminist. Wow."
750,,"Exactly, so that person is a trash gremlin regardless of what they were referencing. So it doesn't really matter."
751,LesbianPrincess-,"😹😹😹 We get it, you’re insecure and projecting because of your small penis. Bye."
752,moonflower,"Do you really think it is at all likely that this person called them 'terfs' based solely on those comments, with no previous history between them?"
753,moonflower,"You are denying that your title implies that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc.

Also, how ironic that you complain of people who judge current comments based on prior conversations, at the same time as you are doing that exact same thing to me - you are the one who is being rude here, and rude in the past - way ruder than I have ever been to you.

I disagree with things that you say, and call you out on your bad behaviour, and you interpret that as ''rudeness'' and use it as an excuse to be even more rude to me."
754,moonflower,I think it does matter if OP is misrepresenting the situation
755,2or3thingsIknow,"Yes, because that is what these clownfish do. They label anything and everything terf because they cannot answer. Stop pretending you haven't seen this."
756,olatundew,"That's a slightly different claim from the original one, but yes - I've seen TERF used in some pretty atrocious ways (e.g. ""I'm going to rape you, you fucking TERF"") so I wouldn't rule it out. Plus, this particular comment they were responding to was purposeful and well-written, and seemed to be the beginning of a new conversation - so it seems a non-sequiter for it to have been part of an ongoing (quite bitter) dialogue."
757,LesbianPrincess-,"I’m not denying it. My “Nah. Lol” was just dismissing what you were saying. 

I’m just saying I don’t have time to argue with you when you’ve been rude in the past. Move along. Blocking you because I don’t have time for this weird drama. Lol. And not sure what “bad behavior” you’re referencing. Pretty weird."
758,,There's no actual evidence that the situation is being misrepresented though???
759,moonflower,Actually I have never seen anyone called a 'terf' unless they have said something which suggests that they believe that male people cannot become female
760,moonflower,I don't really understand your reasoning at all - I came to the opposite conclusion based on exactly the same perception that it was a new conversation and *therefore* inappropriate to be calling anyone 'terfs' in response to the subject matter - much more likely that the person calling them 'terfs' was referring to a different conversation
761,moonflower,"OK, we'll see if you really do block me - perhaps that means I will be free to speak my views in future without you being rude and denying reality all over my comments eh"
762,moonflower,"Not on the linked page, no, but I think it's very likely that the accusation of 'terf' was in reference to a previous encounter and not based on the shown comments"
763,2or3thingsIknow,Male people are male people. Not female. Males. Stop fucking colonizing us you sick bastards. I'm done playing nice with you creeps.
764,olatundew,"That's because we're talking about two different scenarios. I'm saying this doesn't look like an out-of-context snippet of conversation, you're saying it does look like there is a background context to their relationship. Both could be true, or neither."
765,,[deleted]
766,zombieeezzz,Holy shit. Shut up. You keep repeating this point and no one cares.
767,,You think it’s very likely. Which means you have no actual evidence and all of the drama you’re causing about this is based on nothing but a hunch that nobody even cares about.

782,crikeyuhoh,No its not surprising because men sexually assault women pretty regularly and talking about it does not equal bigotry. Lol how feminist and woke to use sexual assault against the victims as if it makes them unreliable narrators of their own experience. Seems mighty fucking familiar to me.

815,sojourner_truth_,Are they? Because I was called that and instantly banned from a sub just a few days ago. At this point it feels like most subs are moderated by trans rights activists who will immediately ban anyone who has ever disagreed with their agenda.

Bonus points for the dude that said being a woman and being biologically female are different things. They need the validation and buy-in of society to be “valid” where no matter what we just are.

820,winewatcher,"I’ve been permanently banned from several subs and I’ve only been here for a couple of months. The other day I posted a commented empathizing with a woman female or trans I don’t know) who said she had been sexually assaulted and wanted to know if others thought she should report the friend who attacked her. Others said to report her rapist. I was empathic and also said that if she didn’t report him he would go on to rape other women. I finished with something like “Think of your sisters”. 

Some trans person must have looked at my profile or recognized my Reddit name and screamed at me online about having no right to comment, I was a pretend feminist, etc. 

Unfuckingbelievable!  Nothing I said was particularly feminist. It was just one woman empathasizing with the suffering of another woman at the hands of a man who attacked her. One human being reaching out to comfort another. 

The person who reacted so badly to not being centered in that moment was a man larping as a woman and doing it badly because he failed Female Bonding 101. 

He’s a man because his rage at me was so disproportionate to my comment and to the tone of the comment (empathy and sisterly advice which the woman asked for). 

He’s a man because he immediately jumped to who owns feminism when that wasn’t the topic. 

He’s a man because if it isn’t about him he can’t be quiet or move along. 

He’s a man because maybe the topic of sexual assault, rape, and friends who are attackers hit to close to home so he had to derail the thread."

TRAs say I'm not a ""real feminist"" because I don't include ""all women"" (aka trans women). It feels exactly like mansplaining. They are basically misgendering themselves."

Men such as these should be receiving a verbal smackdown to remind them of their place before Our foremothers roll out of their graves in contempt for whatever this is going on because this male is not a feminist. 
Also:They call us trans exclusionary but fail to realize we aren’t excluding trans men (AFABs), we exclude males and  the LadyDique owners  because males have no place in feminism outside of  standing in solidarity with us and being allys.

That's how they can twist this crappy theory to say GC are white supremacist because queer theorists queer the system so anyone who stops that is supporting the system. This is why it's pointless people arguing that GC can't be white supremacists because we're diverse and anti racist because it's all actually logical through critical race theory. It's these evidence free, bullying activist theories and their proponents which need to be argued against."

GD is a minor brain abnormality that changes the self identity and anxiety while most of the brain is like usual for the natal sex. Thus it's not surprising that it's the MTF population that are causing most of the problems while we hardly hear anything from the FTM population despite the fast growth caused by the ROGD epidemic. 

The paraphilic/AGP subpopulation of male GD is likely the most common offender because of their abnormal sexual drive. We've seen this with JY and other famous cases where multiple paraphilias overlap within the same individual. It's sad to see it has become taboo to talk about abnormal sexualities. Sexuality is by no means an area devoid of pathological behaviours. On the contrary, the intense sexual urge (especially for men) can cause a wide range of pathological/perverse/paraphilic behaviours.

I think another large chunk are people who ""don’t understand it"" and think that because it doesn’t make sense to them it must be intellectually above their heads and therefore super smart and enlightened and deferring to the loudest people is correct and deferring to the ""marginalized"" is woke and a harmless (to them) and easy way to ""be a good person"".

\*\*in here before some TRA tries to use handpicked, debunked claims of ""uhhhhhh ahcktually trans people won all the gay rights for you you're welcome uwu"" because if trans people actually DID achieve all those civil rights victories, then they should have had no problem fighting for their **own** acceptance without needing to hide behind the LGB shield and pretend same-sex love is AT ALL similar to dress-up"

Is man a slur? Are they just trying to replace women? 
Besides, nobody who says that commits violence against trans people. Violence is mainly from men who have problems with dating trans, not women.


 But no, wanting to fix the women shelters is ""literally causing trans to commit suicide"" if you kill yourself that's still not the fault of poor women who need help raising children instead of being abused."

TIL that the only way to ""escape"" a verbal altercation is to immediately escalate it to physical assault.

TIL that the imagined potential for danger is indistinguishable from tangible, imminent danger.

TIL that men are so weak and defenseless against a woman's *words* that responding in kind just won't do.



🙄

I can only hope that this is a wet dream or a starter attempt at erotica, and not anything remotely approximating a recounting of actual events.

Either way, I'm thinking more about carrying now that ""pUnCh A tErF"" has become a thing than I ever did before in my 30 some-odd years.

So at some point they have to catch on, and think it’s just not worth it. I mean even if this generation doesn’t, the younger generations have to be watching and learning. Once they notice that they (transbians) are just seen as perverts and have zero respect or credibility perhaps they won’t want to be seen that way as well. It’s like carrying a sign saying I’m a lesbian fetishist. I lurk on MTF sometimes, and I’ve seen quite a few posts lately (over the last 4 months?) from them. The posts are basically about being depressed over being seen as fetishist, or asking how they’ll know if it’s just a fetish, because they don’t want to be a fetishist. Don’t you think that will grow? Is it just my wishful thinking?"

They might get discredited in as much as white guys driving white vans with no sign on them got discredited over time, but they won’t stop shaming and gaslighting women (even if they only get to do it to their mothers and possible wives). 

Mental illness when untreated only tends to become harder. Fetishes and kinks only tend to get more specific and weirder. Without proper care, by which i mean no pumping hormones and no social validation, but long hours in session to figure out how to change bad behavior and whatever therapy doctors might find that can help in the future (once they start doing their jobs of CARING for patients anyway) might help. 

I have no hope for men to just snap out of it. Don’t think you should either."

Trans women are women and female. If this is false, it becomes an existential Crisis."

All of this biological incoherence has been based on the ""inside baseball"" of geneticist.

Constantly in conversation, forcing their genitals into your mind like they want to do to your pants. Gender roles should not dictate a damn thing to anyone. They have nothing to do with anything except their own personal LARP and sexism. That is their business.  Many people in the community are GNC, and that used to be celebrated (at, you know...PRIDE). Now women need to know their place again. To be quiet and let the trans women dictate when autonomy is appropriate, or else."
1296,Randomosaur,How are lesbians a danger to trans people? It's the other way around.
1297,yesisaiditxx,Penis exclusionary lesbians would have been an oxymoron until recently. It makes me laugh just reading it. These people promote free sexuality and “boundaries” so much but you aren’t allowed to say that there’s a group of females out there who don’t want to be penetrated by a penis. Insane. No one is bugging gay men or “straight” trans women for not wanting to have sex with a “vagina haver”.

The TRA constantly try to wrap themselves in the cloak of other social movements that fought for justice. For example, glomming on to the success of the gay and lesbian rights movements.

Folk is used in Doric all the time and is a gender neutral term akin to “y’all”, and I’ve had to fight folk with “please stop telling me I can’t use one of my languages just to appease random internet strangers.”

Even your everyday users of makeup/skin/fashion/nail polish subs have complained because being male/trans/non-binary guarantees ridiculous amounts of upvotes over ""regular"" content posted by ""regular"" users. It winds up burying posts looking for legitimate feedback under those who just want to be people to drool over them for having the *audacity* to post. Honestly, I'm surprised this particular kind of post isn't more prevalent in sub like that...but maybe posting this sort of thing in a literal circlejerk subreddit is being just a little *too* transparent about their intentions.

Makeup is patriarchal bullshit, anyway."

This is honestly so disheartening. Why do all these makeup subs think you're some kind of evil nazi just because you don't agree with TRAs on everything?"
1364,samanthahazard,"Telling women to shut up... how original. It’s not like men have been saying this very same thing about outspoken women for *literally all of human history* or anything. 

It’s amazing. We make up more than half the population, we are able to carry life inside of us and bring it in to the world, we raise the children that become the leaders of tomorrow... yet blatant fucking misogyny and silencing women like this is still supported and propagated in 2020, **BY WOMEN** as well as men. It just goes to show how far some women have internalized the hate men show us. It’s a sick sad world."
1365,cursorylight,"I've noticed these sorts of posts showing up in completely different and unrelated subs and they all go about it the same way.

Someone can go on a whole rant about TERFs or share their entire trans life story and as long as they make sure to add a tiny element of the sub they're posting in, the mods can turn a blind eye because they're not technically breaking the ""must be related to the sub"" and ""no politics"" rules."

1407,rezkidsinlove,"""We respect your artistic intent""

Like, bruh, I used to regular that sub and most of the time it was the same cat eye and red lip being posted every day and every hour. I mean, hey, if that's your look, cool, but it's far from artistic...

But is this in response to tension created in that sub because of NikkiTutorials?

How sad they're stanning rapist men 😔"
1408,ciaokhan,"I just got banned and muted from there for replying to somebody who asked what terfs were..the mod of course gave the whole ""blah blah blah harmful and violent transphobia""

I got banned for;

""Terfs are women and lesbians who don't necessarily agree with all the trans rhetoric. It's a derogatory term meant to silence and witchhunt. I recommend you check out both sides and make your own opinion about it""

Literally proved my point by doing exactly what I said they do. Lmao"
1409,c1ar3,Still doesn't make you a woman.
1410,Think__Critically,"That mod is the biggest handmaiden of them all. Any creepy man can do whatever the fuck they want, but a hint of criticism from anyone and it results in a ban. She's only massively against TERFs and transphobes, but anything else seems to be fine."
1411,myousername,">if anybody makes you feel even the smallest bit invalidated...just hit the report button

I really wish people would take actual misogyny this seriously. Nearly every time I call out sexism or misogyny IRL, I'm always told I'm ""making a big deal out of nothing"" or ""calm down, it's just a joke"" or ""you need to have a thicker skin if you want to succeed in business"" or ""just ignore it"""
1412,IndustrialDinge,"Imagine if this post were pinned onto a sub like, idk, r/insert_something_random. How insane. 

""Hey ***~y'all~***!! I know this sub is about [something unrelated to ""gender""] but just so you know, **NO FUCKING TERFS ALLOWED** k thnx byeeee :*)"""
1413,thebackstabkitty,God those comments are sickening
1414,denverkris,"I really have no issue with the sentiment of anyone being allowed to wear makeup, but why the need to specifically mention ""terfs""? Oh wait, I see, they have to mention that they're part of the pompom pickme brigade, got it."
1415,,"""we support women wearing makeup for any reason,"" 

Except when they disagree with you right? Then they're a dirty, rotten, evil slur who deserved to be excluded. Totally not wrong. /s 

Bonus points for the idiot who misspelled philosophy."
1416,kallenill,Make up is more important than women. Period end of story.
1417,tbijou9,"Ok, so let any dirty fetishistic creep in and see your members jump ship like they do with every other sub that’s been infiltrated by the TRAs. They ruin every female dominated sub."
1418,gettheloutasia,Ok so basically misogynists.
1419,wanderingbubble,"How is supporting men wearing makeup an anti-TERF thing to do? You literally acknowledge that gender is not behaviour, which is the definition of gender critical"
1420,,"Little do they know that “TERFs” are fully, 100% supportive of men wearing makeup. We just think that men who want to wear makeup can still identify as men. 

I hope some MUA people come check us out to learn more :)"
1421,ima-terf-im-a-weirdo,"I'm struggling to understand the actual cognitive dissonance these makeup Redditors are displaying.


If they were presented with a real woman's photo of her wearing badly-applied blue eyeliner and nothing else, the post would be very lowly upvoted/ignored, and the comments would consist of a couple of simpering words of encouragement. 


This bloke did not bother to make his eyeliner decent at all, and he's getting thousands of upvotes and women defending him! The best (worst) part is he's a blatantly obvious AGP, and I bet he's wanking to the compliments as we speak. 




I can understand if the poster had immaculately-applied eyemakeup/a completed look, sure, upvote away if there's noticeable skill and creativity, regardless of if it's a guy/girl/trans or not. I have no problem if a transwoman wants to share their makeup efforts if it's clear they put effort into it. Makeup is for everyone.



But this is just pathetic. There had to have been a trans upvote brigade sneakiness thing happening, because it seems too far out to be true."
1422,GreatestClover50,"This is a good measure, in my opinion"
1423,Mocha_Muscles,So from what I gather this is trannys vs panties?
1424,MrCheezyPotato,What does TERF stand for?
1425,JackiLynxcoon,This comment section literally gave me eye cancer
1426,Oreocookies132,Ask yourselves why inclusion makes you so angry.
1427,DitaVonCleese,"from what ive noticed they will praise anyone for bad makeup except the ""normies"". So if there is an 80years old lady or someone exceptionally ugly or handicapped or morbidly obese, they will get praise to no end regardless of makeup. Basically they behave to ""marginalised"" (idk how else to call them) as if they were babies in need of coddling. Which I find actually insulting towards those people."
1428,rakoflo,They do it for free.
1429,crikeyuhoh,">being GNC for a fetish is obviously trans-adjacent""

uh oh! A crack! She is a terf egg."
1430,RAproblems,"""Moist lippy"" is the worst combination of words in the English language..."
1431,themostgravybaby,I couldn’t believe the comment section on that thread...
1432,burntmatchesburn3x,"I will always sub to a female space... even tho I don't wear makeup and don't know how to put it on (and I'd look dumb, lol)."
1433,briar_angel,"There was a post earlier today (maybe yesterday?) of a man who slathered blue dollar store eyeliner on and posted it, receiving hundreds of compliments and over 2k upvotes. It was ridiculous. I've seen toddlers apply makeup better."
1434,femmefr0g,I love that they included the word lesbians lmfao
1435,archaeopteryx79,"If that doesn't prove that this is about silencing women, I don't know what would. You literally told people to research and decide for themselves and got a ban. The guy isn't even trans for fuck's sake."
1436,xx_power,"I always wonder who even makes these cheesey comments each time. Some dude who applied eye shadow worse than I did at age 13 and there's always people going ""you're the most beautiful girl everrrrrr 😍😍😍😍😍 yaaassss queeeen!!!"". Like, who the fuck does that"
1437,jetpatch,"The soft bigotry of low expectations.

The lib fems and the elite love this behaviour, everytime they do it they are declaring themselves massively superior to these people while looking kind, supportive and liberal at the same time. 

It's win win."
1438,catacomb_gurl,"Yeah, exactly, I know a youtuber who has a face deformity and the comments under her videos are always like ""you are so beautiful!"" which shows how they don't actually consider her beautiful and just feel sorry for her."
1439,dr-awkward1978,The guy who heads up the HOA where I live also does it for free.  I see no correlation between getting paid and taking your job waaayyyy too fucking seriously.
1440,jetpatch,"His artistic intent was literally just to give himself an erection. 

If they want to respect that it's on them but it's a bit weird and they probably should change the sub to over 18s only."
1441,crikeyuhoh,"My hackles go up just by being called ""sweetie"" or ""hun"" by anyone I don't know personally (and even then, honestly). It always feels patronizing. I cannot imagine somehow getting satisfied from being patronized to. Unless that is just how you think women should be treated, consider it ""being nice"", and therefor it is 'validating' to be treated like an idiot who survives off of fake compliments. Suppose I just answered my own thought, there."
1442,DitaVonCleese,people coming from drag race sub :D my guess
1443,baconbitsy,The HOA comparison is spot on!
1444,xx_power,"Idk if it's an American thing but it's the same with same sad news or just a mildly sad story: comments over comments saying the same shit ""who's cutting onions 😭😭😭😭"", ""this is the sadest thing I've ever heard, OP you are a strong dog dad 😰😰😰"". Like yeah it's sad if some dude's dog died at 19 from old age but do people really break down crying from reading about this, when they have literally no connection to the OP? Like the compliments, it is SO fake and I wonder every time when someone puts their kid on the frontpage to whore them out for upvotes... Dude, you know it's just some neckbeards literally lying so they get a compliment next? Why do you think you need their validation?"

1451,yesisaiditxx,"Aren’t even people! I’ve been stuck in an airport with 6 delays so far this gave me the laugh I needed. I always thought the “anything you see in others is something within yourself” was wanna-be enlightened bs but it really does seem to ring true with many of their insults (not that they aren’t people, but that their idea of a trans woman who IS a female is not real)."

1461,ESyzygy,Yep! Cis women and cisbians are not women EVEN THOUGH THEYRE CIS
1462,Tweeders55,You should read today's NYT op ed regarding JK Rowling and how disappointed the TIM is who wrote it because Harry Potter helped him come out. Heartbreaking I say with lots of snark. Those poor TIMS so discriminated against and we terfs being terfs just don't understand.
1463,2or3thingsIknow,Most are trying to score woke points by being mean to women who stand up for themselves. The other ones are quiet. They are of no help either.  It's acceptable to dehumanize us. You would think the sheer amount of violent imagery and rape and death threats from trans activists would be enough. But nope. Apparently that's okay. It's really f\*\*ked up.
1464,Peakedalltohell,"It’s beyond hilarious that they consider that to be a scathing insult lmao

“You...you aren’t *valid*!  Bet that hurts!”"
1465,Cardoba,"If any woman require’s validation from a man in a dress that’s sad Lol

The male equivalent would be a woman telling a young man or boy what it means to be a man even though a woman or trans Male is the last person a young Male should ask what it means to be a man since they don’t have the male life experience only the preconceived notion of what it is. That’s why transwomen should stay quiet on women’s issues since they have no understand of what it’s like to be a woman"

1474,Tweeders55,"Beats me. Gandolf was gay not trans and technically wore long flowing dresses,robes and stylish hats while remaining all male."
1475,Tweeders55,Me also. I feel like a failed feminist in not knowing just how far this gone. How did this regression to if a girl prefers to wear pants and vests and comfy shoes make girls boys. How did it happen that boys who wear their hair long or like to wear dresses and make up make them girls. David Bowie died in vain obviously. The New York Dolls meant nothing. All the lesbians who broke ground for gay and women's rights are now being rewritten in history as trans as opposed to the proud women that they were. All the physical mutilation involved being encouraged for children who at 2 years of age saying they don't like their penises so girls they are lets have a national reality tv show with parents encouraging this child mutilate themselves and take testosterone blockers for most of their lives causing immense physical pain and damage to this child (Jazz Jennings) when the parents and doctors would under normal circumstances be thrown in jail and parental rights removed for obvious child abuse. It's all very disgusting and I am a Socialist. As lefty as they come. Ugh.
