0,They simply do not care. Because of all the social capital they have they are literally acting like terrorists and slamming women all over the place.
1,"Honey, the amount of people who use “TERF” to stop a discussion is ridiculous.  “I’m not gonna debate you because you’re a TERF!” followed by a lot of nonsensical insults just proves what they really are: misogynists."
2,You're invalidating the women who menstruate by sticking tomato juice Popsicles in their recta and collecting the meltjuice with tampons and menstrual pads.
3,If you're woman who acknowledges reality you're a terf.
4,[removed]
5,First off all they're not saying MtFs can have periods. They're saying FtMs can still have periods post transition.
6,"They have a ton of time of their hands since 99% of society wants nothing to do with them.

TIMs: “I can be a normal man and go out and achieve a good life for myself or I can sit in my mom’s basement, shriek TERF at her if she questions me stealing my sister’s panties, eat cheetos, stick tomato juice up my ass and mod r/actuallesbians. Hmmm gonna have to go with choice #2!”"
7,Oh dear gawd is this a thing????
8,A few months and they'll use this as an arguement.
9,But testosterone stops periods. So Ftm shouldn't be having them
10,"You know I want to go shake my finger at the youth and yell at them to GTFO my lawn but a lot of the most egregious TIMs are men older than myself (41)

Like, bro, you should know better."
11,I’m ok with r/actuallesbians but only because I only pay attention to the cutesy romantic posts and not the trans/“girldick” ones
12,Well documented.
13,Depends for some it takes a while for it to take effect and some aren’t on hormone replacement yet.
14,I know an FTM that sometimes gets periods for missing hormone doses. A lot of trans people don’t have regular access to treatment. They’re saving up for a hysterectomy. Or technically someone who hasn’t started treatment yet or for some reason doesn’t want medical treatment could identify as trans.
15,Just researched and will now scrub my browser history. Omg
16,Im still going to only say women have periods
17,"Okay that’s fine, I’m just responding to your post saying that an FTM can’t have a period, they sometimes do."

19,"They can change their hair or what they wear, but no matter what they do, a man is still a man"
20,That explains how much violent the response for any skepticism regarding transgenderism is. And because of it I either hide or use my alt account to rise my voice on topics like these.
21,"I had an account locked yesterday on twitter. Unable to have a discussion with said person as they resorted to calling me a bitch and a terf and then the rape threats started. How is it now we live in a world where you can’t disagree anymore? Your opinion means you are fine to be harassed and threatened. 
I stated biology and that women don’t have a penis and there was no coherent argument just abuse."
22,Am I misreading this? It sounds like she doesn't belive both sides behave badly calling it a fallacy and also seems to support jk rowling by saying that those who send her death and rape threats arent women
23,And I opp....
24,What did you do to cause this? Can you link the thread?
25,She doesn’t she’s pointing out how bullshit the claim is

Women have penis’s and I said no they don’t."
27,"she forgot to put /s then, I hate when people are sarcastic online, I usually cant tell because nowdays you can say the most fcked up things and actually mean them"
28,But she’s not being sarcastic..?

32,Had some male say they wanted to cannibalize my uterus for running radfem sapphic page before so this checks out
33,Most TIMs are violent misogynists
34,"Online: I will perform female genital mutilation on you ugly TERF 

IRL: Has a menial remote job, orders everything he needs on the internet, hasn’t talked to a woman in 9 years other than his grandma that he calls on birthdays, never had sex, probably not even out as TIM yet mostly because he doesn’t have anyone to out* himself to

*edit: typo"
35,Who would have thought their mental illness also seeps into every other aspect of their life and personality??
36,"Man, isn’t the internet a wild ride. You read something like this and think it’s a toss up between, “This man would maybe actually violently attack me and hurt me if we ever had a real life confrontation” *or* “One dose of my ability to speak my mind critically and bluntly in real life and I’d make this dude cry.”"
37,But misgendering is *literal violence*. This is fine though.
38,He can't help it.  He's so oppressed.  You wouldn't understand.
39,"I cant wait for the day I can respond to shit like this with, ""Sounds like some internalized misogyny."" because it reminds them that they cant escape the fact that their behavior reflects a male pathology."
40,"Well, thats not very ladylike"
41,So violently jealous of our bodies he's murderous.
42,Totally not an incel though...
43,"I’d like to see him try, I sleep with a gun😉"
44,I wonder if he typed this up during his breaks at the help desk
45,This is a mental illness
46,"But they are a woman, this can't be the case, cause if was that would make them a 
MAN/s..."
47,Man wants to beat and disfigure women because they won’t “shut up ” sounds about right.
48,Isn’t that the stupid kid who then pulled the “I’m just a kid” when everyone was tearing him a new one for saying all that shit?
49,Yet they insist that TERFs (mostly lesbians who just won't suck that D) are the violent ones. Lmfao. What a bunch of wackos.
50,"Ok, Ed Gein."
51,"Is that even possible? If you put your hand far enough inside you'd be inside the uterus, unable to grab it or rip it out."
52,feel the progressiveness...
53,They always focus on the 'female' part of us. Like it's so obvious that they hate us for being women.
54,"literally made me physically recoil.

55,"This is disgusting , I'm gonna need to stay away from males for a bit"
56,Points for creativity? /s
57,He's trying to consume your female essence
58,That’s a rather large brush you’re painting on a group of people?
59,He only calls his grandma on *his* birthday.  Certainly not hers.
60,"lol thats a cope, these could very well be people that look normal to everyone else irl."
61,">“One dose of my ability to speak my mind critically and bluntly in real life and I’d make this dude cry.”

Not that hard, just use the correct pronouns for him 😂"
62,"He's just expressing himself, jeeeeeez /s"
63,Transgendered people are pretty oppressed now they can’t even serve in the US army boo.
64,Very Bufallo Bill like.
65,Same.
66,What being trans?
67,"Who?

I don't remember this."
68,hahaha. yeah that’s better.
69,"""I noticed that there was no cheque in my birthday card this year, grandma. I'm *sure* this was a mistake..."""
70,awwwww they can’t serve in the rape machine that is the us military? tragic. judging by this post the XYs would fit right it.

94,"What we want if for men to stay out of womens spaces. Simple. Fighting for women is a good thing. If that means some men get their little girl panties (that they love wearing so much) in a twist. I ain’t upset. And if they want to use slurs and threaten us while doing it. Well thats hurtful but still inconsequential. Because that report button isn’t just decorative.  I’m standing up for women so men, yeah i dont care if you chop off your dick or wear a dress and makeup.  They’re never gonna be a woman. 
Have a lovely day!"
95,"I love that this is still pissing men off almost a month later. Men who, by the way, are not and never will be women. Sorry you have no life. Big F (whatever that means)"
96,I don’t think i understand what you mean?
97,"Right so how much of that post did you read and how long have the Tims been whispering in your ear? 

Women’s spaces should be for women and women only. These weirdos in wigs and dresses are not and can never be women. No matter how badly they mutilate their genitals. I will not bow down to their behavior and i will not accept insults from “allies” like you.  You contribute to a system that demeans women and denies us our existence. A system that doesn’t even allow lesbian her sexuality anymore. A system where a male mediocre weightlifter can decide today that he is a woman and start winning gold medals in women’s classifications tomorrow. 

Terf is a foul slur usually accompanied by threats of beatings, rapes and murder to women who refuse to cater to men’s fragile ego’s and most notably their autogynephila and fetishes. 
I refuse to be called names by woke weirdos like you who think women should die when all we want is to make men get out of our faces, out of our sports and out of out bathrooms. We dont want them to die, we want them to act like a normal human being. Not a anime doll. But you just echo what they teach you. 

Next time you call someone trash please re-read this message and realize i could have just insulted you right back. But i didnt do that. Now try and see who is the one between us two capable of calm and rational thought and who has used cursewords as their only retort to a woman standing up for herself."
98,"They’re men. The text says nothing about qualification. I wouldnt want to be treated by an unqualfied woman either. But i dint want to be cared for by a man perion.  These are men, not “trans women!?!!” And yes they are attempting to steal women only spaces. They are men. It’s their ultimate goal it seems."
99,Correct i didn’t write it. But i had not seen it on this sub before and loved it. I agree with it completely. Men can get the hell out if womens spaces. They are not welcome. And diaper fetishists too by the way sir!
100,"Terf is used as a slur, by trans rights activists. You'll often hear it in phrases such as ""kill all terfs.""  I think many ""terfs"" agree that ""terf""  is an accurate term when used to mean ""woman who doesn't agree that a man can become a woman."" But trans activists use it to mean, ""Person who refuses to validate my claim to be a woman and therefore should be humiliated, ostracized, and murdered. """

106,"Gotcha, thanks. Are the majority of you also sex-worker exclusionary as well? If you remove delusions of infinite genders, and hedonistic pornographer women being glorified, then I can get behind feminism. I mean, I'm still gonna call obese, dyed haired women ""SJWs""; and I'm sure as hell not denying that men are biologically stronger than women, but other non-sexually-immoral ideologies you guys hold are fine by me."
107,"I’m not against normal men who mind their own business at all. Men can be great. I’m only against trans people if they are men trying to get away with stuff and get into female spaces by wearing dresses and turning their penis inside out or even just claiming they are women while they arent even remotely trying, they are literally just men. I have little to no trouble with women who try to become men. They don’t bother me usually. I say good luck to them. They are still weird but I wish them luck fitting in with men. But men trying to be women. Yeah i have something against them and i will fight against them and for women.  

Every day. 

Again. Have a nice day."
108,"I didnt write it. I do agree with it though. 

I never said YOU were a man. I just said ‘men’ but if you felt like i was talking about you go off i guess. 

And are you sure you’re a woman. Isn’t that enforcing a gender binary which could hurt trans peoples feelings? (Big sarcasm in case you didn’t get that)"
109,"I am indeed not bothered at all by that. Because i care about women and preserving our spaces, not about the fragile ego’s of men who like to wear dresses and want to be called “ma’am”"
110,That dont mean it’s untrue though. Men with a trans fetish are a danger to women. Whether i wrote it or not doesnt make it false.
111,"Radical feminists,  ftom what I read, see ""sex work"" including porn as exploitative."

115,Can you elaborate?
116,"Trans ‘women’ are men. The reason they don’t pass is because they are men. Not women. 

> . Men don’t try to get into female spaces by being trans. 

Lol. It’s 50% “grr i’m not allowed in womens [fill in here: bathroom, locker room, rape shelter, prison] Let’s put on a dress and waltz in, no one will dare stop me”. These are predators out to get weak women and many cases are documented of  so called “trans women” (men) getting permission to go to female prision instead of male and at the very least creeping the fuck out of vulnerable women and at worst rape and hurt them. Many cases about men freaking out for not being admitted to women rape shelters. Cases of men sendingvdeath threats to lesbians who refuse to fuck men with dicks. Of pedophiles who claim to be trans to get lowered sentences. Of men going Into womens bathrooms with ugly dresses and terrible fake wigs just for fun and to terrify women in a space where once they would have come to get away from men. 

And 50% “ i just want to have tits to play with and be submissive slut in bed”. Of which the last one i will admit are usually not quite as nefarious. But they’re definitely AGP."
117,"Fetish? Lol i have literally 0 fetishes.  Your “tendencies” are a fetish. 
I care about women enough to not want men with dicks forcing themselves into lesbian spaces, into women rape shelters, into womens locker rooms, toilets and prisons.  If your main objective is forcing women to just lie down and take it while men like you walk all over them you are not a feminist."
118,[removed]
119,"Fascination with “lady dick”? I have never used that word except to express my disgust at the word. Maybe you mistook my disgusted frustration at men referring to penises as a “girldick” for fascination, HalfBreed?

Men like you saying stuff like ‘kill terfs’ are inciting violence against women yet somehow i’m the one who doesnt care about women? Thats cute dude! Such a male thing to do!
Hope you have a great day!"

121,"Frustration at Lack of having a maledick. Lol. No thanks. Dick can be nice, but not on me, only in me.

Threatening and harassing women who have already been traumatized because they don’t want another male predator in their fucking rape shelter. Oger is a first class narcissistic, misogynistic creep who should be shamed instead of applauded."
159,Note: The Rape Relief Women’s Shelter was defunded because of these men.
160,A few months old but I wanted to sticky something about this.
161,"No outrage from the woke, I presume."
162,"deplorable. :( one of my old lib fem friends who devotes her life to being a TRA used to live in Vancouver and vacations there regularly. sounds like a beautiful city, so what an absolute shame to see lib fems terrorize the place. I hope all the women using this shelter and/or their services are kept safe."
163,This makes me wish for a mass extinction.
164,"Creeping through their subs, they still believe it's their god given right to be in shelters and centers. 

How fucking barbaric and narcissistic must you be to demand services that push out the original sex it was meant for."
165,I was so brainwashed by TRAs up until a few months ago that this wasn't even my peak moment. Truly unbelievable. And lib fems don't have a fucking thing to say when I use this example of why exclusivity is paramount for women's spaces.
166,"If something sums up these people's utter hatred and contempt for women, this is it. The fact they are demanding women who have been traumatised by men and their male bodies allow them into the one space that is meant to be totally free of those traumatic elements, simply to validate their 'true and honest womanhood' is nothing short of horrifying. If a literal rape crisis centre isn't safe, where is?

They want to allow men who have a sexual fetish regarding objectifying women into a slew of outdated sexist stereotypes into a place where women are healing from sexual trauma. Where they will most likely exude exhibitionism and sexually harass these vulnerable women. All for sexual gratification and their own validation. TIMs claim to need these centres, and some may, but I believe the number of them that truly need shelter may be quite low and the rest are just creepy boundary pushing AGPs. Yet when they are offered separate accommodations away from the women, that just isn't good enough, they must be treated as exactly the same as a biological woman, even though they are NOT the same and belong to the group who victimised the women in the first place. That tells you all you need to know. They do not care about the actual shelter, they just care they're not included and not being constantly validated. So selfish."
167,quintessentially trans.

196,Posted with the usual cartoon or anime profile picture.
197,"Hup herrm, gays most certainly exist, but Lesbians, no, not those horrible exclusionist  uterus havers who discriminate against the girl dick because of ther stupid and ignorant genital preference. They are like, totally not valid, like /s

198,Lesbians eat whaaat!? No way!
199,You ever notice TIFs never say this shit about gay guys?
200,"I-

Bro I’m homoSEXual AND WTF?

I do care about ur privates if (in the far far future) I have sex with you. I am going to talk about menstruation and pregnancy and that doesn’t make me a terf. That makes you homophobic and anti-feminist."
201,"They should lead by example.  Let's start with them ""liking"" their own bodies/genitals.  Why should we be the ones to do the conversion therapy?"
202,I mean you are correct. Gender dysphoria is in the dsm
203,Anime is a perfect representation.  It's fantasy fiction.
204,"I’m offended (no not really) I have it too.

They’re cute though!"
205,Yeah they fucking do.
206,Really? I’ve have never seen that. I’ve only ever seen TIMs doing it.

208,"I was just looking at it, and saw one, but up until now I’ve only ever seen TIMs doing it though. I wonder why that is."

This is one of the worst ones I've seen so far."
212,“Sorry to hear you felt assaulted but we all know women don’t really feel fear for rational reasons and it was probably an overreaction on your part sweetheart x “ /s
213,"Oh I'm so sorry to hear about your experience and ptsd... but you'll still find a way to swallow it down for the comfort of men, right? 

Oh I'm so sorry that you were raped, but you still understand that *not all men* do that, right? You musnt forget to say that before and after you apologetically share what happened to you. 

Oh I'm sorry the rape crisis center was defunded by a man, but I hope you understand it's because those women were bigots for wanting to heal privately and with dignity. Their wants outweigh your needs, because as a woman, you are everything they wish they were. This is ""privledge"", not objectification. 

Oh I'm so so sorry to hear you didnt place in your sport after training your whole life because men now compete in womens sports. But the fact they get the limited scholarships and opportunities for women, should really be an inspiration for you to just work harder and be quietly supportive.

Oh I'm so so VERY sorry that abortions are punishable by a life sentence in certain states and getting harder and harder to access, but it seems so exclusionary since transwomen dont get to experience this, so we shouldn't focus on it. The most important thing is that everything is about transwomen all the time. If it's not, then it's about how it hurts them that it's not, and THAT is the important peice of every puzzle. 

Oh, you dont like the red robes they are rolling out...I'm so so so sorry about that. But it's because you are lucky enough to be born a woman. I wish I was a woman, red is definitely my color and the cap hides my male pattern baldness UwU"
214,"omg, just unfollow her like she asked. It's clear from her post and he knows it."
215,That’s a punchable face if I ever saw one
216,"Still ridiculous to me that they have to push so much that “trans women *are* women.” Like ok, if they’re really women, why do they have to specify the trans part? Why not just say they’re women and be done with it? 

Why? Because they know it’s bullshit. They know trans women aren’t really women."
217,>Yeah sorry about the assault but what about MY **DICK**
218,Men are dangerous? But I’m not like other men!
219,i.... what a fucking male response.
220,Does anyone really believe that transwomen are women? Deep down in their heart of hearts?
221,That was so creepy and policing.
222,"Saying trans women are women over and over again doesn’t make it true, seriously I feel like these people think they have the power to hypnotize."
223,"If men weren't dangerous they wouldn't be in women's bathrooms or women's prisons. 

We don't have to center Trans women in are women-only spaces. They forcibly center themselves in those spaces.

Can you imagine writing a Tweet, and someone randomly comes out the woodwork of the Twitterverse to correct the possiblity of  you uttering Wrongthink?

It's just so tiresome."
224,"Fuck you, dude on the bottom. DIAF."
225,"ok i actually just searched the phrase ""you're including trans women"" and so many results came up i'm afraid to read into that collective nightmare"
226,...Ok.. I would say something that would get me banned so I just stay quiet.
227,"Looks like that boy needs to grow up, if that is truly him in his profile pic....."
228,Disgusting!
229,That’s not at all what was said but ok
230,"Lol, omg that got me good. 

If I wasn't laughing so hard I would be crying..."
231,The sad/concerned look on it reminds me of Kate McKinnon’s version of Justin Bieber 🙈
232,Please let us not lower ourselves to their level.
233,They think if they repeat it enough times people will believe it.
234,"You know it reminds me of the vampire movies and t. v. shows.

238,I almost downvoted this out of disgust
239,I'm glad it's illegal to send unsolicited dick pics in Texas.
240,"Are these underage girls? Because this person would then be sending porn to minors... 
even if adults this is still is illegal right? It’s sexual harassment? 
If this happened to me I would contact the authorities. If this person is willing to go this extreme over this minor bs then they’re probably willing to do even worse stuff in real life to women and girls and should be scared of the consequences"

244,"They can send all that shit to me.  I’ll not give a fuck, and I’ll contact the FBI as it more than likely crosses state lines.  And I’ll continue to fuck with that person by sending them videos of detransitioning people and radical feminist lectures."

Just emotionally harass them till they all give up (/s)"
254,"Regardless, ladies, I think we’re doomed. Who with a real life can hold a candle to someone with this kind of free time on their hands? 🤷‍♀️"
255,As if it mattered why these girls received dick picks. The man in a dress with a penis is blaming the victims for “provoking” him.

257,"it is? damn texas, you did something right"

264,Best idea ever.
265,"I’d rather not die of alcohol poisoning if it’s all the same to you, thanks."
266,doomed? nah we go back into stealth mode until it normalizes again. and by that i mean talk to every female you know in real life about this. I have not encountered 1 female friend that has been pro trans; we're all confused by it. Don't text or IM or rely on public social media to discuss this. This conversation is best had in person.
267,"Lol just don’t open DMs. Mention in your accounts (bios, posts, whatever) that you don’t read DMs. They have no power"

269,I hoped this wasn't real and then I read your comment.

Sounds reasonable and not at all like something someone incredibly mentally unstable might say. 

People are really okay with this stuff being said. This was posted in another sub, and I said there and will say here, I cannot believe other women (allies and supporters) can hear and read stuff like this and not see a problem.

Also, I remember the Tumblr account of the person who posted this. She (a 15 year old TIF) was infamous for claiming to have about 6 severe mental illnesses, constantly sending death threats and using racial slurs. Truly depressing what certain sectors of the Internet have done to young people."
283,I’d like to see who this person has called terf then replace their mentions of terf with the name of the person he called terf.

288,"Regardless of what he calls himself, a man wrote this. This is the language that a piece of shit man would use."
289,"WTF? Even compared to the vile garbage usually spotlighted in this sub this one made me literally nauseous to read. TIMs hate me when I point out how many serial killers and other sex predators display some form of trannssexualism or autogynephilia. Well, this kind of shit that they post is why that is a more than fair point to make."

291,Men will always fantasise about sex-based violence

Yet demanding that women get raped to death and or tortured to death is perfectly healthy and normal and should be allowed in the name of free speech.

400,Well keep a look out on r/thisneverhappens  when something happens it will be posted there. Its not a matter of if. Thinking you are of the opposite sex is a symptom of at least metal instability (imo a symptom of mental illness) and mental instability can (not necessarily) lead to deadly situations. So it just a waiting game for now.
401,"When you think you are the opposite sex you are most definitely mentally ill. Its like saying you are born in the wrong body and that you are an alien from galaxy 1000 miles away. It's not real. It's a mask for something else. A personality disorder, childhood trauma, even trauma in later life, autism, internalized homophobia, internalized misogyny, plain old misogyny (when it comes to men claiming to be women) etc. It's a symptom. Not an actual thing. But it's also a multi billion business that preys on the unstable. As long as there are people that can make a shit load of money on the mentally disturbed they will. Providing actual help doesn't make people as much money. And as long as people sign a contract that says informed consent, they can actually get away with it. It's vile and grotesque.

Every single person that claims to be of the opposite gender is at least highly mentally unstable and often times mentally ill."
402,"Exactly. Sorry, but I'm a huge fan of kind shaming. No one needs to know about that shit."

409,"I don't want to type the name out in case he namesearches himself, but the crayon eater's username is very familiar. I think I've seen troubling things he said pop up on other subs.

actually, Google that username if you want to report him. He has a thread on the green fruit site. They know exactly who he is."
410,Exactly what I was thinking. It’s already happened. Hardly any libfems even know about trans criminals because discussing them is “literally violence”.
411,"You seem to not understand modern gender theory. What makes someone a certain gender is a combination of three things. 1) identity (what gender you see yourself as), 2) body (what physical characteristics society prescribes to different genders), and 3) presentation (what behaviors are prescribed to certain genders, an example would be gender roles). You’ll notice that chromosomes have nothing to do with it. So long as Trans people fit two out of those three things, they **are** the opposite gender, your opinion on the subject is irrelevant.  They aren’t mentally ill. Gender dysphoria still is a mental illness, of course, but for separate reasons, and a lot of trans people aren’t dysphoric.

Also, it’s not a mask, sure there are trans people who change in order to cover up past trauma, but the vast majority are sincere in their beliefs. 

May I ask, what do you think would actually help trans people beyond surgery? Therapy wouldn’t do anything beyond maybe making them more suicidal, that’s for sure."
412,"Report to the [FBI](https://tips.fbi.gov/). You can submit a tip online. I've submitted tips twice before. Both times an agent called me back promptly and seemed to take it seriously.  

Also, the [U.S. Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/how-do-i/report-suspicious-activity) has suggestions.  

>""If You See Something, Say Something®"" is a national campaign that raises public awareness of the indicators of terrorism and terrorism-related crime, as well as the importance of reporting suspicious activity to state and local law enforcement.  

I'll be reporting to both. This is above Reddits paygrade, nor do I trust them to actually do anything about it."
413,"Yep, he's a real psycho that one."
414,"I heard all that bs before and it's a cry for attention. There males and females. Gender roles are bs. Chromosomes determine your sex, which equals your gender. The end. Basic biology. So called trans people need psychological help to determine what is truly the matter with them: a personality disorder, autism, trauma (sexual or other wise), internalized homophobia/misogyny. The only reason it isn't qualified as a mental disorder officially is because it has become a multi billion industry. The profits made to mutilate so called transgenders are so incredibly high. So of course they want the medical world to say its okay and normal. Trans people do not exist. It's as simple as that. A d you know it too else you wouldn't be commenting here. You are looking for validation from people who are telling you the truth. If you can convince us, you can convince yourself. I wish you the best. And I hope you find proper help to help you with either you personality disorder or your past trauma you haven't dealt with yet. Good luck.

BTW if you aren't dysphoric, no need to mutilate your body either and pump it full with hormones your body isnt meant to produce. You know doing that when you aren't dysphoric doesn't make sense."
415,"Thank you for reporting this to the FBI. This is exactly what the “If You See Something, Say Something” Campaign was designed for."
416,"Did you end up reporting?  Did they take it seriously?  Would it help if others called in as well, just to add numbers to the voice of concern?"
417,"I did end up reporting. I'm not sure how seriously they took it, since I no longer answer unknown numbers. I would think it wouldn't hurt if others called it in or submitted tips online."

( Correction: in order to not feed into delusional thinking I did indeed edit pronouns in my previous comment in order to reflect reality.) 

You understood it clearly enough. You don't have to be a girly girl, you can have short hair, you can have your breasts removed--you can take hormones if you want because its your body and you can do what you want with it --but how you express your personal aesthetics has exactly zero impact on biological fact.  You're still a woman and the rest of the world has no obligation to play along with your fantasy.

Turns out, I enjoy this corner of reddit more than all the other increasingly ridiculous subs and now am hardly ever on my “actual” account. So, this is my actual account :) I’d take participating in these spaces over the rest if that’s how it has to be. 

I don’t mean any disrespect to her (the mod) but someone who obviously thinks sex work is a fine way to make money and continuously responds with condescension when someone confesses details of her rape? Dear, her ability to think outside the rules of the TRA cult is barely there, if at all. So many people on reddit get a thrill out of witch (pun heh) hunting “terfs”.

But of course a traumatic response towards ""AMAB"" people isn't valid by their standards. In what universe is telling someone who isn't hurting anyone to ""manage your trauma like everyone else"" appropriate? There's something really insidious about this that I can't quite put my finger on, it's as if the mod feels entitled to your emotional state, as if the insides of your brain are obligated to be free of any thoughtcrimes against TIMs. This framing of trauma as something ""problematic"" that you basically need to get over for the benefit of others is absolutely vile."

546,"They booted me as well. I never once posted there, but apparently they stalked my subs, and found me not worthy. 🤨"
547,I'm sorry you went through this and had someone pursue you like that. That's really horrible and i don't understand why anyone would act like crybaby teenagers matter more than survivors of abuse. Good riddance to that sub
548,"I'm pretty sure the mod was jerking off reading your attempts to explain yourself.

Just disgusting."
549,Is it just an instant ban for anybody who participates in subs they don’t like? Hmm. So much for being against the patriarchy. Women being silenced again.
550,"reddit is saturated with men, even in the woman subs.  As moderators.   Colonization"
551,"Men have distorted all female-centric mythological symbols to decorate their necrophiliac religions. It's not surprising that they want to appropriate the words and symbolism of witches as well.   


We can't have anything female."
552,"The moment you were banned you became the enemy. Nothing you could have said would have changed their mind, not even ass-kissing. You can tell by how fucking rude and insensitive the replies were. Not an ounce of sympathy. 

Better put up a headstone with ""witchesvspatriarchy"", cuz it's another one dead by the hands of men."
553,"JUST GET OVER YOUR TRAUMA, BRO

&#x200B;

fucks sake, this is so infuriating. these people are monsters who genuinely believe they're good people or ""on the right side of history"". what a fucking piece of shit"
554,"Dear witcheswholovepatriarchy, please ban me from your shitty sub, I’m an atheist, a radfem, and also I will report you to the admins for harassment.

Love, crispycherrypie"
555,Aren’t they peak libfem but in Wiccan flavour?
556,"I'm sorry about what happened. That 'just get over it' response was genuinely annoying to me. As someone who was also assaulted in a bathroom. 

Sometimes this 'you're a TERF nyah nyah' attitude really comes across as dumb meangirls-esque gatekeeping. Like they get some high horse satisfaction from it."
557,"Yep, that sub is trans cult handmaiden land."
558,So I guess we have to make a ActualWitchesVSPatriarchy sub then
559,I got a ban (never commented there at all) saying “Bigots not welcome.” They’re a joke.
560,Sounds like a TIM. Typical how they try to control everything and everyone to keep their fantasy world.
561,"> Witches vs. Patriarchy will always stand for trans rights.

Patriarchy wins by forfeit."
562,"Anyone in for helping create a new witch based sub? 

r/RadWitches"
563,WOPs.
564,"Remember, men's feelings always come over women's safety to libfems. Esp if the guys in a dress. 

It blows my mind how proclaimed feminists can somehow do the mental gymnastics required to rationalise elevating men who wish they were female above actual females. It's exactly like Orwell's 1984. The truth is lies, and lies are truth. Once enough people start proclaiming 2 plus 2 is five, others will follow. The social acceptance is too important to them. We are being socially engineered to believe bizarre and illogical concepts. 

These women who don't give a fuck they're walking back women's rights 120 years and who deride, mock and exclude women concerned for the status of our sex are absolute traitors."
565,this is so horrible. im so so sorry. 😥
566,"I just got banned from news for asking why the “girls suing to block participation of transgender athletes“ was locked.

Then they called me a terf.

I am so concerned about the ongoing suppression of any thoughts that deviate from the party line.

Why is it ok to call people terfs? Is their “movement” a house of cards that they fear any information or perspective that differs, will collapse the trans lobby?

What other group of people are threatened and silenced in our society now? 

Why is it allowed?"
567,"I almost said something like “JK Rowling is kinda right”

On a post that included this picture: https://i.redd.it/kjh1eqksdl541.png

But then I realized they would ban me so I didn’t.

Edit: that sounds kinda oppressive doesn’t it?"
568,"Thank you, but no worries, I’m used to it :) and at least we know what the mods there are really like now. Don’t expect them to treat you like like a human."
569,That sub is radical feminist horseshit. There's no logic or reason to it.
570,"I have no idea what their criteria is for banning people. Do they not like lesbians? Are the mods actually homophobic? It seems so weird. Especially that mods for a “feminist” sub would try to shame and guilt me for not being able to shake off my trauma as easily as a sex worker.

Well, sorry for having been raped and abused and not healing fast enough from it, your majesty. Like wtf?!?"
571,"They banned me, after I made my first comment. It had nothing to do with trans, or gender issues. I complemented someone for getting a new job. I was subsequently banned. When I asked why, they said I was a terf. They must have gone thru my comment history. I’m guessing one of the witches, was really a warlock🤷🏽‍♀️"
572,"I was not even subscribed to them and got banned.

Truth is forbidden. 

Only trans doctrine allowed."
573,Me too! Just sent me a message one day to say that I'm banned because I'm a terf.
574,"Just insanity, I thought we were way past victim blaming now. Fine if they don’t agree with “lesbians are lesbians” (that would just mean they’re ignorant), but why be such dicks about it?"
575,So many people here are saying this! They must have some sort of bot that checks all subs they deem to be unsavoury.
576,"Thank you. Yes, it seems like they’re either properly brainwashed, or have absolutely no empathy whatsoever for women. I’m glad that reading it back they do come across as the irrational, cruel one, and not me :)"
577,"Oh my, I didn’t pick up on that! So true."
578,"Yeah, seems like they don’t understand their own rules. Or they’re so tone deaf that they really don’t see it"
579,"My abusers continually loved to minimise my issues, while expecting me to elevate theirs to astronomical levels. I did get a very bad (dangerous) vibe from the way the mod was writing.

Especially from their last comment telling me to “try not to be so foul”.

Definitely not a feminist."
580,It really felt like that. I’ve only ever had men talk to me like that.
581,"If that is so, then it all makes a bit more sense."
582,It seems like they’re not feminists at all. Was an eye opener for me.
583,"Exactly! These people want me to stay home and quiet while they take over our hard fought for spaces? Fuck all of that!

At the moment a transwoman is trying to say that I’m sexist and rely on stereotypes. I’m a woman. I don’t need to rely on stereotypes to be a woman, a just am a woman! The cheek of some of these people.

(I must say that this is the only trans person that I’ve ever met or spoken to that believe that he is now a female, and really hates women, with a passion it seems. I assume because he can never be one. He’s not converting anyone to his cause of opening up all women’s spaces to men.)"
584,"Thought it was just a bit of harmless memes, not that it was run by this type of victim blaming person."
585,"So weird. They really have nothing better to do than to go in search of people that don’t participate in the sub, and just ban them anyway!"
586,They use masstagger
587,Thank you. Definitely good riddance to it! :)
588,"Yeah, there’s a definite creepy male vibe around it. I wish I knew which mod it was."
589,"Yep, just women being silenced, especially if you mention lesbians apparently :/"
590,You can even be interested in knowing what the other side thinks. That's wrongthink. Banned.
591,"We really can’t. And really well put, I don’t think of it like that."
592,"Pretty sure the mod is a man. Hard to take their claim of sexual assault seriously after dismissing mine so easily. Seemed more like they wanted to get into a dick swinging contest about “who’s more fucked up/managed to get over it”.

Also, thou would have won anyway, as I don’t have a dick"
593,Right? Like what the actual fuck? And all I did was dare to say that lesbians are only interested in women :D
594,"Judging by everyone else here, you probably will be :D"
595,Not sure really. I didn’t realise that lesbians were a touchy subject for anyone except incels.
596,"""Get over it"" is the mantra of the abusive asshole."
597,"Fuck, I’m sorry. It really doesn’t help that men are now allowed to roam around freely in them, and be applauded for doing it. It is still extremely difficult for me to use a public bathroom without having flashbacks/panic attacks. I hope you’re doing ok."
598,"I’m glad I know now, and I’m glad others know about it too. The way that mod tried to bully me is exactly what another transwoman is also trying to do to me :D Exactly the same points: “your ptsd is nothing”, “my feelings are more important than women’s safety”, “get over it”.

So scary how they seem to have the same points when it comes to hating women and trying to keep us quiet, good little slaves.

If they actually want to be women, why do they hate us so much?"
599,Oooh!
600,Definitely a ridiculous sub that only wants the “right” kind of women participating.
601,It really is frightening how they’ve managed to fool so many people.
602,Joined!!!
603,Witches Of Patriarchy? For a moment I got [really confused](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wop)
604,"I couldn’t quite believe what they were saying, like literally dumbfounded! Up is down, left is right, and I swear I died years ago and all this madness is some sort of hell. Or I’m in a coma somewhere and my dreams are just getting more and more surreal."
605,"What? Wasn’t that post massively popular?

This is what we have to endure now. This is the next big stand we have to take as women. When people try to silence you and threaten you instead of talking, then we know how dictatorial they are.

Keep it up though! It doesn’t matter how much they abuse us and try to intimidate us into silence, we’ll keep going!"
606,It is nothing close to radical feminist.
607,"They all seem to be trapped in the LibFem world view where any dissonance is literal violence.  I can’t take this garbage any more.  I used to be just like them; plugging my ears to anyone who was labeled TERF by the community without even looking into what they said myself.  

Years ago though, that used to be actual homophobic, super religious people on Twitter who have serious problems with gay and GNC people in the first place. 

Today all you have to do is be caught fraternizing with the “enemy”.  I wish these little buggers would just GROW UP already.  Especially as an American, I’m worried that they are unknowingly chipping away at our free speech rights."
608,"Nobody likes lesbians, we only have each other (and that’s why they’re trying to reinvent our existence, so we don’t even have language to describe it)"
609,"A lot of mods on reddit are TIMs, specially in women subs. Sometimes they set up an automatic ban if you post or comment in any subreddit they find threatening. I was banned from subs I never even went to because I comment and post on gendercritical. 

This is their way to silence us and keep people from knowing the truth."
610,"Yeah, for me they said “no bigots allowed”"
611,LMAO what a perfect way to put it.
612,"They use masstagger, it automatically flairs other users who have posted in 'bad' subs like this one. They generally have no clue what your 'bad' posted were, or how long ago you made them, they just see the flair and ban immediately."
613,"You've been tagged. There's a program for Reddit called masstagger. It was supposed to be used for REAL members of Hate Subreddits; White men who are anti-Semitic, racist, think that certain minorities should be genocide etc. But they are also using it on anyone who has visited what they term ""GC"" Subreddits.

The MODs can see the tags. They no longer have to go through your history."
614,[removed]
615,I’m sorry this happened to you. WVP ‘tis a silly place anyway.
616,"Yeah, it’s pathetic. If I knew how to report them for that shit, and thought it was worth my time, I would."
617,Masstagger. They call it a hate speech finder 🙄 hate speech being loosely defined as anyone they disagree with
618,"A disproportionate number of them are in sex work and IT, so."
619,[removed]
620,"Oh yeah, it’s a bot for sure."
621,"They transformed the Triple Goddess into an all-male trinity which erases femaleness from the act of creation. They transformed the tree of life, a symbol of the Goddess and creation, into a cross which is no less than a dead tree in which a dead man is nailed. They substituted Lilith with a male-born subservient Eve. They replace Myrine, also known as Marian, a moon/sea-goddess, known as mother of all gods, with a virgin subservient, completely null Mary, the virgin mother of god who is merely a vessel in an all-male creation myth. They subverted the symbolism of the cauldron to the chalice containing the blood of Christ (could it be more necrophiliac and cannibalistic than that?). I could go on and on. All they did with female-centric mythology was subvert all life-giving, life-creating symbols to all-male ""creators"" who worship death and destruction."
622,"Unfortunately for lesbians, being attracted only to women is now the height of bigotry.  If you’re not into penises you’d better either unlearn your fetish and have sex with penises or cop a beating terf (and then have sex with penises)

Yay progress."
623,"Completely understand. It's one of the more frustrating aspects of this dumb bathroom debate. Mostly because I feel people with so called good intentions don't wanna admit that people do bad things. Well, correction, men do bad things to women and little girls and it's somehow outside the realm of their understanding that YES men would certainly lie to take advantage of a situation to gain access to someone vulnerable. And funnily enough, men agree on some level that men can't be trusted. 

The arguement 'oh well, if they want to assault women a law against not being in the bathroom won't stop them' which, true it won't. But by that same logic we just shouldn't have gun control cuz 'people are gonna get guns illegally if they want them'. But a law is the law and having a societal barrier that says 'men should not be in women's bathrooms' is more of a deterrent than just breaking it down and saying 'yep! Men welcomed! Go on in boys!'    

I hope you're doing well, too. That sub can kick rocks."
624,"Not forever. They are losing the sympathetic ignorance that gave them so much power. Every single time there’s a “controversy” and they reply with their nonsense more people are waking up. 

The JK Rowling issue brought so many people to our subs, and once someone finds out the truth there’s no going back."
625,"Yeah. 

*Damn, it’s taken. 

I should have known better."
626,That person is a troll who just hates anything connected to women.
627,"This is all about free speech rights. They've been chipped away at slowly but surely for years now. But the whole societal idea that it's okay to suppress and silence speech you disagree with but totally not okay to do the same to anybody you agree with is becoming more and more acceptable. If you don't support free speech for those you disagree with, you do not support free speech at all. That cornerstone of free speech is totally eroded. Those gullible people are being taken advantage of and encouraged and propagandized to in order to pass through laws and societal norm changes. We are not free any longer.

*I may not agree with what you say - but I will defend to the death your  right to say it*"
628,"> Especially as an American, I’m worried that they are unknowingly chipping away at our free speech rights. 

Oh, they are definitely doing that. This is part of what's driving me away from the left. There are certainly a lot of nuts on the right, and they might say they don't like what you have to say, but you don't see a whole lot of them trying to outlaw your ability to say it."
629,"Fuck that. Lesbians exist, you exist, and the way they’re creepily trying to shame/guilt lesbians into sleeping with males is disgusting."
630,"Noop Nopity nopE noooo

idc if the dick is on a self proclaimed girl, I do not like it."
631,Why is this happening? How have we regressed so much? Women need to wake up and stick together.
632,"They use that masstagger app as well that flags all users of apparent 'hate subs' which is defined as basically anybody who disagrees with far left political ideology such as conservatives, Trump supporters, anyone who dares to question the trans cult, etc etc. Which clearly are not hate groups."
633,Such irony!
634,"They developed it for Trump supporters iirc. They just consider anything or anyone  who disagrees with them to be spouting hate speech. Most, in fact 99%, Trump supporters are not racists or genocidal. Whereas these fuckers want to rape and exterminate us for disagreeing. There are evil members of every political group that exists."
635,"Wow, that mod really seems to hate lesbians. What the fuck? Why call your sub a feminist sub, but hate lesbians?"
636,what is AHS? sorry
637,Like [Castle Camelot](https://imgur.com/gallery/YMoa5ej)? :)
638,Maybe if we all did something might actually happen. I’ll have to look into it.
639,Why sex work? Are they really?
640,remove active links and use np links.
641,I love this comment. Saving it for when I need to remember to keep fighting. Thank you.
642,"I’m so horrified by this, and when I first heard about it I actually couldn’t believe it until I saw it for myself.

I am horrified for lesbians. That is just so wrong."
643,"Saving this comment, as you put it so well! People just want to be blind to what some people are capable of doing to others. And we somehow get blamed for it, or shamed, or not believed.

They can go fuck themselves. Stay strong."
644,"I really hope so. But I agree, once we wake up there is no turning back. I can’t believe that I ever was one of those people pretending that men are women, and saying that children should be abused as tortured so the can “transition”.

We need everyone to wake up fast, as it is getting way out of hand."
645,:D
646,"Haven’t they already chipped it? 

If mods can mute you, if you can get banned for saying transwomen are not females and that biology can’t be erased,  if you get called a terf for speaking our truth: where are our free speech rights?"
647,TIMs tend to spend a lot of time online in general (and work in the tech field). They try to infiltrate in so many things to control from within.. twitter is one example. They even manipulate articles and highlights in the news section.
648,There are multiple Subreddits where members are also members of T_D.
649,"It's this whole Queer Women's perspective that homosexual Lesbians, unlike the them, don't believe the mantra ""Trans women are women."" This is a terrorible timeline for young lesbians. Lesbians realized first these were just feminized straight men."
650,r - AgainstHateSubreddits
651,"Exactly. 

Seriously tho, that place (as much as I like some of the art posted) gets so much wrong. Silly is exactly what I think of."
652,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24313294
653,"I was one too, completely ignorant because because I blindly trusted their claims. A lot of them are mentally ill *and* deluded which is a dangerous combo, I remember lurking the MTF sub years ago and one of them said his neovagina self-lubricated just like a real one, I was like wow. Now I know what a load of bs that was."
654,"Okay and you could say that for a lot of subs though. 
It's not okay to persecute people and do the equivalent of a yellow star on the chest for following a sub."
655,"How did we get to this point? Where lesbians are being told that they’re transphobic and bigoted for not wanting to sleep with males. It’s just wrong, and actually rape if those poor women are successfully coerced.

It’s nightmarish."
656,"I only just realized. If you look thru my comment history I used to stand up for trans people saying straight people are teed but then I finally realized that I was really stupid.

Some trans people don’t do that, but a lot do."
657,"I saw it and thought the art and some memes were enjoyable, but didn’t realise how silly it really is. And you’ve really found the prefect word: silly! A bit juvenile, and feeling threatened if anyone uses the “wrong” language."
658,Oh shit.
659,"It is scary. It’s so weird how people with mental health problems have blackmailed us into pretending we also have those delusions. I have nothing against people with mental health problems, I’ve got plenty myself, but I don’t tell everyone else to change laws just to make me happy."
660,All those Subreddits have members who are also members of T_D. These same members were on r/worldnews today hoping that nCoronavirus would wipeout a good portion of the Chinese population.
661,"Because the TQ+++ coopted the LGB. This was all done with the lie of Stonewall and 2 generations of LGBTQ students indoctrinated on College and University campuses with Queer Theory and Gender Studies classes. The 2nd generation also was indoctrinated on Tumblr.

The problem with both generations is they either don't want to study LGB History or the History they are reading has been adulterated with a Transwashed Narrative."
662,"We were talking about being masstagged. The MODs have special tools were they can see the tags, so they don't have to go through the post histories. But Trans people who aren't MOD probably still look at the comment section."
663,Doesn't mean all of the people there support that and deserve to be tarred with the same brush due to the actions of a minority.
664,"I heard that you can’t just take something like lgb history, it’s now lgbtq history or something. Like a lot of the courses are changing specifically to include this stuff."
665,Oh I meant that I used to support tans before I got called a TERF for talking about pregnancy.
666,"This is a Sub for women, whose only transgressions is that they recognize the threat to their Civil Rights Movement and the strides that have been made, by Trans Identity politics. 

We don't need you here to try to state a case of T_D and not all Sub members. The corruption, graft, misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia anti-Semitism, racism and the shredding of Constitutional laws of the Trump Administration will be taught in  Political Science, Economics and History departments for decades to come."
667,Yes they are.
668,"I'm just letting you know, that if you have tools now. You might already be tagged."
669,"Were you paying any attention to the previous Obama administrations violations by any chance?

And I am well aware of what this sub is for, btw. I'm GC and a woman, and I contribute regularly to GC subs. And I'm not a trump supporter here to defend him, I'm simply a realist and equal opportunity political party and candidate skeptic, democrat or republican I don't trust you.

 I don't like *any* politicians. But Obama was just as bad, esp on grace violations of law and process, as well as war crimes, he was just the liberal media's golden boy and it wasn't publicised. Even though the economy was a mess. I think it's disingenuous to think Trump is the only problem and that all his supporters are pitch fork wielding racists when the same problems existed long before trump."
670,It’s so insidious.
671,"Ok! Thanks! 

I don’t really care if they kick me out of AL- I still have a bunch of other groups. I’ll miss the romance and stuff, but I bet that’s on TL too."
672,This is so goddamn hilarious and on-point.
673,This belongs on r/TrollGC for future reference.
674,No idea where the white stereotype comes from when so many of us are openly poc. I'd love to do a survey to figure out how diverse we really are
675,"Yeah, I don't see why someone would want to threaten someone with a different opinion with murder. I thought everyone can have their own opinions?"
676,The 'venmo me' tee is a nice touch
677,This is exactly the average larper trans creep.
678,I want to Venmo the artist of this lmaooo so true
679,Does anyone else think that this kind of post weakens the purpose of this subreddit?
680,"i dont usually like strawmen because they exaggerate issues and present obnoxious minorities as representatives an entire community and issues that should rather be maturely debated

682,I’m not white tho
683,"The main reason why they attack white women is a because they want to be put in a “victim” position in their heads. 

They talk like stereotypical SJW WOC. Everything is a stereotype for them, like a fantasy life."
684,Apparently I’m white! Looks like I don’t know my own ethnicity 🤷🏻‍♀️
685,"Same.  I’ve been semi-out as a radfem for a while, but recently I’ve stopped playing their bullshit language games and openly calling TIMs men.  Most of the women I know who agree with me are WOC (like myself)."
686,They want to be able to slag off women without appearing like just your average misogynist - going after 'white women' instead of just 'women' is how they try and hide their true nature.
687,"I’m in complete agreement. I’ve seen so many Twitter conversations that go like this, with the inevitable, “Oh, wow, this post sure took off! By the way, since you’re here...” It’s pathetic how common it is to see - I’m curious if it really works, tbh, or if the cold hard reality of TRAs being too self-absorbed to help means the “burden” falls on ww trying to buy their way into being woke, and, by then, maybe a handful actually follow through."
688,"Because it’s made in satire by a radfem instead of a TRA? I think once in a while is fine, but you have a good point too. 🤔"
689,Me too! I wonder if my membership in the Black Panthers (in my youth) will be retroactively cancelled? Food for thought🤷🏽‍♀️
690,"It's because it's not genuine - and it weakens the list of genuine attacks - and there are *plenty* of genuine attacks to list here - I would like to be able to show people an impeccable list of examples of hateful and violent speech directed at TERF's, but this kind of thing allows people to dismiss the whole subreddit"
691,Wait there’s Black Panther youth? :0 what do you do there? That’s pretty cool!
692,"Yep, true.

But is once a month posting something like it really so bad? OP posts a ton of other stuff that is relevant of TRAs actually dehumanizing us/calling us slurs."
693,Not terribly glamorous. I helped with the free breakfast program.
694,I didn't say it was ''bad'' - you can do what you like in your own subreddit - you can fill it with made up ''satire'' if you like - I'm only saying it weakens what *was* the original purpose of the subreddit
695,"I wasn’t implying that you actually sad it was “bad” — it’s the connotation, obviously. I’m just playing devil’s advocate and sticking up for OP. I’m also agreeing with you."
696,"I'm not attacking OP, but I can see how you might interpret my view as an attack which needs to be defended against.

You are not agreeing with me, you are defending against my view and supporting this kind of post - that is not agreeing with me, that is pretty much *disagreeing* with me, unless you are basically saying ''Yes I agree that this kind of post weakens the purpose of the subreddit but I think it should be allowed because there's nothing wrong with weakening the purpose of the subreddit''."
697,"I don’t think you’re attacking her at all — in fact, I hate the liberal use of the word “attack” because it sounds so dramatic and violent.

I’ve said I actually SEE your point and agree with you. Once again, I was playing devil’s advocate on OP’s part. I never said it SHOULD be allowed, I’m just using Socratic questioning to *ask* if it’s okay once in a while. That doesn’t mean I think it should be posted. 

I’m not supporting this kind of post. Calm down."
698,"You said you were ''sticking up for'' OP which implies that OP is under some kind of attack and needs to be defended.

You say you were ''asking'' if it should be allowed, but why would you even ask, if you didn't think it should be allowed? The very question suggests that you are defending that it should be allowed, as if I have said it shouldn't be, which I didn't.

Also I don't need to ''calm down'', and there is nothing to be gained by telling me to do so, unless your aim is to imply that I have lost control and become hysterical."
699,"You do need to calm down because you are getting overly defensive and making a huge deal out of nothing. I've explained myself a million times.

Not replying to this thread any longer. Jeez."

701,FEMINISM IS A TERF
702,[deleted]
703,"I really wish someone had this conversation with me when I was 12. I spent my young teenage years exposing myself to older men online and feeling so cool for it. I’m currently in an extremely toxic relationship with a man 30 years my senior. The damage I’ve caused myself is probably irreparable. I don’t feel empowered, I feel used and silly."
704,Lol implicitly this means that TiMs are predators.
705,I wish I’d had older and wiser women to help me to navigate the dating world when I was young and dumb(er). I’d have avoided several toxic relationships and probably wouldn’t have been sexually assaulted.
706,Kind of glad as it’s making the word lose its efficacy.
707,"I think perhaps the accusation of being 'terfs' wasn't based on that comment, but on previous comments not shown here - this looks like a grudge carried over from another conversation"
708,[removed]
709,We need this on a t-shirt!
710,"So is biology, reality, what else is a terf?"
711,Because you weren’t.
712,"Aww. I’m so sorry hun. I’m here if you need to talk, feel free to DM me. Also r/actualwomen is a great place for support too. 

Hope things get better, we are your sisters here and we have your back! You got this! You’re way stronger than you know. ♡"
713,You're not damaged and you can leave that relationship and be successful in life. I believe in you.
714,You are never damaged for being exploited.
715,"You aren't damaged. You're not ""irreparable."" It's never too late to start being kinder to yourself. Can you leave this relationship safely? You're too precious to waste any more time with this man."
716,They are
717,"tbh i've finally had this coalesce in my mind and i've been trying to bring it up at every opportunity. the \*mere engagement in trans identification\* is abusive because it is \*gaslighting\*. I have not seen \*one\* man in a dress who doesn't engage in the abusive factors of 1) denying reality (with the expectation that those he demands deny it as well) and 2) threatening violence (on himself or others) when or even just at the possibility that people don't comply with his demands of reality denial. (Threats to 't\*rfs' or 'transphobes' and threats to himself through threatening suicide or implying that not denying reality will force others to kill themselves.) 

&#x200B;

i now believe (and have seen no evidence otherwise) that these men who ""identify as women"" are unilaterally abusers, because at the bare minimum their gaslighting is abusive. with abuse comes predatory behavior, and thank you for saying this because i had not thought about that aspect of it too. the more time i spend here and on sister subs and read news articles (like the [recent win by a young man with pink hair to have unrestricted access to all the masturbatory aid he needed in the form of real live uncensored vulnerable teenage women](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/11/14/palatine-schaumburg-high-school-district-votes-to-give-transgeder-students-unrestricted-locker-room-access/)) the more i am convinced that every single one is a narcissistic abusive predator."
718,"I know that feeling and can SO relate, but please don’t blame yourself. On the plus side, at least we can warn other women now :) Especially younger ones. Let’s use that wisdom to protect other women <3 Even though it came at a shitty cost."
719,"So? I see this wayyyyyyy too much on tumblr. It’s ridiculous. People will call women “terfs” all the time in an attempt to disprove our points. It’s still just as bad. 

But honestly I have seen people calling this stuff terfy, especially when we talk about patriarchy. Because calling out patriarchy and men’s oppression of women is offensive to TIMs."
720,"Regardless of what the accusation was based on, reblogging that particular post with that kind of commentary is a shitty thing to do."
721,Happy cake day!
722,"Bye, dude."
723,You can always order custom shirt online. Let us hope they don't prevent the order to appease gender facists.

728,"Thank you. It’s hard for me to believe that I was exploited because I feel like I consented and willingly participated in everything that happened to me. Now that I’m slightly older, I am starting to think I was groomed. It’s hard to remember how it all started though because I was “dating” a 30 year old online before I even had my first period. I think I’ve blocked a lot of it out. 

Thank god it all stayed online until I was 18. I think I would’ve gone down a much darker path if that wasn’t the case."
729,"I’m planning on leaving him soon. I am in college with a very intensive class schedule. I’m waiting to leave him after I finish my final exams so that I don’t jeopardize my ability to study by being distraught/harassed by him. 

Thank you for saying all that. It means a lot to me."
730,This. They 100% are. They like being abusive males.
731,Thank you <3 You’re right
732,"So true. 

In addition because there are less boundaries between the communities they get really paranoid and start flagging any sort of woman centered content as ‘terf-y’. Too much of social faux pas for them to be caught anywhere near ‘terf’ content or people. 

It’s funny when the opposite happens — rad fems reblogging TRA or QT content. The notes on those posts are just hilarious. Rad fems acknowledge good posts regardless of the poster, so not only do TRAs / QT have to be careful about who they follow and what they reblog, they have to make sure their content doesn’t appeal to radical feminists either. 


But yes the witch hunts for ‘terfs’ on tumblr is a real thing."
733,This guy thinks trans males can gestate babies. Just an FYI. Seems to dislike actual feminists.
734,Because your title implied that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc - but I think the person who called them 'terfs' was very likely referring back to a previous discussion
735,You lost me - I don't know who you are criticising - the OP here or the commenter in the linked page ...?
736,[removed]
737,"It’d be cool if a GC feminist/radfem made these shirts and used the profits to help women, like donating to Vancouver Rape Relief or something. :)"
738,"You’re so sweet!!! You’re more awesome :) <3 

I was in radfem tumblr, and below these comments there were radfems/women calling him out. But I could only fit so much into a screenshot. 

Radfem tumblr is the best tumblr! So much wisdom there. & REALLY cool, smart, brilliant, hilarious women. It feels like a true sisterhood. Pretty inspiring actually. <3

(And yes, I’m happy to recommend some subs if you want!)"
739,"I'm so glad to hear that. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders. I wish you all the best, and I hope you ace your exams! <3"
740,"Wait, seriously? It’s a dude? Wow. 

Explains the fragile ego, the need to “correct” women, the incessant arguing, refusal to admit that he’s wrong and doesn’t know what he’s talking about, etc."
741,"At best, this makes the accusation of TERF foolish and strategically misguided. We don't know if there was prior context, but we *do* know that they chose to spin off the wording used in the previous comment."
742,Nah. Lol
743,The commenter in the linked page. It was a post about girls being taken advantage of. You’d have to be a special kind of asshole to derail that to point out a “terf”
744,You commented on my post. 😹😹 Thank you! That’s a compliment.
745,Looks that way. Posts on GenderCriticalGuys (gets almost no upvotes).
746,"Yes, but that's another issue. Are you disagreeing with anything I said?"
747,"You said: ""Mentioning anything about patriarchy, exploitation and trauma are ‘terfy’ now"" ... how is that *not* implying that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc?

You're denying what's right in front of you and laughing about it."
748,"Oh yes, of course it was inappropriate, but the point I was making was that the accusation of 'terf' probably wasn't based on those comments - and we already know that people who use 'terf' as a derogatory term wouldn't be interested in discussing anything about how to protect female people, so they probably didn't even think about the current discussion, only concerned about silencing 'terfs'"
749,[removed]
750,"Gee, I wonder why! What a loser lol. He should be banned from this subreddit. I reported the rude comments but maybe mods haven’t gotten to them yet 🤷‍♀️"
751,"Well, if we're splitting hairs, I disagree that it's ""very likely"" that this was in response to a previous comment.

More to the point, I do think that this part of the same issue - how do we have constructive conversations about complicated gender issues?"
752,"What exactly am I denying? I’m just disagreeing with you. 

Honestly, you’ve been very rude to me in the past and I would like to be done with this convo. I actually know how tumblr works and this stuff is all too common. Plus there are too many users on there for there to be people who remember users’ “prior terfy conversations” or whatever. Men call us terfs for being feminists. Period. 

Bye.

Edit: Apparently the person I'm talking to is a MALE! What a surprise. Dominating the conversation and telling women that we don't know what we're talking about. He should be banned. Mansplaining at its finest, and he has the audacity to call himself a feminist. Wow."
753,"Exactly, so that person is a trash gremlin regardless of what they were referencing. So it doesn't really matter."
754,"😹😹😹 We get it, you’re insecure and projecting because of your small penis. Bye."
755,"Do you really think it is at all likely that this person called them 'terfs' based solely on those comments, with no previous history between them?"
756,"You are denying that your title implies that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc.

Also, how ironic that you complain of people who judge current comments based on prior conversations, at the same time as you are doing that exact same thing to me - you are the one who is being rude here, and rude in the past - way ruder than I have ever been to you.

I disagree with things that you say, and call you out on your bad behaviour, and you interpret that as ''rudeness'' and use it as an excuse to be even more rude to me."
757,I think it does matter if OP is misrepresenting the situation
758,"Yes, because that is what these clownfish do. They label anything and everything terf because they cannot answer. Stop pretending you haven't seen this."
759,"That's a slightly different claim from the original one, but yes - I've seen TERF used in some pretty atrocious ways (e.g. ""I'm going to rape you, you fucking TERF"") so I wouldn't rule it out. Plus, this particular comment they were responding to was purposeful and well-written, and seemed to be the beginning of a new conversation - so it seems a non-sequiter for it to have been part of an ongoing (quite bitter) dialogue."
760,"I’m not denying it. My “Nah. Lol” was just dismissing what you were saying. 

I’m just saying I don’t have time to argue with you when you’ve been rude in the past. Move along. Blocking you because I don’t have time for this weird drama. Lol. And not sure what “bad behavior” you’re referencing. Pretty weird."
761,There's no actual evidence that the situation is being misrepresented though???
762,Actually I have never seen anyone called a 'terf' unless they have said something which suggests that they believe that male people cannot become female
763,I don't really understand your reasoning at all - I came to the opposite conclusion based on exactly the same perception that it was a new conversation and *therefore* inappropriate to be calling anyone 'terfs' in response to the subject matter - much more likely that the person calling them 'terfs' was referring to a different conversation
764,"OK, we'll see if you really do block me - perhaps that means I will be free to speak my views in future without you being rude and denying reality all over my comments eh"
765,"Not on the linked page, no, but I think it's very likely that the accusation of 'terf' was in reference to a previous encounter and not based on the shown comments"
766,Male people are male people. Not female. Males. Stop fucking colonizing us you sick bastards. I'm done playing nice with you creeps.
767,"That's because we're talking about two different scenarios. I'm saying this doesn't look like an out-of-context snippet of conversation, you're saying it does look like there is a background context to their relationship. Both could be true, or neither."
768,[deleted]
769,Holy shit. Shut up. You keep repeating this point and no one cares.
770,You think it’s very likely. Which means you have no actual evidence and all of the drama you’re causing about this is based on nothing but a hunch that nobody even cares about.

783,What's not surprising is that TRAs can't even empathize with the trauma a lot of women go through related to sexual assault and would use even that to attack us.
784,"""They were asking for it!"""
785,No its not surprising because men sexually assault women pretty regularly and talking about it does not equal bigotry. Lol how feminist and woke to use sexual assault against the victims as if it makes them unreliable narrators of their own experience. Seems mighty fucking familiar to me.

Ugh this 14 year old girl was just kidnapped and raped about a block from me 😑 she was walking to middle school. Then the guy went back for seconds like he was using the middle school as a friggin buffet. That girl got away and they got the guy. I hope he’s in jail for life because that’s not redeemable."

796,Males are defective.
797,Honestly I expect this sort of gross content from someone named *corpsegrinder*.
798,and yet we must bend and contort as to not make them feel any negative emotions
799,I feel like I say it a lot and that's because it's true too often but the transcult is a cult of narcissism. The only solution is separation and contact as minimally as possible.
800,Only if they spout the correct party line and suck girldick.
801,Our accounts of sexual assault are probably triggering for their dysphoria as they will never be raped like a woman.
802,... Very mature response he gave you !
803,I am in awe of this exchange
804,You worded that perfectly about why we need feminism and how it's about women not putting men first.  I really hope you reported that person.  Such an aggressive response isn't OK.
805,">discriminating against men is unfeminist 

Ah, yes. That totally real thing, systematic oppression of men for being male."
806,"I tried to balance you out, friend. 

What's funny to me, is even in the way they type and address you..I could call them out for being men. 

So aggressive and apt on pushing you down.

Try not to let is dishearten you. The movement is now being viewed in public, and quite frankly they don't look so good. Incels needed publicity to be addressed as a threat, this situation is no different."

Thanks for balancing me out, friend."
818,Are they? Because I was called that and instantly banned from a sub just a few days ago. At this point it feels like most subs are moderated by trans rights activists who will immediately ban anyone who has ever disagreed with their agenda.
819,LMAO. you ARE the patriarchy
820,It is almost always used in a context where the goal is to silence and degrade women. This is a prime example.
821,"My god I wish I hadn’t lol you interact with a lot of angry men who think if they tantrum enough it’ll make them a lady. This shit will crumble as quickly as it came it’s a matter of time.  

Bonus points for the dude that said being a woman and being biologically female are different things. They need the validation and buy-in of society to be “valid” where no matter what we just are. They wouldn’t do this if they weren’t living in a western country. Something tells me trans women don’t exist in places where girls and women are sold and traded like chattel."
822,"It's narcissists 101. You fight the good fight, which I respect. But sadly its fruitless. People in their position will never stop demanding, if we keep standing our ground. In the end we'll only be held accountable for being resilient, not a cluster of violent and aggressive men who identify as women."
823,"I’ve been permanently banned from several subs and I’ve only been here for a couple of months. The other day I posted a commented empathizing with a woman female or trans I don’t know) who said she had been sexually assaulted and wanted to know if others thought she should report the friend who attacked her. Others said to report her rapist. I was empathic and also said that if she didn’t report him he would go on to rape other women. I finished with something like “Think of your sisters”. 

Some trans person must have looked at my profile or recognized my Reddit name and screamed at me online about having no right to comment, I was a pretend feminist, etc. 

Unfuckingbelievable!  Nothing I said was particularly feminist. It was just one woman empathasizing with the suffering of another woman at the hands of a man who attacked her. One human being reaching out to comfort another. 

The person who reacted so badly to not being centered in that moment was a man larping as a woman and doing it badly because he failed Female Bonding 101. 

He’s a man because his rage at me was so disproportionate to my comment and to the tone of the comment (empathy and sisterly advice which the woman asked for). 

He’s a man because he immediately jumped to who owns feminism when that wasn’t the topic. 

He’s a man because if it isn’t about him he can’t be quiet or move along. 

He’s a man because maybe the topic of sexual assault, rape, and friends who are attackers hit to close to home so he had to derail the thread."

828,"I’ve been permanently banned and called a terf from several subs where I never posted, just because I participate here. I don’t give a shit, I’m not going anywhere. I’m too old to be intimidated by a bunch of narcissistic men dressed up as anime characters."
829,Damn. What is the world coming to when showing basic empathy provokes such a hateful response? I guess the TIMs know that any kind of sisterly bonding is a threat to his control.
830,2 whole days! However will he deal?
831,Your contempt and lack of empathy for women outs you as male. You will never be female.

862,do you know the artist who made this? I really like their style and I wanna see if they’ve done more gen crit work :~)

872,Well he's right - there is no place in the modern feminist movement for female people who don't submit to the male people who are now in charge of it
873,The liberal feminist ideal: A white male.
874,The fucking nerve of these stupid men.
875,Imagine knowing this guy irl. Insufferable.
876,"Whoes a good little ""male feminist"" with pronouns in his name? 

Who do they think they are lecturing to women what feminism should be?"
877,"Men can’t be feminists. They can support feminists, be an ally to feminists (preferably by leading by example in treating women with respect, being anti rape, etc), but the struggle is ours alone."
878,"Who handed out all the Women club cards to men? Where can I find the woman that okay’d   males to  dictate feminism?
What  happen to this movement?  Why do  these males  think this is remotely acceptable? 
All was good when I left activism  in 2012, back when everyone knew what a woman was  and we had men starting to  try to be decent people ... but look where we are now? 
Men such as these should be receiving a verbal smackdown to remind them of their place before Our foremothers roll out of their graves in contempt for whatever this is going on because this male is not a feminist. 
Also:They call us trans exclusionary but fail to realize we aren’t excluding trans men (AFABs), we exclude males and  the LadyDique owners  because males have no place in feminism outside of  standing in solidarity with us and being allys.

I know a dude personally that started and runs well over 300 subreddits (not much gender related stuff).

He's an oddball with a big internet presence, but is a weak poor man IRL. He also operates on other websites, he has no life outside of his preaching and online activism.

MtF dudes vs women in sports doesn't fly in any of Reddit's regular sports related subs, you can see that. Unlike a lot of Reddit subs, they're not modded by propagandists censoring away dissent."
883,"It's because women started trying to placate men by saying that feminism can help them too, by discouraging the enforcement of gender stereotypes. Then men started saying they were feminist allies, and women cheered them on, thinking, ""Finally, some of them get it and care about us!"" That led to men calling themselves feminists, and women included them because that's how we're socialized. And now, in traditional male fashion, they have taken over and think they're doing it better."

Edit: Wait, at least four. 

Edit: five."
885,"You don’t say! Men? Taking something over and claiming ownership of it?

That's how they can twist this crappy theory to say GC are white supremacist because queer theorists queer the system so anyone who stops that is supporting the system. This is why it's pointless people arguing that GC can't be white supremacists because we're diverse and anti racist because it's all actually logical through critical race theory.

998,Proof that you can’t identify out of the oppressor class.
999,No slurs.
1000,"This recent scientific article explains the current knowledge of gender dysphoria*. GD is a minor brain abnormality that changes the self identity and anxiety while most of the brain is like usual for the natal sex. Thus it's not surprising that it's the MTF population that are causing most of the problems while we hardly hear anything from the FTM population despite the fast growth caused by the ROGD epidemic. 

The paraphilic/AGP subpopulation of male GD is likely the most common offender because of their abnormal sexual drive. We've seen this with JY and other famous cases where multiple paraphilias overlap within the same individual. It's sad to see it has become taboo to talk about abnormal sexualities. Sexuality is by no means an area devoid of pathological behaviours. On the contrary, the intense sexual urge (especially for men) can cause a wide range of pathological/perverse/paraphilic behaviours.

This level of high excitement at the idea of extreme, intimate torture makes them feel nothing less than orgasmic... because now is it not only socially tolerated, it’s actively encouraged.

They consider it the same thing as simply calling out Nazis, but 1) I’ve never seen T*RFS advocate genocide, just insist that the biological reality of binary sex exists 2) I’ve seen extremely violent TRA protesters holding barbed wire bats, holding up female dolls hanging from nooses, making shoddy, homemade guillotines... in groups they give off this threatening vibe that they revel in because all of it is considered socially acceptable."

1056, Too bad you can't validate a vagina. Penis Officus!
1057,Psst...that guy's male socialization is showing.
1058,"This is an ad hominem, so it’s literally invalid 😂😂😂 they don’t realize how dumb they look when their only retort is “ur a TERF”."
1059,"""Your wrong because I said so Terv""

""You're nothing more than an Alt Right fake account user. But still a transphobic Terv""

""All Tervs are incels.""

""The Terv Movement is being financed by Conservatives. Just look at WolF.""

""Tervs on GC aren't even feminist though. They are all just straight men.""

""Tervs are UGLY incels and just jealous of Trans women's feminnnnmnnnity""

""Tervs are anti feminist and most are Political Lesbians who don't actually care about Lesbians.""

""Tervs are biological essentialist. Stop reading from your 4th grade biology book.""

""Tervs believe binary sexes exist. But what about Intersex people Tervs! It's not real at all but a social construct; but also a SpEctRum.""

""Tervs believe sex in binary, they continue to participate in and hold up Patriarichal Racist Colonialism.

""The reason why Tervs obsess about our Genitals, is because they are trying to suppress their desire for us.""

1066,Lmao they live on the internet

Okay and? Imma still say it. The fuck. 😂

Anyways, I should've replied with my default ""Don't care, didn't ask plus you're a male"""
1068,"Yet here you are in a sub full of delusional women with no direction in life thinking you're sane and that your perspectives are validated by your frivolous echo chamber. Yiiikes.

Well I take back the women part. You're all more than likely a bunch of fat, malding, Nazi dudes LARPing as women; though, the sentiment is still the same, regardless of gender."
1069,"Wait wait, ""stop reading your 4th grade biology book""? So they're admitting they are ignoring basic biology? I mean,I take this a win."
1070,"Strong projections, all of them"
1071,Down vote for the 'Okay boomer' :P other than that up vote.
1072,"It depends. Not everybody's definition of Gender Critical is the same, but for me, Gender Critical is about how patriarchy rules almost everything in society. Women are undercut, underpaid, undervalued and gender critical takes a look at that and *criticizes* it. 

Some people that are Gender Critical are not against trans people, some people are. But the gender critical society doesn't hate trans people for being trans, it's for being males and trying to demonize women a la calling them T*RFs and silencing the female perspective because it's ""only fair"" when usually it's not. 

Calling a female a ""menstruater"" or ""vagina haver"" while referring to all trans women as ""real women"" is 100% what GC is against. 

Not only that, but stereotyping women to an extreme and then calling yourself a woman, again, is shameful against women. 

Using misogyny while considering yourself a ""woman"" is, you guessed it, shameful. 

So while it seems hateful, it's more frustration that gender is so wholly valued over sex, which is REAL. 

Trans women that try to claim female issues like ovarian cancer, PCOS, PMS, ""menstruation symptoms""... and then suing or publicly shaming anybody that tells them otherwise is... just sick in the head.

Like I said, it varies though, person to person, and calling anyone who doesn't align with your patriarchal internalization a T*RF is pretty fucking stupid."
1073,"Well since they constantly need to be told that they are Valid™, it is an insult.

To them."
1074,"Oh look, more inaccurate insults!"
1075,"Imagine being this out of touch lol. Or rather forcing yourself to believe something so hard. I'm a 19 year old woman renting out my own place with a fulfilling career. You're the one going out of your way to ""insult"" (in quotes because no one is actually insulted by claims that are so wildly untrue) some women in a radfem sub lol."
1076,"Basic will still remain true. There have been more complexities discovered in the creation of the boys and girls sex and genitals: there exist 25 genes across the 46 chromosomes that facilitate this development. But at the end of the day despite new information, humans still are binary sexed mammals; with a small percentage 1.7% having a spectrum of Intersex conditions.

All of this biological incoherence has been based on the ""inside baseball"" of geneticist.

No they still believe sex is a social construct."
1077,I think these are the rotation of their talking points.
1078,"So, can trans people exist in your ideal world?"
1079,Oh they're plenty accurate. :(
1080,"Definetly, theyre just projections. Like this one especially...
>""Tervs on GC aren't even feminist though. They are all just straight men."""
1081,"Well, not really. Sure, there could be trolls here. You have found your way here and others can too. 

But I understand it's easier to believe we're evil Nazi men and to attack that image of us instead of believing that many are just regular women. I'm certainly not a Nazi, nor am I balding or fat. Neither are most here."
1082,"Also thinking Tervs desire them. We've been saying NO officially for 8 years now. Cotton Ceiling 8th anniversary was March 12th, 2020."
1083,"Yeah i think its part of the narcicissm. Its literally inconceivable to them that a reality exists which they dont like, so they construct an elaborate fantasy. ""They're actually jealous of our amazing femininity, girlcock, blah la."" Or ""im a woman inside"". Same basic principals :P"
1084,It's just a blur of nonsense.
1085,"The more rich celebrities that tweet the word ""TERF"" is just thousands more normal people googling it and understanding what it means.

1087,Pity he doesn't have the sense to bust the myth that men can be women.  It wouldn't be hard.

1093,"Yeah, because women\\terfs are so powerful we can ""peel"" away the trans. These people are legit fucked. The most nasty vile misogynists I have ever encountered. They have all the power. Obviously. Nothing says power like the ability to silence, ban and censor any criticism. To change the very definition of an entire class of people against their will. Yeah, poor fucking psychotic trans bastards. So oppressed."

Do you think people should be free to say “I don’t want to sleep with someone who has a penis/vagina”? Congratulations, you’re a terf. I have a hunch that many many people don’t even realize they would get labeled terfs as well if they had to have their views actually put to the test. But straight white men are not the targets and never will be."

1104,"The 'T' should be dropped tho, Gender identity =/= sexuality"
1105,"Actually the only reason I sorta support that is because gender and sexuality are two completely different things. Not because I’m “transphobic”.

1107,I've never heard of anybody saying LGB. I call bullshit. So called TERFS are almost never against transgender people. Strawman!
1108,Yeah i used to think he was awesome. But now i just think he’s sad for joining with other men to trample on women. The mythbusters glory days are already long gone but he did do some awesome episodes back in the day. Lets hope Jamie stays normal.
1109,"Exactly. I’d personally like to thank Contrapoints for the Gender Critical video. The content didn’t sit well with me, and I finally took some initiative to understand what a TERF _actually_ is, and that is the sole reason I ended up on the GC sub. Thanks for helping me reach peak trans Contrapoints, and finding my gender critical tribe."
1110,If he did he would have angry trans deplatform him for wrongthink
1111,"I honestly think it’s just people *trying* to be good people but just lacking understanding. 

I think the vast majority are people who are still a couple steps behind trans rhetoric, people who think trans people are just gay men living with crippling dysphoria and just trying to get on with life. 

I think another large chunk are people who ""don’t understand it"" and think that because it doesn’t make sense to them it must be intellectually above their heads and therefore super smart and enlightened and deferring to the loudest people is correct and deferring to the ""marginalized"" is woke and a harmless (to them) and easy way to ""be a good person"". To them bigots reject what they don’t understand so the logic must be that good people accept what they don’t understand"
1112,I hope it’s the first because i used to love mythbusters. But because of that i also think he probably isnt stupid. So i guess that leaves ‘hate women’ sadly
1113,"Holy fuck. What exactly do they want? All their allies are ""no doubt"" secretly ""TERF""s? If you say you support them they'll always think you're lying until you post a sex tape of you fucking a trans person?

No other group of people lives with such an insanely high level of paranoia at all times."
1114,They say transition isn’t a fetish and it isnt sexually motivated  yet having sex with them is the only real way prove yourself an ally 🤔
1115,"Well, they have a point.  If he thinks TIMs are women, why shouldn't he be every bit as willing to date and fuck them as natal women?"
1116,Christ. Even being an ally isnt enough anymore. Oh well
1117,"That's a gender critical woman, not a TRA actually wanting men to have sex with TIMs"
1118,"The tweet was right about one thing -- they cling onto LGB because they know that T, without L, G & B, wouldn't be given a second thought. Because these same-sex attraction rights were won for and BY lesbians, gay men and bisexuals.

&#x200B;

\*\*in here before some TRA tries to use handpicked, debunked claims of ""uhhhhhh ahcktually trans people won all the gay rights for you you're welcome uwu"" because if trans people actually DID achieve all those civil rights victories, then they should have had no problem fighting for their **own** acceptance without needing to hide behind the LGB shield and pretend same-sex love is AT ALL similar to dress-up"

Besides, nobody who says that commits violence against trans people. Violence is mainly from men who have problems with dating trans, not women.

1228,"Pissing on graves; so stunning and progressive. 

I genuinely don’t understand all the women there who can look at that and think ‘haha yeah, kill those other women who don’t agree with me’. WTF!"
1229,"It’s interesting to see the number of people that support violent acts on women, and quite scary."
1230,"What they mean by “transphobia” is “women fearing men”. We’re not afraid of transmen. They’re females and they’re not invading anyone’s space. They automatically benefit from male privilege. So, it’s you, fucking men, that we’re fighting, and not “transgenders”."
1231,"If we were anything like them we'd piss on that sign and then threaten everyone there with violence and murder. Maybe chest bump some girls and punch an old lady in the face. Oh, wait..."
1232,If I hadn't peaked already this would make me.
1233,"""Piss on the graves of women who don't want our girldick! Yeah! Just like real women would do! This isn't male behavior or thinking at all!"""
1234,Taken at this event - https://philevents.org/event/show/74566
1235,so they're literally proclaiming that they'll kill us in our bathrooms? weird flex but ok.
1236,ONLY MEN ARE THIS FUCKING VIOLENT
1237,What a shit show
1238,"When you think about it TIMs are kind of clever, in a twisted way. They're men who've found a way of getting away with making disgusting violent threats against women. A man wants to be able to punch women without looking bad? Now he can just call himself a woman and it's totally acceptable!"
1239,"This shit is freaking me out to the point that I don't trust my own mind anymore.  Like, I can't tell if these sentiments are actually common and dominant, or if it's some kind of Baader-Meinhof scenario.  These signs seem like some kind of fuck you thing that I would have found edgy as a young teenager, but ostensibly are produced by adults?  And taken seriously?  And other intelligent adults (aka us) now have to be terrified of these morons because of the weird power they've seized?  Can somebody give me some kind of a reality check on all of this?"
1240,"These intimidation tactics are beyond pathetic. More and more people will awaken to how they are centering women in their hate campaigns. People don’t know what terf means, but they can use google and find out. Keep it up, boys. Show that pent up male aggression. Keep doing our work for us. We will just keep documenting for whenever someone is ready to peak."
1241,Just goes to show how people put male pride on such a high pedestal that they think death threats are an appropriate response to it.
1242,"It's insanity, that's what. They'll go along with what their group says without really understanding the implications, or even wanting to."
1243,This is what they do get.  I am not afraid of TIMs who are cross dressing the privacy of their home.  I am afraid of men in the women's bathroom.  It's a legitimate safety issue and a legitimate fear.
1244,What was the purpose of this protest?
1245,I think they mean they will piss and shit on our graves. (That'll be amusing for my kids when they come to leave flowers (way in the future I hope). Teach them to have a terf for a mother.)
1246,"Also- only men piss on things. I mean, because of our anatomy (and socialization) women pissing on things isn’t really a thing. I don’t know, the whole “we’ll piss on you!”thing seems like (beyond the violent nature of it) such little boy behavior"
1247,Protesting the event.
1248,But why and to what end?
1249,"To stop people asking provocative questions, I guess."
1250,Please report these messages to reddit admin and don't give trolls attention.
1251,He did nothing wrong by demanding the lady place waxed his tiny bitchass balls
1252,I refuse to believe it's not a troll. I think even TRAs seem not to like Yaniv actions.
1253,I just got the same message! These people need to get a life and quit trolling.
1254,"**Report this** to the admins using the ""contact us"" link at the bottom of each page."
1255,Lmao I got it too. Some people have far too much free time.
1256,I’ve never mentioned Yaniv and received this too
1257,I got it too. I just reported it😂
1258,I got that too!
1259,This is from Yaniv lol
1260,"Oh hey, I'm in the club! I got it, too."
1261,Got it too. I'm not even that active. 🤣
1262,Lol i thought even the TIMs had disavowed him
1263,Honestly afraid of the future as we now have a movement legitimately defending pedophiles

1265,"This reminds me of the ""Hitler did nothing wrong"" meme."
1266,"I thought TRAs already abandoned Yaniv and have stopped defending him to people because of his grooming behavior, harassment, and assault of strangers and children. Maybe this guy didn't get the memo or is a time traveler from 2018 where everyone was still kissing his ass and you would be banned from reddit, 4chan, and other forums for ""deadnaming"" him hahaha"
1267,newbie here! what does KYS mean?!
1268,And showing his gross racism in the process
1269,"Yeah a lot of the community don't agree with him. 

Lol maybe it's actually him"
1270,This is probably Yaniv himself tbh
1271,"I will, though they seem to have made an account just today for the purpose of spamming this message to me (and others? they seem to have posted the same text as a post on /r/GC?) - their account cakeday is today, and they have 1 karma.

Edit: yeah there's a post on GC now where other radfems say they got the same message. Imagine being such a loser that you spend your Saturday making troll accounts to tell women to commit suicide."
1272,"I know, right? That plus the yaniv reference made me wonder if they were actually pro-trans or just trolling but, either way they sent it to dozens (hundreds?) of GC women with ""KYS"" in it."
1273,"Internet slang for ""kill your self""

Welcome, by the way!"
1274,Oo what a treat lol
1275,"The same thing happened all over Reddit earlier this week. It' important to let the admins know this is going on, even if they never manage to figure out how to stop brand new accounts from blitzing a whole lot of DMs and then disappearing."
1276,I got the same msg! I feel weirdly accomplished
1277,"oh right! lovely!

thanks! discovered this was an actual subreddit after being called a TERF for the first time today! Am only semi-new to the whole Gender Critical thing though and everything makes so much sense (which is infuriating because how do the general public not know about this?!?!?)

1279,"on the contrary, covid-19 has gone wild on men in italy.. and i bet you it can't distinguish between men and men taking exogenous estrogen either :)"
1280,"hope covid-19 takes down a substantial amount of

~~rapists~~

~~murderers~~

~~child abusers~~

~~sex traffickers~~

~~endangered animal poachers~~

~~Nazis~~

~~people who kill trans people~~

**women who disagree with men co-opting their spaces and life experiences**

Makes total fucking sense, right? Fuck women with opinions, they’re literally worse than rapists."
1281,"They don’t talk like this about racists, or misogynists, etc. it’s because deep down, they know their identity isn’t real. They have to be extreme and violent about this at all times, or the doubts will creep back into their heads. They overcompensate."
1282,Hoping women suffer and die of a horrible disease is okay @becausetrans
1283,"Funny, isn’t it currently 70 % male fatality rate? Men die quicker, women get sicker. We are built to withstand illness and disease in order to be able to keep kids alive. Men are expendable much of the time, and it shows."
1284,"why do they keep saying this when we know it primarily infects men. i mean, pandemic harm women the most no matter what because of the effects on the economy, familial structures and strain, etc. but its so stupid to say something like this lmao. virus' don't care about your politics"
1285,Shame that men are more susceptible!
1286,Imagine the worldwide screem if someone said 'i hope covid 19 takes down a substantial amount of trans people'
1287,"They are being truly dramatic. It's always Shakespearean- lite: ""For Tervs and Swervs, a plague on both your houses.

They just can't see how riDICKulous they truly are."
1288,Jokes on them cause covid 19 dosn't care about their gender ID and its killing more men than women. (women person born female)
1289,"They literally called the virus transphobic because their ""essential to live"" reassignment surgeries were postpones"
1290,"Nice Shakespeare!

&#x200B;

also:

A plague upon you! A plague upon your cow!"
1291,I’ve read that men are getting sicker and dying at higher rates than women. I’m sure covid-19 respects gender identity. Given how many of these idiots smoke (WHILE ON HORMONES NO LESS) It’s safe to say their “concern” is misplaced.
1292,Lol it's not killing young women
1293,They won’t tolerate your opinions. No. They want you and everyone you love to die a terrible death.
1294,"Sorry dude. Yeah you, transwoman dude. Covid-19 takes down more men than women. Covid-19 is a TERF."
1295,Hah! Good one
1296,"Ooh, how dya say ""clap back"" in Italian? 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"
1297,A lot of transpeople are killed by other transpeople. Domestic violence.
1298,"Not to inject personal shit into this but, I struggle a lot with feeling like my mental illnesses are valid. But I don't look for validation by attacking people. It's okay to be confused and struggle with your identity but it's makes me angry to see these people (because a lot of TRAs do this too) are so violent about it."
1299,"They don't really think. They're just morons who hate women. I can't even imagine getting to the point where I said something like this with a slur for them substituted. As much as I really do dislike them, hoping for any group of people to actually get sick and die is horrible."
1300,"We can say it, just not publicly."

1305,Hey at least he came right out and said it.
1306,He does seem to recognize that he's using a slur since he *'d it.
1307,"This is what sexual frustration looks like on perverts. They will never be, or have real lesbians. They need to get over it."
1308,"It’s quite telling that these men think lesbian = terf. Their hatred for women is so disturbing, especially when you consider how much they want to wear our skin."
1309,I’m tired of them thinking I’m offended by the word terf. Yes I exclude men from my dating pool. That’s what being a lesbian is. Call it whatever you want it doesn’t give their tantrums any validity.
1310,And this is why the tras are lesbophobic
1311,Why is everyone in the comments assuming they're a man? I see this as a very AFAB nonbinary comment to make.
1312,They're mad 'cause we don't want their dicks.
1313,No. Words.
1314,"No I think they \*'d it so their tweet can't be shown when searching for the word terf. Because, you know, radfems are bullies who search the word terf so they can harass you (and not the other way around)"
1315,"Everyday Eggs get cracked in egg_irl, and more Transbians are created. It's never going to stop."
1316,>Goodbye Horses intensifies
1317,Because Twitter is cracking down on the the T*rf word.
1318,"Really? Tell me if I’m being to optimistic... Don’t you think these perverts at some point will see they will never get lesbians, and they will never be seen as real women. So at some point they have to catch on, and think it’s just not worth it. I mean even if this generation doesn’t, the younger generations have to be watching and learning. Once they notice that they (transbians) are just seen as perverts and have zero respect or credibility perhaps they won’t want to be seen that way as well. It’s like carrying a sign saying I’m a lesbian fetishist. I lurk on MTF sometimes, and I’ve seen quite a few posts lately (over the last 4 months?) from them. The posts are basically about being depressed over being seen as fetishist, or asking how they’ll know if it’s just a fetish, because they don’t want to be a fetishist. Don’t you think that will grow? Is it just my wishful thinking?"
1319,"I don’t mean to offend but do you think pervs will wake up one day and say “ah, i’m done with the perv thing”? Of course they won’t. 

They might get discredited in as much as white guys driving white vans with no sign on them got discredited over time, but they won’t stop shaming and gaslighting women (even if they only get to do it to their mothers and possible wives). 

Mental illness when untreated only tends to become harder. Fetishes and kinks only tend to get more specific and weirder. Without proper care, by which i mean no pumping hormones and no social validation, but long hours in session to figure out how to change bad behavior and whatever therapy doctors might find that can help in the future (once they start doing their jobs of CARING for patients anyway) might help. 

I have no hope for men to just snap out of it. Don’t think you should either."
1320,"Wishful thinking. Ultimately they will be corrected by others on the thread. They have to continue to reinforce:

Trans women are women and female. If this is false, it becomes an existential Crisis."
1321,"Not that they would stop being a pervert, but that they would hide it out of shame. I guess I expect dignity from men trying to rape lesbians, and that’s not a good use of time."

1335,I guess it makes sense since she thinks she's a man and trans rights are men's rights.
1336,Dang she really be cravin' that male approval.
1337,"Wow she's so brave and masculine! Sitting on her arse trolling women online. Yeah, I'm sure all the greatest revolutionaries liberated the oppressed that same way. And of course the TiMs will love and respect her as A Real Man, now. They'll be ever so appreciative of her gallant, manly efforts, tapping away on a keyboard to guard the collective honour of their Lady-Genders. /s"
1338,"Just imagine the backlash if we did what they do. If we went into their subs saying ""kill them all"". 
Can't they not see how fucked up doing that is?"
1339,[removed]
1340,"Exactly. There was one person in the meme comments who checked her posts and was like, ""you told people to go die, that's not good"" and they got downvoted lol"
1341,Also I was informed by lgb drop the T is actually run by trans people.
1342,"True. She really thinks this makes her some hero 😂 

The funniest part to me is that she was complaining about how ""rude"" everyone replying to her was....after she posted threats of death, told people to kill themselves, and said people should fuck off. Truly a big brain moment."
1343,"As an actual 14 year old, I can assure you that calling people simply gross without stating why, or at least trying to be mature, is on a 9 year old's level."
1344,"Exactly. Imagine if gay rights activists or civil rights activists had just told people to kill themselves instead of actual activism, lmao."
1345,"Nothing important, not in the least because 75% of them are actual children."
1346,"Lmao, adorable. Someone's projecting realllllllly hard.

I'll fight for women's rights until my dying day. The right of female assembly, to have our own spaces, to have restrooms we feel safe in, to talk about our biology and our problems, and to define our own community. And you know one thing I know about feminism? It's never been popular. The cool, not-like-other-girls have never been feminists. But feminists always win in the end. 😊"
1347,Not hard. It's per usual.
1348,"yes, it's ok to tell us to go die, and all the while we're ""LitErAllY kILLinG THeM"" with our words."
1349,"People on the sub were celebrating her saying ""KILL ALL TERFS"" and ""GO DIE"" but if I say ""you're born a female and will die a female"" I'm violent and dangerous LMAO"

You don’t have any screengrabs of the comments, do you? 🙏"
1351,"I do! Tho uploading them to imgur will take a bit

Edit: comments from the meme post: 

http://imgur.com/a/eAUaxTd

One of the commenters even admits to going through her comments and upvoting the abuse, so it's not even like ""they didn't know"" she was just telling people to die/threatening to kill them."

I want to write an article about it, how it is a perfectly distilled example of what we have been talking about all along

1358,And your gender identity has NOTHING to do with other people's sexuality.
1359,Holding up a sign makes them feel unsafe? How precious. Feeling attacked because someone doesn't want to fuck them is ridiculous.
1360,"An obvious truth: lesbians don’t have a penis. 

Women don’t have a penis.

Trans people: working hard every day and in every way, to erase our biology."
1361,"""penis exclusionary""

LMAO everything is ""X exclusionary"" to them

We should start calling them ""logic exclusionary"""
1362,"These people have messsssssy disaster minds. Nothing they say is consistent or logical. They are fixated on genitals and using that word as often as possible. Constantly in conversation, forcing their genitals into your mind like they want to do to your pants. Gender roles should not dictate a damn thing to anyone. They have nothing to do with anything except their own personal LARP and sexism. That is their business.  Many people in the community are GNC, and that used to be celebrated (at, you know...PRIDE). Now women need to know their place again. To be quiet and let the trans women dictate when autonomy is appropriate, or else."
1363,How are lesbians a danger to trans people? It's the other way around.
1364,Penis exclusionary lesbians would have been an oxymoron until recently. It makes me laugh just reading it. These people promote free sexuality and “boundaries” so much but you aren’t allowed to say that there’s a group of females out there who don’t want to be penetrated by a penis. Insane. No one is bugging gay men or “straight” trans women for not wanting to have sex with a “vagina haver”.
1365,"This has reached astronomically levels of ignorance and entitlement. Lesbians are not long safe within the movement, we for sure need to gtfo"
1366,No lesbian wants dick. Your genitals absolutely matter when you're having sex and to say otherwise is to fundamentally misunderstand something as simple as fucking.
1367,Penis exclusionary lesbian is redundant.
1368,"Jesus. I haven't confronted a lifelong of scorn and hate for someone's identity. I've done it for their sex. 

Their bodies, their genitals. And all the beautiful personalies and characters that tack onto that. 

Lesbian is not about your fucking feelings."
1369,"I can't even believe that ""Penis exclusionary lesbians""  is an actual thing to be upset about. Duh, lesbians dont want your man dick."
1370,"“The police need to keep trans women safe”

From what? Paint fumes from her sign?"
1371,Because holding a sign is obviously a danger to trans people. How could they possibly survive if they got their little feelies hurt? These poor people.
1372,Not wanting to have sex with someone is literal violence apparently
1373,"I would not be surprised if they will start to claim that marriage excludes them from having sex with wives. 

Sex is between consenting adults. There's no consent if people (especially women) can't reject offers. Exclusion is by far more important than inclusion in the domain of sexual intercourse."
1374,Lesbian isn't a SEXuality anymore didn't you know /s

You've really hit the nail on the head here, and why the growing public obsession with gender makes me so uneasy. Particularly with regards to minors."
1382,Obviously. I am definitely not homoSEXual because I do not want to have SEX with members of the opposite SEX.
1383,"""TERF's"" aren't even feminists anymore by their definition, of course they would try and redefine lesbian to exclude more women"
1384,">> used to include TIMs and women of colour

Nonwhite women were already included..."
1385,"> Womxn is supposed to be a more ""inclusive"" term used to include TIMs and women of colour.

The TRA constantly try to wrap themselves in the cloak of other social movements that fought for justice. For example, glomming on to the success of the gay and lesbian rights movements. They also do that with racism. By making a new fake definition of the word ""woman"" that lumps TIMs and non-white women together, they get to pretend that anyone who is gender critical is a racist."
1386,">I am sure this male thinks he is ""more of a woman"" than real lesbians.

""There are two types of women -- cis women and real women."" -- TIMs"
1387,"Honestly this pisses me off, the term woman includes all women, I don’t see why they even need to change it.

Shit I use “folk” all the time and have had folk give me a hard time for not spelling it as “folx”. I’m a Scottish Highlander, I speak Gaelic, English and Doric. Folk is used in Doric all the time and is a gender neutral term akin to “y’all”, and I’ve had to fight folk with “please stop telling me I can’t use one of my languages just to appease random internet strangers.”

It’s just dumb."
1388,"It makes no sense to me, but that is the definition. Contradictions are plentiful in the TRA world."
1389,The tans lobby likes to act like the womanhood of women of color is up for discussion too therefore they should support the blokes LARPing as women. They're using WOC as pawns.
1390,[removed]
1391,"I mean we are just born women, they on the other hand have *earned* the title."
1392,"I was reported when I was on AL for calling people ""folks"" ""buddy"" and ""fella."" The word policing is absurd and the rules change all the time based on who you are talking to, its impossible to keep up

Fellow Scot here, these absurd gender semantics can pòg mo thòin"
1393,I haven't found that gender critical white women are more racist than other white women are.
1394,By putting on a wig and a dress. Brave /s
1395,"It’s ridiculous ain’t it? I use “folk”, “pal”, “mate” all the time, get policed for my language. I dunno why this sorta of woke culture has come about where you police someone else’s language, but it’s dumb as fuck.

And they absolutely can pòg mo thòin as well!"
1396,And I haven’t said that they are more racist than other white women. You make it sound as if you believe they are less so though.
1397,[removed]
1398,Racism keeps feminism pure? What are you on about? You're the only person I've ever heard say something like that. Sounds like you are trolling.
1399,"It's Racist, but it's not about Purity. They claim it's divisive. If all women would work on breaking the back of White Supremacist Patriarichy all women would benefit.

They are suggesting nothing less than ""Trickle Down"" Liberation for non White women.

This has been the stance for over 60 years. It's why Black Radical Feminists made a break from them in the first place."
1400,[removed]
1401,"When I have encountered it, it is always framed as being about not diluting feminism with concerns for men, that refusing to address racism in the lives of women is a principled stance. Either way, though, the implication is that nonwhite women have to wait until after white women get what they want for a feminism that will address their issues."
1402,"I've seen none of that among gender critical women, and it sounds an awful lot like you want to *smear* GC as being inherently racist, and therefore worthy of being lumped in with alt-right, white supremacists and other dangerous people."
1403,Each generation experience it's own version of it.
1404,"Well, keep your eye out. If you do, you’ll see it. 

I’m not interested in making gender critical women out to be anything they aren’t. The white ones are racist, to the same extent as the non gender critical ones, as you yourself pointed out."
1405,"Rancid fuckholes? That's some stellar projection right there, Mr.  ""Neo-vagina""."
1406,"Not like I expect from a group of men that think the only function of a vagina is sex. So gross, I hate them."
1407,Vile
1408,"I know it’s anecdotal, but I swear I’ve never heard a woman call herself or any other woman a hole or fuckhole... unless, like, it was porn and she was trying to turn on the man. But never in just conversation as much as men do it. And most the time I swear I hear it just from incels."
1409,"Oh, and by the way, this wasn't even in a trans-related sub. It was in r/starterpacks. The topic came up because people were talking about J.K Rowling in the comments, and this TIM came in and started saying ""she's a TERF tho :'("". Someone else joined in and called us ""cunts"". Totally not misogynists, though. /s"
1410,There it is.
1411,Beautiful.
1412,"Funny, I’ve never had my vag get an ingrown hair ball or had it start to pop out, I don’t know if my TIM friends could say the same....

Weird how my fuckhole can create life and actually do something besides just be an open wound🤷‍♀️"
1413,I've seen it posted by TiFs in astonishing displays of internalized misogyny
1414,I went and found the thread...it made me want to tear my teeth out.
1415,"I saw that on the antinatalist sub. A TIF called herself a ""fucktoy and incubator"". I thought it was incredibly sad."

While ""TERF"" is supposed to stand for ""Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist,"" the people called ""TERF"" generally are neither radical feminists nor ""trans exclusionary,"" and in practice the term has become a slur. [More info.](https://redd.it/70cyzm)

1423,"I literally saw this same joke 10 years ago but instead of TERFs it just said ""feminists""

Says a lot."
1424,Oh wow men who want women to be quiet how brave and stunning how revolutionary
1425,This was allowed in a makeup sub? Oh handmaidens you never disappoint.
1426,That sub is such a man infested shithole.
1427,"We all ought to know by now any sub geared towards ""traditional"" women's interests was taken over a long time ago by penises desperate for attention.

Even your everyday users of makeup/skin/fashion/nail polish subs have complained because being male/trans/non-binary guarantees ridiculous amounts of upvotes over ""regular"" content posted by ""regular"" users. It winds up burying posts looking for legitimate feedback under those who just want to be people to drool over them for having the *audacity* to post. Honestly, I'm surprised this particular kind of post isn't more prevalent in sub like that...but maybe posting this sort of thing in a literal circlejerk subreddit is being just a little *too* transparent about their intentions.

Makeup is patriarchal bullshit, anyway."
1428,Post one of the similar cartoons that were printed about the suffragettes. Some nonsense a century on. Men are very unimaginative.
1429,"This is so odd. I saw this post come out of nowhere earlier today. I thought it would be downvoted or removed because of the whole silencing women thing, but everyone went along with it. One of the comments said that this should be JK Rowling's new lip gloss... This is honestly so disheartening. Why do all these makeup subs think you're some kind of evil nazi just because you don't agree with TRAs on everything?"
1430,"Telling women to shut up... how original. It’s not like men have been saying this very same thing about outspoken women for *literally all of human history* or anything. 

It’s amazing. We make up more than half the population, we are able to carry life inside of us and bring it in to the world, we raise the children that become the leaders of tomorrow... yet blatant fucking misogyny and silencing women like this is still supported and propagated in 2020, **BY WOMEN** as well as men. It just goes to show how far some women have internalized the hate men show us. It’s a sick sad world."
1431,"I've noticed these sorts of posts showing up in completely different and unrelated subs and they all go about it the same way.

Someone can go on a whole rant about TERFs or share their entire trans life story and as long as they make sure to add a tiny element of the sub they're posting in, the mods can turn a blind eye because they're not technically breaking the ""must be related to the sub"" and ""no politics"" rules."
1432,"Yup, you can still find the exact same picture but with ""feminists"" instead if you Google it. It was shared on reddit as recently as last year. 

They are so fucking transparent."
1433,A mod is reminding people that one of the rules in that sub prohibits discriminatory behavior. This is directed at anyone who doesn’t like that meme. I’m so stunned by the bravery that I just can’t.
1434,The group think is strong with these ones.
1435,"But imagine if the opposite happened and a TERF dared to post something similar about trans people, itd be removed and down voted to - 458285 before you could even blink. Sad part it's mainly women backing this utter bullshit too, not grasping how they're fucking themselves over in the process. Anything for dem woke points."
1436,So asinine that their entire concept of womanhood is created and validated by other men as if it has nothing to do with actually being a woman
1437,I think this exact community was quick to delete and condemn posts making fun of that blue eyeshadow sissy photo (and this is a sub that regularly makes fun of women posting even remotely low quality content).

1439,"its really strange how they can connect everything to us, whether disliking us or actively wanting to harm us. Would be flattered if it wasn't so oddly obsessive lol. 

I think most of us come on here and just engage in the politics and theory, but these people literally have to just be sitting at home, and think of stuff like this. ""Hey wash ur hands"" = ""Huehue just like i would if i touched a TERF !! huehue ...."""
1440,"Them: ""wash your hands like you accidentally touched a TERF haha!""

Also them: ""filthy TERF cisbians who won't sleep with me need to go to re-education camps for girldick! Being touched by lesbians is a human right!"""
1441,What else do they do with their lives besides think up dumb memes and cartoons?
1442,"If you want to put the absurdity to a whole other level. Swap out terf for any slur for transgender. 

And imagine how much shit you'd get yourself into. 

How is it acceptable for them to get away with this derogatory shit"
1443,"Bold of them to assume most of their brethren bathe, wash their hands, and practice other basic hygiene."
1444,When you have to specify “Coronavirus-affected” areas because you’re used to propping up alternative realities so maybe somewhere in your fantasies there are non-affected areas but...here’s the deal....on Earth it’s pretty much everywhere. As are terfs.
1445,No one wants to touch you weirdo
1446,I know we are all strong incredible people but they need to stop obsessing about us. Its like all they ever do is think about us.
1447,i thought they wanted to touch us??? what happened to raping terfs to teach us a lesson and pressuring lesbians to sleep with them?
1448,Not only is it immature but it is also very idiotic. Just like their community.
1449,"""Ew, girl cooties!""

Men are fucking infantile."
1450,"That's LOW. I truly couldn't care less NOW about any concept anyone has about anything else besides the current world crisis, and neither should anyone, focus on the important. THAT whatever that is, comes off as intolerant, uneducated, with no moral or purpose. What the fuck was that supposed to mean exactly ?! People are dying oh but don't forget to hate some of them, people lost their jobs, salaries, but hey we can still crack a joke on their account about others who disagree with us ! If yes then let's all fucking wash our hands like we just buried humanity. I can't believe I am stuck home seeing this bullshit."
1451,"They're honestly so fucking sad, it's truly disheartening."
1452,lol if they stop touching “terfs” wouldn’t that just make everyone happy?
1453,Oh but you want much more that to actually touch 😑😑
1454,Seeing this in conjunction with the fact that they want to rape all of us is fascinating.
1455,"All they want to do is touch ""TERFS"". Cotton ceiling?"
1456,I'd gladly shake hands with or even hug any terf and then only wash my hands because I'm a very clean person and I don't like going too long without washing my hands.
1457,"Also just imagine their reaction if ""TERFs"" posted *half* of the shit they posted about us. Threats of violence aside, fantasies of our torture aside, imagine if we posted ""wash your hands like you would if you touched a trans!"" They'd lose their collective shit comparing it to every other historical injustice any group has ever suffered and talk about how ""they want us exterminated, they see us as germs, etc.""

But when they do it, it's ""just a joke bro"""
1458,Watch way too much porn.
1459,Bc misogyny is in a lot of Societies accepted.
1460,Yes. Exactly. This was the point I tried to make in another comment here - you're exactly right
1461,"I want to make a sub where all of these images are reversed, but we all know how well that'd go over. These people are just *so good* with subtlety and nuance."
1462,Right? Usually their hair looks like overcooked noodles soaked in grease.
1463,"They haven't left their houses in years, that's why they're thinking like that."
1464,Or punching us?
1465,"misogyny is crazy like that. these people spend all their time on the internet, circlejerking to their hatred of women together. it literally shapes their entire world view. 

and im glad ive never, ever seen a genuinely malicious comment about trans people in radfem spaces. i've seen actual jokes, i've seen frustration and anger, but i've never seen someone say something that had me worried about the safety of those around them.

countless posts and comments from tra's make me genuinely and viscerally worried about the safety of the people around them, especially when it comes to mothers, i've seen terrible things. 

just hope this whole thing will end soon"
1466,"And I would read that post, roll my eyes, and scroll on with my life. I doubt much of a, “Yeah we don’t touch the trans lol omg ew” circle jerk would ever catch on here regardless of content."
1467,High five for both us commenting at the same time and using “circlejerk” LOL perfect
