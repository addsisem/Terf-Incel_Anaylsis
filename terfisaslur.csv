0,AutoModerator,"Welcome to r/terfisaslur. 

What is a ""TERF""? While ""TERF"" is supposed to stand for ""Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist,"" the people called ""TERF"" generally are neither radical feminists nor ""trans exclusionary,"" and in practice the term has become a slur. [More info.](https://redd.it/70cyzm)

We're documenting hateful rhetoric directed at lesbians, radical feminists, gender critical feminists, and others on Reddit and beyond.

If you're curious about why certain trans activists are clashing with some feminists, see [these resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/wiki/resources#wiki_great_resources_for_people_new_to_gender_critical_feminism) from r/GenderCritical.

1,GenderIsntCritical,"They can change their hair or what they wear, but no matter what they do, a man is still a man"
2,WikiMB,That explains how much violent the response for any skepticism regarding transgenderism is. And because of it I either hide or use my alt account to rise my voice on topics like these.
3,Killy00013,Am I misreading this? It sounds like she doesn't belive both sides behave badly calling it a fallacy and also seems to support jk rowling by saying that those who send her death and rape threats arent women
4,maat89,And I opp....
5,Tulcey-Lee,"I had an account locked yesterday on twitter. Unable to have a discussion with said person as they resorted to calling me a bitch and a terf and then the rape threats started. How is it now we live in a world where you can’t disagree anymore? Your opinion means you are fine to be harassed and threatened. 
I stated biology and that women don’t have a penis and there was no coherent argument just abuse."
6,Cha-Challenger,"They can change their name or what they call themselves, but no matter what they do, a terf is still a terf. (Ironic huh)"
7,qsims,She doesn’t she’s pointing out how bullshit the claim is
8,Cha-Challenger,What did you do to cause this? Can you link the thread?
9,Killy00013,"she forgot to put /s then, I hate when people are sarcastic online, I usually cant tell because nowdays you can say the most fcked up things and actually mean them"
10,Tulcey-Lee,"They said some
Women have penis’s and I said no they don’t."
11,qsims,But she’s not being sarcastic..?
12,Killy00013,"if she isnt sarcastic then she sounds like she is on jk's side, that's how i see it"
13,qsims,I’m sorry I don’t understand how?
14,2or3thingsIknow,They simply do not care. Because of all the social capital they have they are literally acting like terrorists and slamming women all over the place.
15,baconbitsy,"Honey, the amount of people who use “TERF” to stop a discussion is ridiculous.  “I’m not gonna debate you because you’re a TERF!” followed by a lot of nonsensical insults just proves what they really are: misogynists."
16,Vibrosphere,You're invalidating the women who menstruate by sticking tomato juice Popsicles in their recta and collecting the meltjuice with tampons and menstrual pads.
17,Simone_Auclert,If you're woman who acknowledges reality you're a terf.
18,,[removed]
19,Cha-Challenger,First off all they're not saying MtFs can have periods. They're saying FtMs can still have periods post transition.
20,mypretties,"They have a ton of time of their hands since 99% of society wants nothing to do with them.

TIMs: “I can be a normal man and go out and achieve a good life for myself or I can sit in my mom’s basement, shriek TERF at her if she questions me stealing my sister’s panties, eat cheetos, stick tomato juice up my ass and mod r/actuallesbians. Hmmm gonna have to go with choice #2!”"
21,stargazer612,Oh dear gawd is this a thing????
22,TheCatsEyeNebula,A few months and they'll use this as an arguement.
23,BellejarredDylan,But testosterone stops periods. So Ftm shouldn't be having them
24,Vibrosphere,"You know I want to go shake my finger at the youth and yell at them to GTFO my lawn but a lot of the most egregious TIMs are men older than myself (41)

Like, bro, you should know better."
25,Vibrosphere,Well documented.
26,Idkjustgotquestions,Depends for some it takes a while for it to take effect and some aren’t on hormone replacement yet.
27,insomniac29,I know an FTM that sometimes gets periods for missing hormone doses. A lot of trans people don’t have regular access to treatment. They’re saving up for a hysterectomy. Or technically someone who hasn’t started treatment yet or for some reason doesn’t want medical treatment could identify as trans.
28,stargazer612,Just researched and will now scrub my browser history. Omg
29,BellejarredDylan,Im still going to only say women have periods
30,insomniac29,"Okay that’s fine, I’m just responding to your post saying that an FTM can’t have a period, they sometimes do."
31,girl_undone,Locked because this is still getting brigaded a month later.

51,sarahkate2011,Karma whoring at its finest.
52,QueenRowana,"What we want if for men to stay out of womens spaces. Simple. Fighting for women is a good thing. If that means some men get their little girl panties (that they love wearing so much) in a twist. I ain’t upset. And if they want to use slurs and threaten us while doing it. Well thats hurtful but still inconsequential. Because that report button isn’t just decorative.  I’m standing up for women so men, yeah i dont care if you chop off your dick or wear a dress and makeup.  They’re never gonna be a woman. 
Have a lovely day!"
53,QueenRowana,"I love that this is still pissing men off almost a month later. Men who, by the way, are not and never will be women. Sorry you have no life. Big F (whatever that means)"
54,QueenRowana,I don’t think i understand what you mean?
55,QueenRowana,"Right so how much of that post did you read and how long have the Tims been whispering in your ear? 

Women’s spaces should be for women and women only. These weirdos in wigs and dresses are not and can never be women. No matter how badly they mutilate their genitals. I will not bow down to their behavior and i will not accept insults from “allies” like you.  You contribute to a system that demeans women and denies us our existence. A system that doesn’t even allow lesbian her sexuality anymore. A system where a male mediocre weightlifter can decide today that he is a woman and start winning gold medals in women’s classifications tomorrow. 

Terf is a foul slur usually accompanied by threats of beatings, rapes and murder to women who refuse to cater to men’s fragile ego’s and most notably their autogynephila and fetishes. 
I refuse to be called names by woke weirdos like you who think women should die when all we want is to make men get out of our faces, out of our sports and out of out bathrooms. We dont want them to die, we want them to act like a normal human being. Not a anime doll. But you just echo what they teach you. 

Next time you call someone trash please re-read this message and realize i could have just insulted you right back. But i didnt do that. Now try and see who is the one between us two capable of calm and rational thought and who has used cursewords as their only retort to a woman standing up for herself."
56,QueenRowana,"They’re men. The text says nothing about qualification. I wouldnt want to be treated by an unqualfied woman either. But i dint want to be cared for by a man perion.  These are men, not “trans women!?!!” And yes they are attempting to steal women only spaces. They are men. It’s their ultimate goal it seems."
57,QueenRowana,Correct i didn’t write it. But i had not seen it on this sub before and loved it. I agree with it completely. Men can get the hell out if womens spaces. They are not welcome. And diaper fetishists too by the way sir!
58,auklet,"Terf is used as a slur, by trans rights activists. You'll often hear it in phrases such as ""kill all terfs.""  I think many ""terfs"" agree that ""terf""  is an accurate term when used to mean ""woman who doesn't agree that a man can become a woman."" But trans activists use it to mean, ""Person who refuses to validate my claim to be a woman and therefore should be humiliated, ostracized, and murdered. """

64,kaladinner,"Gotcha, thanks. Are the majority of you also sex-worker exclusionary as well? If you remove delusions of infinite genders, and hedonistic pornographer women being glorified, then I can get behind feminism. I mean, I'm still gonna call obese, dyed haired women ""SJWs""; and I'm sure as hell not denying that men are biologically stronger than women, but other non-sexually-immoral ideologies you guys hold are fine by me."
65,QueenRowana,"I’m not against normal men who mind their own business at all. Men can be great. I’m only against trans people if they are men trying to get away with stuff and get into female spaces by wearing dresses and turning their penis inside out or even just claiming they are women while they arent even remotely trying, they are literally just men. I have little to no trouble with women who try to become men. They don’t bother me usually. I say good luck to them. They are still weird but I wish them luck fitting in with men. But men trying to be women. Yeah i have something against them and i will fight against them and for women.  

Every day. 

Again. Have a nice day."
66,QueenRowana,"I didnt write it. I do agree with it though. 

I never said YOU were a man. I just said ‘men’ but if you felt like i was talking about you go off i guess. 

And are you sure you’re a woman. Isn’t that enforcing a gender binary which could hurt trans peoples feelings? (Big sarcasm in case you didn’t get that)"
67,QueenRowana,"I am indeed not bothered at all by that. Because i care about women and preserving our spaces, not about the fragile ego’s of men who like to wear dresses and want to be called “ma’am”"
68,QueenRowana,That dont mean it’s untrue though. Men with a trans fetish are a danger to women. Whether i wrote it or not doesnt make it false.
69,auklet,"Radical feminists,  ftom what I read, see ""sex work"" including porn as exploitative."
70,girl_undone,"It's a misnomer to say feminists are ""excluding"" ""sex workers"" when we say that the men who rape and sell women in sexual slavery and prostitution are horrible and shouldn't be able to do that."

73,kaladinner,Can you elaborate?
74,QueenRowana,"Trans ‘women’ are men. The reason they don’t pass is because they are men. Not women. 

> . Men don’t try to get into female spaces by being trans. 

Lol. It’s 50% “grr i’m not allowed in womens [fill in here: bathroom, locker room, rape shelter, prison] Let’s put on a dress and waltz in, no one will dare stop me”. These are predators out to get weak women and many cases are documented of  so called “trans women” (men) getting permission to go to female prision instead of male and at the very least creeping the fuck out of vulnerable women and at worst rape and hurt them. Many cases about men freaking out for not being admitted to women rape shelters. Cases of men sendingvdeath threats to lesbians who refuse to fuck men with dicks. Of pedophiles who claim to be trans to get lowered sentences. Of men going Into womens bathrooms with ugly dresses and terrible fake wigs just for fun and to terrify women in a space where once they would have come to get away from men. 

And 50% “ i just want to have tits to play with and be submissive slut in bed”. Of which the last one i will admit are usually not quite as nefarious. But they’re definitely AGP."
75,QueenRowana,"Fetish? Lol i have literally 0 fetishes.  Your “tendencies” are a fetish. 
I care about women enough to not want men with dicks forcing themselves into lesbian spaces, into women rape shelters, into womens locker rooms, toilets and prisons.  If your main objective is forcing women to just lie down and take it while men like you walk all over them you are not a feminist."
76,,[removed]
77,QueenRowana,"Fascination with “lady dick”? I have never used that word except to express my disgust at the word. Maybe you mistook my disgusted frustration at men referring to penises as a “girldick” for fascination, HalfBreed?

Men like you saying stuff like ‘kill terfs’ are inciting violence against women yet somehow i’m the one who doesnt care about women? Thats cute dude! Such a male thing to do!
Hope you have a great day!"
78,,[removed]
79,QueenRowana,"Frustration at Lack of having a maledick. Lol. No thanks. Dick can be nice, but not on me, only in me. 

You dont have a ‘girldick’ if such a thing even exists. You just have a dick. You’re a man.. simple. 

Three legs??? Your dick being leg three then. Yes. Sounds accurate..."

This is one of the worst ones I've seen so far."
81,SearchLightsInc,“Sorry to hear you felt assaulted but we all know women don’t really feel fear for rational reasons and it was probably an overreaction on your part sweetheart x “ /s
82,pennysapphic,"Oh I'm so sorry to hear about your experience and ptsd... but you'll still find a way to swallow it down for the comfort of men, right? 

Oh I'm so sorry that you were raped, but you still understand that *not all men* do that, right? You musnt forget to say that before and after you apologetically share what happened to you. 

Oh I'm sorry the rape crisis center was defunded by a man, but I hope you understand it's because those women were bigots for wanting to heal privately and with dignity. Their wants outweigh your needs, because as a woman, you are everything they wish they were. This is ""privledge"", not objectification. 

Oh I'm so so sorry to hear you didnt place in your sport after training your whole life because men now compete in womens sports. But the fact they get the limited scholarships and opportunities for women, should really be an inspiration for you to just work harder and be quietly supportive.

Oh I'm so so VERY sorry that abortions are punishable by a life sentence in certain states and getting harder and harder to access, but it seems so exclusionary since transwomen dont get to experience this, so we shouldn't focus on it. The most important thing is that everything is about transwomen all the time. If it's not, then it's about how it hurts them that it's not, and THAT is the important peice of every puzzle. 

Oh, you dont like the red robes they are rolling out...I'm so so so sorry about that. But it's because you are lucky enough to be born a woman. I wish I was a woman, red is definitely my color and the cap hides my male pattern baldness UwU"

85,watpompyelah,"Still ridiculous to me that they have to push so much that “trans women *are* women.” Like ok, if they’re really women, why do they have to specify the trans part? Why not just say they’re women and be done with it? 

Why? Because they know it’s bullshit. They know trans women aren’t really women."

When's the last time (before this post) you've heard a man say that women or some specific group of women had value only as holes to fuck? I'm going to guess recently. This is 100% the kind of language insecure men use to attack women."

So it just a waiting game for now.
263,Lady_Montgomery,"When you think you are the opposite sex you are most definitely mentally ill. Its like saying you are born in the wrong body and that you are an alien from galaxy 1000 miles away. It's not real. It's a mask for something else. A personality disorder, childhood trauma, even trauma in later life, autism, internalized homophobia, internalized misogyny, plain old misogyny (when it comes to men claiming to be women) etc. It's a symptom. Not an actual thing. But it's also a multi billion business that preys on the unstable. As long as there are people that can make a shit load of money on the mentally disturbed they will. Providing actual help doesn't make people as much money. And as long as people sign a contract that says informed consent, they can actually get away with it. It's vile and grotesque.

Every single person that claims to be of the opposite gender is at least highly mentally unstable and often times mentally ill."

272,Eowyn19,Exactly what I was thinking. It’s already happened. Hardly any libfems even know about trans criminals because discussing them is “literally violence”.
273,0WatcherintheWater0,"You seem to not understand modern gender theory. What makes someone a certain gender is a combination of three things. 1) identity (what gender you see yourself as), 2) body (what physical characteristics society prescribes to different genders), and 3) presentation (what behaviors are prescribed to certain genders, an example would be gender roles). You’ll notice that chromosomes have nothing to do with it. So long as Trans people fit two out of those three things, they **are** the opposite gender, your opinion on the subject is irrelevant.  They aren’t mentally ill. Gender dysphoria still is a mental illness, of course, but for separate reasons, and a lot of trans people aren’t dysphoric.

Also, it’s not a mask, sure there are trans people who change in order to cover up past trauma, but the vast majority are sincere in their beliefs. 

May I ask, what do you think would actually help trans people beyond surgery? Therapy wouldn’t do anything beyond maybe making them more suicidal, that’s for sure."
274,FTThrowAway123,"Report to the [FBI](https://tips.fbi.gov/). You can submit a tip online. I've submitted tips twice before. Both times an agent called me back promptly and seemed to take it seriously.  

Also, the [U.S. Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/how-do-i/report-suspicious-activity) has suggestions.  

>""If You See Something, Say Something®"" is a national campaign that raises public awareness of the indicators of terrorism and terrorism-related crime, as well as the importance of reporting suspicious activity to state and local law enforcement.  

I'll be reporting to both. This is above Reddits paygrade, nor do I trust them to actually do anything about it."
275,2or3thingsIknow,"Yep, he's a real psycho that one."
276,Lady_Montgomery,"I heard all that bs before and it's a cry for attention. There males and females. Gender roles are bs. Chromosomes determine your sex, which equals your gender. The end. Basic biology. So called trans people need psychological help to determine what is truly the matter with them: a personality disorder, autism, trauma (sexual or other wise), internalized homophobia/misogyny. The only reason it isn't qualified as a mental disorder officially is because it has become a multi billion industry. The profits made to mutilate so called transgenders are so incredibly high. So of course they want the medical world to say its okay and normal. Trans people do not exist. It's as simple as that. A d you know it too else you wouldn't be commenting here. You are looking for validation from people who are telling you the truth. If you can convince us, you can convince yourself. I wish you the best. And I hope you find proper help to help you with either you personality disorder or your past trauma you haven't dealt with yet. Good luck.

BTW if you aren't dysphoric, no need to mutilate your body either and pump it full with hormones your body isnt meant to produce. You know doing that when you aren't dysphoric doesn't make sense."

289,bishhpls,"If something sums up these people's utter hatred and contempt for women, this is it. The fact they are demanding women who have been traumatised by men and their male bodies allow them into the one space that is meant to be totally free of those traumatic elements, simply to validate their 'true and honest womanhood' is nothing short of horrifying. If a literal rape crisis centre isn't safe, where is?

They want to allow men who have a sexual fetish regarding objectifying women into a slew of outdated sexist stereotypes into a place where women are healing from sexual trauma. Where they will most likely exude exhibitionism and sexually harass these vulnerable women. All for sexual gratification and their own validation. TIMs claim to need these centres, and some may, but I believe the number of them that truly need shelter may be quite low and the rest are just creepy boundary pushing AGPs. Yet when they are offered separate accommodations away from the women, that just isn't good enough, they must be treated as exactly the same as a biological woman, even though they are NOT the same and belong to the group who victimised the women in the first place. That tells you all you need to know. They do not care about the actual shelter, they just care they're not included and not being constantly validated. So selfish."

350,avicioustradition,"You'll never be a man. Until the day you die and forever afterward you'll be a woman with short hair, an intentional chemical imbalance and depending on your personal decisions extensive plastic surgery and body modifications. You're not a man. You can scream it as loudly as you like, but it won't make reality any different. You don't want to be a woman, I get that. I can't blame you. The world can be kinda shitty for us. However, you can't just opt-out of reality. I can say I’m a walrus --but if I show up on a beach none of the other walruses are going to be particularly impressed me and zero percent of them will buy it. As for the rest of what I wrote, the concept remains the same so I don't see a point in editing it. 

( Correction: in order to not feed into delusional thinking I did indeed edit pronouns in my previous comment in order to reflect reality.) 

You understood it clearly enough. You don't have to be a girly girl, you can have short hair, you can have your breasts removed--you can take hormones if you want because its your body and you can do what you want with it --but how you express your personal aesthetics has exactly zero impact on biological fact.  You're still a woman and the rest of the world has no obligation to play along with your fantasy. You need to accept who you actually are, a non conformist  woman, instead of making up a whole new person to distance yourself from the things you dislike about the world and your body."

354,griffxx,"There is a high probability this kind of violence could happen. I feel we are coming to a pivot point. I think the JK Rowling tweet really got people to recognize what's being said by these Feminized Men and the biological incoherence that is the foundation of the Movement.

395,AbolishGender,"Same.  I’ve been semi-out as a radfem for a while, but recently I’ve stopped playing their bullshit language games and openly calling TIMs men.  Most of the women I know who agree with me are WOC (like myself)."
396,PsychicCaramelle,They want to be able to slag off women without appearing like just your average misogynist - going after 'white women' instead of just 'women' is how they try and hide their true nature.
397,PassRestProd,"I’m in complete agreement. I’ve seen so many Twitter conversations that go like this, with the inevitable, “Oh, wow, this post sure took off! By the way, since you’re here...” It’s pathetic how common it is to see - I’m curious if it really works, tbh, or if the cold hard reality of TRAs being too self-absorbed to help means the “burden” falls on ww trying to buy their way into being woke, and, by then, maybe a handful actually follow through."

You are not agreeing with me, you are defending against my view and supporting this kind of post - that is not agreeing with me, that is pretty much *disagreeing* with me, unless you are basically saying ''Yes I agree that this kind of post weakens the purpose of the subreddit but I think it should be allowed because there's nothing wrong with weakening the purpose of the subreddit''."

I’ve said I actually SEE your point and agree with you. Once again, I was playing devil’s advocate on OP’s part. I never said it SHOULD be allowed, I’m just using Socratic questioning to *ask* if it’s okay once in a while. That doesn’t mean I think it should be posted. 

I’m not supporting this kind of post. Calm down."
408,moonflower,"You said you were ''sticking up for'' OP which implies that OP is under some kind of attack and needs to be defended.

You say you were ''asking'' if it should be allowed, but why would you even ask, if you didn't think it should be allowed? The very question suggests that you are defending that it should be allowed, as if I have said it shouldn't be, which I didn't.

Also I don't need to ''calm down'', and there is nothing to be gained by telling me to do so, unless your aim is to imply that I have lost control and become hysterical."

427,,"tbh i've finally had this coalesce in my mind and i've been trying to bring it up at every opportunity. the \*mere engagement in trans identification\* is abusive because it is \*gaslighting\*. I have not seen \*one\* man in a dress who doesn't engage in the abusive factors of 1) denying reality (with the expectation that those he demands deny it as well) and 2) threatening violence (on himself or others) when or even just at the possibility that people don't comply with his demands of reality denial. (Threats to 't\*rfs' or 'transphobes' and threats to himself through threatening suicide or implying that not denying reality will force others to kill themselves.) 

&#x200B;

i now believe (and have seen no evidence otherwise) that these men who ""identify as women"" are unilaterally abusers, because at the bare minimum their gaslighting is abusive. with abuse comes predatory behavior, and thank you for saying this because i had not thought about that aspect of it too. the more time i spend here and on sister subs and read news articles (like the [recent win by a young man with pink hair to have unrestricted access to all the masturbatory aid he needed in the form of real live uncensored vulnerable teenage women](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/11/14/palatine-schaumburg-high-school-district-votes-to-give-transgeder-students-unrestricted-locker-room-access/)) the more i am convinced that every single one is a narcissistic abusive predator."

442,SometimesJacka,"So true. 

In addition because there are less boundaries between the communities they get really paranoid and start flagging any sort of woman centered content as ‘terf-y’. Too much of social faux pas for them to be caught anywhere near ‘terf’ content or people. 

It’s funny when the opposite happens — rad fems reblogging TRA or QT content. The notes on those posts are just hilarious. Rad fems acknowledge good posts regardless of the poster, so not only do TRAs / QT have to be careful about who they follow and what they reblog, they have to make sure their content doesn’t appeal to radical feminists either. 


But yes the witch hunts for ‘terfs’ on tumblr is a real thing."
443,2or3thingsIknow,This guy thinks trans males can gestate babies. Just an FYI. Seems to dislike actual feminists.
444,moonflower,Because your title implied that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc - but I think the person who called them 'terfs' was very likely referring back to a previous discussion

456,moonflower,"Yes, but that's another issue. Are you disagreeing with anything I said?"
457,moonflower,"You said: ""Mentioning anything about patriarchy, exploitation and trauma are ‘terfy’ now"" ... how is that *not* implying that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc?

You're denying what's right in front of you and laughing about it."
458,moonflower,"Oh yes, of course it was inappropriate, but the point I was making was that the accusation of 'terf' probably wasn't based on those comments - and we already know that people who use 'terf' as a derogatory term wouldn't be interested in discussing anything about how to protect female people, so they probably didn't even think about the current discussion, only concerned about silencing 'terfs'"
459,,[removed]
460,LesbianPrincess-,"Gee, I wonder why! What a loser lol. He should be banned from this subreddit. I reported the rude comments but maybe mods haven’t gotten to them yet 🤷‍♀️"
461,olatundew,"Well, if we're splitting hairs, I disagree that it's ""very likely"" that this was in response to a previous comment.

More to the point, I do think that this part of the same issue - how do we have constructive conversations about complicated gender issues?"
462,LesbianPrincess-,"What exactly am I denying? I’m just disagreeing with you. 

Honestly, you’ve been very rude to me in the past and I would like to be done with this convo. I actually know how tumblr works and this stuff is all too common. Plus there are too many users on there for there to be people who remember users’ “prior terfy conversations” or whatever. Men call us terfs for being feminists. Period. 

Bye.

Edit: Apparently the person I'm talking to is a MALE! What a surprise. Dominating the conversation and telling women that we don't know what we're talking about. He should be banned. Mansplaining at its finest, and he has the audacity to call himself a feminist. Wow."
463,,"Exactly, so that person is a trash gremlin regardless of what they were referencing. So it doesn't really matter."
464,LesbianPrincess-,"😹😹😹 We get it, you’re insecure and projecting because of your small penis. Bye."
465,moonflower,"Do you really think it is at all likely that this person called them 'terfs' based solely on those comments, with no previous history between them?"
466,moonflower,"You are denying that your title implies that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc.

Also, how ironic that you complain of people who judge current comments based on prior conversations, at the same time as you are doing that exact same thing to me - you are the one who is being rude here, and rude in the past - way ruder than I have ever been to you.

I disagree with things that you say, and call you out on your bad behaviour, and you interpret that as ''rudeness'' and use it as an excuse to be even more rude to me."
467,moonflower,I think it does matter if OP is misrepresenting the situation
468,2or3thingsIknow,"Yes, because that is what these clownfish do. They label anything and everything terf because they cannot answer. Stop pretending you haven't seen this."
469,olatundew,"That's a slightly different claim from the original one, but yes - I've seen TERF used in some pretty atrocious ways (e.g. ""I'm going to rape you, you fucking TERF"") so I wouldn't rule it out. Plus, this particular comment they were responding to was purposeful and well-written, and seemed to be the beginning of a new conversation - so it seems a non-sequiter for it to have been part of an ongoing (quite bitter) dialogue."
470,LesbianPrincess-,"I’m not denying it. My “Nah. Lol” was just dismissing what you were saying. 

I’m just saying I don’t have time to argue with you when you’ve been rude in the past. Move along. Blocking you because I don’t have time for this weird drama. Lol. And not sure what “bad behavior” you’re referencing. Pretty weird."
471,,There's no actual evidence that the situation is being misrepresented though???
472,moonflower,Actually I have never seen anyone called a 'terf' unless they have said something which suggests that they believe that male people cannot become female
473,moonflower,I don't really understand your reasoning at all - I came to the opposite conclusion based on exactly the same perception that it was a new conversation and *therefore* inappropriate to be calling anyone 'terfs' in response to the subject matter - much more likely that the person calling them 'terfs' was referring to a different conversation
474,moonflower,"OK, we'll see if you really do block me - perhaps that means I will be free to speak my views in future without you being rude and denying reality all over my comments eh"
475,moonflower,"Not on the linked page, no, but I think it's very likely that the accusation of 'terf' was in reference to a previous encounter and not based on the shown comments"
476,2or3thingsIknow,Male people are male people. Not female. Males. Stop fucking colonizing us you sick bastards. I'm done playing nice with you creeps.
477,olatundew,"That's because we're talking about two different scenarios. I'm saying this doesn't look like an out-of-context snippet of conversation, you're saying it does look like there is a background context to their relationship. Both could be true, or neither."
478,,[deleted]
479,zombieeezzz,Holy shit. Shut up. You keep repeating this point and no one cares.
480,,You think it’s very likely. Which means you have no actual evidence and all of the drama you’re causing about this is based on nothing but a hunch that nobody even cares about.

The other day I posted a commented empathizing with a woman female or trans I don’t know) who said she had been sexually assaulted and wanted to know if others thought she should report the friend who attacked her. Others said to report her rapist. I was empathic and also said that if she didn’t report him he would go on to rape other women. I finished with something like “Think of your sisters”. 

Some trans person must have looked at my profile or recognized my Reddit name and screamed at me online about having no right to comment, I was a pretend feminist, etc. 

Unfuckingbelievable!  Nothing I said was particularly feminist. It was just one woman empathasizing with the suffering of another woman at the hands of a man who attacked her. One human being reaching out to comfort another. 

The person who reacted so badly to not being centered in that moment was a man larping as a woman and doing it badly because he failed Female Bonding 101. 

He’s a man because his rage at me was so disproportionate to my comment and to the tone of the comment (empathy and sisterly advice which the woman asked for). 

He’s a man because he immediately jumped to who owns feminism when that wasn’t the topic. 

He’s a man because if it isn’t about him he can’t be quiet or move along. 

He’s a man because maybe the topic of sexual assault, rape, and friends who are attackers hit to close to home so he had to derail the thread."

That's how they can twist this crappy theory to say GC are white supremacist because queer theorists queer the system so anyone who stops that is supporting the system. This is why it's pointless people arguing that GC can't be white supremacists because we're diverse and anti racist because it's all actually logical through critical race theory. It's these evidence free, bullying activist theories and their proponents which need to be argued against."

I think another large chunk are people who ""don’t understand it"" and think that because it doesn’t make sense to them it must be intellectually above their heads and therefore super smart and enlightened and deferring to the loudest people is correct and deferring to the ""marginalized"" is woke and a harmless (to them) and easy way to ""be a good person"".

\*\*in here before some TRA tries to use handpicked, debunked claims of ""uhhhhhh ahcktually trans people won all the gay rights for you you're welcome uwu"" because if trans people actually DID achieve all those civil rights victories, then they should have had no problem fighting for their **own** acceptance without needing to hide behind the LGB shield and pretend same-sex love is AT ALL similar to dress-up"

GD is a minor brain abnormality that changes the self identity and anxiety while most of the brain is like usual for the natal sex. Thus it's not surprising that it's the MTF population that are causing most of the problems while we hardly hear anything from the FTM population despite the fast growth caused by the ROGD epidemic. 

The paraphilic/AGP subpopulation of male GD is likely the most common offender because of their abnormal sexual drive. We've seen this with JY and other famous cases where multiple paraphilias overlap within the same individual. It's sad to see it has become taboo to talk about abnormal sexualities. Sexuality is by no means an area devoid of pathological behaviours. On the contrary, the intense sexual urge (especially for men) can cause a wide range of pathological/perverse/paraphilic behaviours.

Turns out, I enjoy this corner of reddit more than all the other increasingly ridiculous subs and now am hardly ever on my “actual” account. So, this is my actual account :) I’d take participating in these spaces over the rest if that’s how it has to be. 

I don’t mean any disrespect to her (the mod) but someone who obviously thinks sex work is a fine way to make money and continuously responds with condescension when someone confesses details of her rape? Dear, her ability to think outside the rules of the TRA cult is barely there, if at all. So many people on reddit get a thrill out of witch (pun heh) hunting “terfs”. You’d think maybe we could see this is the internet and allow for people to still post in your subs as long as what they post was appropriate...but we have long left the shores of reason.

But of course a traumatic response towards ""AMAB"" people isn't valid by their standards. In what universe is telling someone who isn't hurting anyone to ""manage your trauma like everyone else"" appropriate? There's something really insidious about this that I can't quite put my finger on, it's as if the mod feels entitled to your emotional state, as if the insides of your brain are obligated to be free of any thoughtcrimes against TIMs. This framing of trauma as something ""problematic"" that you basically need to get over for the benefit of others is absolutely vile."

At the moment a transwoman is trying to say that I’m sexist and rely on stereotypes. I’m a woman. I don’t need to rely on stereotypes to be a woman, a just am a woman! The cheek of some of these people.

(I must say that this is the only trans person that I’ve ever met or spoken to that believe that he is now a female, and really hates women, with a passion it seems. I assume because he can never be one. He’s not converting anyone to his cause of opening up all women’s spaces to men.)"

761,politipoop,"Fuck, I’m sorry. It really doesn’t help that men are now allowed to roam around freely in them, and be applauded for doing it. It is still extremely difficult for me to use a public bathroom without having flashbacks/panic attacks. I hope you’re doing ok."
762,politipoop,"I’m glad I know now, and I’m glad others know about it too. The way that mod tried to bully me is exactly what another transwoman is also trying to do to me :D Exactly the same points: “your ptsd is nothing”, “my feelings are more important than women’s safety”, “get over it”.

So scary how they seem to have the same points when it comes to hating women and trying to keep us quiet, good little slaves.

If they actually want to be women, why do they hate us so much?"
763,politipoop,Oooh!
764,politipoop,Definitely a ridiculous sub that only wants the “right” kind of women participating.
765,politipoop,It really is frightening how they’ve managed to fool so many people.

769,politipoop,"What? Wasn’t that post massively popular?

This is what we have to endure now. This is the next big stand we have to take as women. When people try to silence you and threaten you instead of talking, then we know how dictatorial they are.

Keep it up though! It doesn’t matter how much they abuse us and try to intimidate us into silence, we’ll keep going!"
770,burntmatchesburn3x,It is nothing close to radical feminist.
771,GathGreine,"They all seem to be trapped in the LibFem world view where any dissonance is literal violence.  I can’t take this garbage any more.  I used to be just like them; plugging my ears to anyone who was labeled TERF by the community without even looking into what they said myself.  

Years ago though, that used to be actual homophobic, super religious people on Twitter who have serious problems with gay and GNC people in the first place. 

Today all you have to do is be caught fraternizing with the “enemy”.  I wish these little buggers would just GROW UP already.  Especially as an American, I’m worried that they are unknowingly chipping away at our free speech rights."

This is their way to silence us and keep people from knowing the truth."
774,espresia,"Yeah, for me they said “no bigots allowed”"
775,espresia,LMAO what a perfect way to put it.
776,CryptographicBison,"They use masstagger, it automatically flairs other users who have posted in 'bad' subs like this one. They generally have no clue what your 'bad' posted were, or how long ago you made them, they just see the flair and ban immediately."

It was supposed to be used for REAL members of Hate Subreddits; White men who are anti-Semitic, racist, think that certain minorities should be genocide etc. But they are also using it on anyone who has visited what they term ""GC"" Subreddits.

The MODs can see the tags. They no longer have to go through your history."

784,Wiggy_Bop,"Oh yeah, it’s a bot for sure."
785,redlilitu,"They transformed the Triple Goddess into an all-male trinity which erases femaleness from the act of creation. They transformed the tree of life, a symbol of the Goddess and creation, into a cross which is no less than a dead tree in which a dead man is nailed. They substituted Lilith with a male-born subservient Eve. They replace Myrine, also known as Marian, a moon/sea-goddess, known as mother of all gods, with a virgin subservient, completely null Mary, the virgin mother of god who is merely a vessel in an all-male creation myth. They subverted the symbolism of the cauldron to the chalice containing the blood of Christ (could it be more necrophiliac and cannibalistic than that?). I could go on and on. All they did with female-centric mythology was subvert all life-giving, life-creating symbols to all-male ""creators"" who worship death and destruction."
786,jupiterssunday,"Unfortunately for lesbians, being attracted only to women is now the height of bigotry.  If you’re not into penises you’d better either unlearn your fetish and have sex with penises or cop a beating terf (and then have sex with penises)

Yay progress."
787,knight_siegmeyer,"Completely understand. It's one of the more frustrating aspects of this dumb bathroom debate. Mostly because I feel people with so called good intentions don't wanna admit that people do bad things. Well, correction, men do bad things to women and little girls and it's somehow outside the realm of their understanding that YES men would certainly lie to take advantage of a situation to gain access to someone vulnerable. And funnily enough, men agree on some level that men can't be trusted. 

The arguement 'oh well, if they want to assault women a law against not being in the bathroom won't stop them' which, true it won't. But by that same logic we just shouldn't have gun control cuz 'people are gonna get guns illegally if they want them'. But a law is the law and having a societal barrier that says 'men should not be in women's bathrooms' is more of a deterrent than just breaking it down and saying 'yep! Men welcomed! Go on in boys!'    

I hope you're doing well, too. That sub can kick rocks."
788,06549r,"Not forever. They are losing the sympathetic ignorance that gave them so much power. Every single time there’s a “controversy” and they reply with their nonsense more people are waking up. 

The JK Rowling issue brought so many people to our subs, and once someone finds out the truth there’s no going back."
789,artificialgraymatter,"Yeah.

790,artificialgraymatter,That person is a troll who just hates anything connected to women.
791,bishhpls,"This is all about free speech rights. They've been chipped away at slowly but surely for years now. But the whole societal idea that it's okay to suppress and silence speech you disagree with but totally not okay to do the same to anybody you agree with is becoming more and more acceptable. If you don't support free speech for those you disagree with, you do not support free speech at all. That cornerstone of free speech is totally eroded. Those gullible people are being taken advantage of and encouraged and propagandized to in order to pass through laws and societal norm changes. We are not free any longer.

*I may not agree with what you say - but I will defend to the death your  right to say it*"
792,denverkris,"> Especially as an American, I’m worried that they are unknowingly chipping away at our free speech rights. 

Oh, they are definitely doing that. This is part of what's driving me away from the left. There are certainly a lot of nuts on the right, and they might say they don't like what you have to say, but you don't see a whole lot of them trying to outlaw your ability to say it."
793,politipoop,"Fuck that. Lesbians exist, you exist, and the way they’re creepily trying to shame/guilt lesbians into sleeping with males is disgusting."
794,politipoop,Why is this happening? How have we regressed so much? Women need to wake up and stick together.
795,bishhpls,"They use that masstagger app as well that flags all users of apparent 'hate subs' which is defined as basically anybody who disagrees with far left political ideology such as conservatives, Trump supporters, anyone who dares to question the trans cult, etc etc. Which clearly are not hate groups."
796,politipoop,Such irony!
797,bishhpls,"They developed it for Trump supporters iirc. They just consider anything or anyone  who disagrees with them to be spouting hate speech. Most, in fact 99%, Trump supporters are not racists or genocidal. Whereas these fuckers want to rape and exterminate us for disagreeing. There are evil members of every political group that exists."

They can go fuck themselves. Stay strong."
807,politipoop,"I really hope so. But I agree, once we wake up there is no turning back. I can’t believe that I ever was one of those people pretending that men are women, and saying that children should be abused as tortured so the can “transition”.

We need everyone to wake up fast, as it is getting way out of hand."

809,GeorgiaMRomero,"Haven’t they already chipped it?

810,06549r,TIMs tend to spend a lot of time online in general (and work in the tech field). They try to infiltrate in so many things to control from within.. twitter is one example. They even manipulate articles and highlights in the news section.
811,griffxx,There are multiple Subreddits where members are also members of T_D.
812,griffxx,"It's this whole Queer Women's perspective that homosexual Lesbians, unlike the them, don't believe the mantra ""Trans women are women."" This is a terrorible timeline for young lesbians. Lesbians realized first these were just feminized straight men."

Now I know what a load of bs that was."
817,bishhpls,"Okay and you could say that for a lot of subs though. 
It's not okay to persecute people and do the equivalent of a yellow star on the chest for following a sub."
818,politipoop,"How did we get to this point? Where lesbians are being told that they’re transphobic and bigoted for not wanting to sleep with males. It’s just wrong, and actually rape if those poor women are successfully coerced.

It’s nightmarish."
819,politipoop,"I saw it and thought the art and some memes were enjoyable, but didn’t realise how silly it really is. And you’ve really found the prefect word: silly! A bit juvenile, and feeling threatened if anyone uses the “wrong” language."
820,politipoop,Oh shit.
821,politipoop,"It is scary. It’s so weird how people with mental health problems have blackmailed us into pretending we also have those delusions. I have nothing against people with mental health problems, I’ve got plenty myself, but I don’t tell everyone else to change laws just to make me happy."
822,griffxx,All those Subreddits have members who are also members of T_D. These same members were on r/worldnews today hoping that nCoronavirus would wipeout a good portion of the Chinese population.
823,griffxx,"Because the TQ+++ coopted the LGB. This was all done with the lie of Stonewall and 2 generations of LGBTQ students indoctrinated on College and University campuses with Queer Theory and Gender Studies classes. The 2nd generation also was indoctrinated on Tumblr.

The problem with both generations is they either don't want to study LGB History or the History they are reading has been adulterated with a Transwashed Narrative."
824,bishhpls,Doesn't mean all of the people there support that and deserve to be tarred with the same brush due to the actions of a minority.
825,politipoop,"I heard that you can’t just take something like lgb history, it’s now lgbtq history or something. Like a lot of the courses are changing specifically to include this stuff."
826,griffxx,"This is a Sub for women, whose only transgressions is that they recognize the threat to their Civil Rights Movement and the strides that have been made, by Trans Identity politics. 

We don't need you here to try to state a case of T_D and not all Sub members. The corruption, graft, misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia anti-Semitism, racism and the shredding of Constitutional laws of the Trump Administration will be taught in  Political Science, Economics and History departments for decades to come."
827,griffxx,Yes they are.
828,bishhpls,"Were you paying any attention to the previous Obama administrations violations by any chance?

And I am well aware of what this sub is for, btw. I'm GC and a woman, and I contribute regularly to GC subs. And I'm not a trump supporter here to defend him, I'm simply a realist and equal opportunity political party and candidate skeptic, democrat or republican I don't trust you.

 I don't like *any* politicians. But Obama was just as bad, esp on grace violations of law and process, as well as war crimes, he was just the liberal media's golden boy and it wasn't publicised. Even though the economy was a mess. I think it's disingenuous to think Trump is the only problem and that all his supporters are pitch fork wielding racists when the same problems existed long before trump."

842,GoreVeil,"This shit is freaking me out to the point that I don't trust my own mind anymore.

915,BigYoghurt,I commented that people with penises in lesbian spaces are colonizing. The amount of sexual threats I got were appalling
916,Tangleofsnakes,"""When people recognize us as male they're literally denying our existence!! So let me make explicit implications that I want women to die."""
917,Loopylafae,"I got tossed from ask feminists for calling myself a woman's liberationist ...because describing myself accurately is ""terfy"" ffs..."
918,Lady_Montgomery,"transbians\_irl it has become. It was getting worse and worse lately. Ever since the drama with r/actualtransbians I mean lesbians. That last post about men being women, belonging in lesbian spaces, just sealed the deal for me. That sub has completely been taken over as well. Another sub where women are being excluded."
919,AsthmaticWolf,Ffs... it’s like we’re in a rejected Black Mirror episode
920,baconbitsy,Turn them in to reddit for this.  They’re ACTIVELY promoting suicide.
921,mypretties,"“MEN IN SKIRTS ARE NOT A DANGER TO WOMEN!!! ALSO, CHOKE ON MY GIRLDICK AND DIE TERF!”"
922,jericho626,Can’t you report the sub to reddit directly? Or the mods? I thought that ‘terf’ was considered hate speech now....
923,angrytardis,"Please report this to reddit admin. It might not make a difference, each individual one but it will eventually."
924,sensicalsense,I went ahead and commented too. I'll be banned I'm sure but I'm so so tired. Looks like your comment got some awards even though it's removed now
925,hedaleksa,"misogyny level 100000: being a man who thinks under any circumstance he can police women

He thinks his male fantasy of being a woman gives him a right to talk over women 

This is exactly like white people thinking reverse racism is a thing"
926,TrainingBluejay,That is exactly what you'd expect a woman who loves women to say to another woman.
927,shrek_in_me_butt,Ur comeback
928,OddOneinTheHouse,That comeback lmao
929,fanslo,I wouldn't consider that violence
930,hedaleksa,"Men behave like men no matter how much they whine that they’re women 

You can give a man materialistic stereotypes but you can’t take away his hatred of real women"
931,dedicatedgc,TIMs really love their rape threats.

934,gettheloutasia,"We have a running joke, ""everything is transphobic"", as long as they experience any kind of discomfort, it's someone else's problem, that's basically how abusers think, that people must revolve around them or there's something wrong with the other person."

936,runtis,"Same with latebloomerlesbians. I thought it was a support sub for women realising later in life that they are gay and a lot of posts are about leaving husbands and children to start a new authentic life.

But Terfs (i.e people that believe a lesbian is an adult human female) aren't welcome because transwomen are women. Transwomen are men, so WTF is the point of that sub?

Unsubscribed."
937,BigYoghurt,Where would I go to report this?
938,BigYoghurt,You can? Well it's the mods that sent me this
939,BigYoghurt,Yeah it was weird. I don't know why I got awarded. Hey we're ban buddies!
940,Lady_Montgomery,"Have encountered a TRA or 2 there too. Women who are lesbians and wouldn't ever in their right mind date a tim, cause you know they are lesbians and wouldn't date a guy, but still acknowledge them as women, and claimed I was a terf and a meanie for not seeing these poor poor babies for what they truly are, women just like you and I. :( 

But usually its just lesgals amongst each other. Yeah. Miracle that sub hasn't been reported yet and closed down, for not being inclusive."
941,baconbitsy,I usually just google “report to reddit admin” because I have trouble remembering.  Then I follow the steps.

943,angrytardis,Yes you can.
944,sensicalsense,"It's absolutely wild but while I've been downvoted to hell I have yet to be banned. I do think we should make an ""arguing with tra"" bingo board.

945,BigYoghurt,Gross. TRAs need to admit they're bisexual and leave lesbian spaces alone. Wow I hope it doesn't get shut down
946,BigYoghurt,Oh cool thanks. I'll look into it
947,BigYoghurt,Ooooh that would be fun! You could fill up the whole board with that thread alone
948,Lady_Montgomery,"They ain't bisexual, that's why they would never date a tim, because a tim isn't a woman. Yet they claim to see tims as women and that they deserve to enter women's spaces, but don't want to have anything to do with them. Mindboggling."

But never in just conversation as much as men do it. And most the time I swear I hear it just from incels."
956,Boingo0220,"Oh, and by the way, this wasn't even in a trans-related sub. It was in r/starterpacks. The topic came up because people were talking about J.K Rowling in the comments, and this TIM came in and started saying ""she's a TERF tho :'("". Someone else joined in and called us ""cunts"".

983,Glamalez,"Really? Tell me if I’m being to optimistic... Don’t you think these perverts at some point will see they will never get lesbians, and they will never be seen as real women. So at some point they have to catch on, and think it’s just not worth it. I mean even if this generation doesn’t, the younger generations have to be watching and learning. Once they notice that they (transbians) are just seen as perverts and have zero respect or credibility perhaps they won’t want to be seen that way as well. It’s like carrying a sign saying I’m a lesbian fetishist. I lurk on MTF sometimes, and I’ve seen quite a few posts lately (over the last 4 months?) from them. The posts are basically about being depressed over being seen as fetishist, or asking how they’ll know if it’s just a fetish, because they don’t want to be a fetishist. Don’t you think that will grow? Is it just my wishful thinking?"
984,YesPleaseMadam,"I don’t mean to offend but do you think pervs will wake up one day and say “ah, i’m done with the perv thing”? Of course they won’t. 

They might get discredited in as much as white guys driving white vans with no sign on them got discredited over time, but they won’t stop shaming and gaslighting women (even if they only get to do it to their mothers and possible wives). 

Mental illness when untreated only tends to become harder. Fetishes and kinks only tend to get more specific and weirder. Without proper care, by which i mean no pumping hormones and no social validation, but long hours in session to figure out how to change bad behavior and whatever therapy doctors might find that can help in the future (once they start doing their jobs of CARING for patients anyway) might help. 

I have no hope for men to just snap out of it. Don’t think you should either."
985,griffxx,"Wishful thinking. Ultimately they will be corrected by others on the thread. They have to continue to reinforce:

Trans women are women and female. If this is false, it becomes an existential Crisis."

Constantly in conversation, forcing their genitals into your mind like they want to do to your pants. Gender roles should not dictate a damn thing to anyone. They have nothing to do with anything except their own personal LARP and sexism. That is their business.  Many people in the community are GNC, and that used to be celebrated (at, you know...PRIDE). Now women need to know their place again. To be quiet and let the trans women dictate when autonomy is appropriate, or else."
1020,Randomosaur,How are lesbians a danger to trans people? It's the other way around.
1021,yesisaiditxx,Penis exclusionary lesbians would have been an oxymoron until recently. It makes me laugh just reading it. These people promote free sexuality and “boundaries” so much but you aren’t allowed to say that there’s a group of females out there who don’t want to be penetrated by a penis. Insane. No one is bugging gay men or “straight” trans women for not wanting to have sex with a “vagina haver”.

Folk is used in Doric all the time and is a gender neutral term akin to “y’all”, and I’ve had to fight folk with “please stop telling me I can’t use one of my languages just to appease random internet strangers.”

1067,Think__Critically,Oh no! I'm not vAliD? Whatever will I do?!
1068,griffxx,"I hope they put plenty of images like this in her Twitter Feed, along with the rape and death threats.

She has 14 million followers. I want them to bear witness to what we've been talking about for the last 8 years.

Here to getting TRANSPEAKED!"
1069,user875098,Entitled. Violent. Dehumanizing. Such delicate blossoms of womanhood.
1070,crispycherrypie,You know who else said a group they hated wasn’t even people? Nazis.
1071,yesisaiditxx,"Aren’t even people! I’ve been stuck in an airport with 6 delays so far this gave me the laugh I needed. I always thought the “anything you see in others is something within yourself” was wanna-be enlightened bs but it really does seem to ring true with many of their insults (not that they aren’t people, but that their idea of a trans woman who IS a female is not real)."
1072,2or3thingsIknow,It's so heart warming to know these delicate flowers are in all of our spaces.
1073,LizardsAndLimes,"Liberal women: Cis men are horrible monsters, just look at these screen shots of them saying a slur!! Evil scum!!

1081,Tweeders55,You should read today's NYT op ed regarding JK Rowling and how disappointed the TIM is who wrote it because Harry Potter helped him come out. Heartbreaking I say with lots of snark. Those poor TIMS so discriminated against and we terfs being terfs just don't understand.
1082,2or3thingsIknow,Most are trying to score woke points by being mean to women who stand up for themselves. The other ones are quiet. They are of no help either.  It's acceptable to dehumanize us. You would think the sheer amount of violent imagery and rape and death threats from trans activists would be enough. But nope. Apparently that's okay. It's really f\*\*ked up.
1083,Peakedalltohell,"It’s beyond hilarious that they consider that to be a scathing insult lmao

“You...you aren’t *valid*!  Bet that hurts!”"
1084,Cardoba,"If any woman require’s validation from a man in a dress that’s sad Lol

The male equivalent would be a woman telling a young man or boy what it means to be a man even though a woman or trans Male is the last person a young Male should ask what it means to be a man since they don’t have the male life experience only the preconceived notion of what it is. That’s why transwomen should stay quiet on women’s issues since they have no understand of what it’s like to be a woman"

1092,LizardsAndLimes,"Yes. Thank you. But this is referencing liberal women who will say ""cis men..."" in referral to how horrible none trans people are. They'll never just say ""men"" because the TRA community without fail will always reply/dm/comment ""except trans men!!"" ""*cis men"" and said liberal women being allys always go ""oh yeah my bad, im so sorry!!"""
1093,Tweeders55,"Beats me. Gandolf was gay not trans and technically wore long flowing dresses,robes and stylish hats while remaining all male."
1094,Tweeders55,Me also. I feel like a failed feminist in not knowing just how far this gone. How did this regression to if a girl prefers to wear pants and vests and comfy shoes make girls boys. How did it happen that boys who wear their hair long or like to wear dresses and make up make them girls. David Bowie died in vain obviously. The New York Dolls meant nothing. All the lesbians who broke ground for gay and women's rights are now being rewritten in history as trans as opposed to the proud women that they were. All the physical mutilation involved being encouraged for children who at 2 years of age saying they don't like their penises so girls they are lets have a national reality tv show with parents encouraging this child mutilate themselves and take testosterone blockers for most of their lives causing immense physical pain and damage to this child (Jazz Jennings) when the parents and doctors would under normal circumstances be thrown in jail and parental rights removed for obvious child abuse. It's all very disgusting and I am a Socialist. As lefty as they come. Ugh.

1098,CricketNiche,No I'm pretty sure Gandolf is the ship from Battlestar Galactica.
1099,Tweeders55,You are correct. I always mix the 2 up. I'm a boomer. So you obviously knew who I meant and what I meant. Keep laughing. Hope you're not a trans and pointing this out in good humor. I suspect not. Oh well.

1106,Tweeders55,"Yup and it was my dad's favorite. I never read it. Read the hobbit. That's as far as it went. What's with all the ""Wizard Shaming""?. Who the hell cares? Never read Harry Potter either. Saw the movies. LOTR was too long and very boring. But to each their own."

Probably doubly so for a mother who has used her female biology to give birth to such a deluded  cry-baby who likely goes on-and-on about mean women who speak for themselves. She has gone online and read everything she could get her hands on, because she is a mother and that is something we tend to do when our kids are effected by something. This post illustrates the very same male privilege that forms their expectation to be inherently 'right', and catered to, in the first place.

Why do TIMs who recognize they were born into privilege just because “penis” get dragged all over the Internet for admitting it?

I really wish people would take actual misogyny this seriously.

I hope some MUA people come check us out to learn more :)"
1211,ima-terf-im-a-weirdo,"I'm struggling to understand the actual cognitive dissonance these makeup Redditors are displaying.


If they were presented with a real woman's photo of her wearing badly-applied blue eyeliner and nothing else, the post would be very lowly upvoted/ignored, and the comments would consist of a couple of simpering words of encouragement. 


This bloke did not bother to make his eyeliner decent at all, and he's getting thousands of upvotes and women defending him! The best (worst) part is he's a blatantly obvious AGP, and I bet he's wanking to the compliments as we speak. 




I can understand if the poster had immaculately-applied eyemakeup/a completed look, sure, upvote away if there's noticeable skill and creativity, regardless of if it's a guy/girl/trans or not. I have no problem if a transwoman wants to share their makeup efforts if it's clear they put effort into it. Makeup is for everyone.



But this is just pathetic. There had to have been a trans upvote brigade sneakiness thing happening, because it seems too far out to be true."

1215,DitaVonCleese,"from what ive noticed they will praise anyone for bad makeup except the ""normies"". So if there is an 80years old lady or someone exceptionally ugly or handicapped or morbidly obese, they will get praise to no end regardless of makeup. Basically they behave to ""marginalised"" (idk how else to call them) as if they were babies in need of coddling. Which I find actually insulting towards those people."

I cannot imagine somehow getting satisfied from being patronized to.

Like yeah it's sad if some dude's dog died at 19 from old age but do people really break down crying from reading about this, when they have literally no connection to the OP? Like the compliments, it is SO fake and I wonder every time when someone puts their kid on the frontpage to whore them out for upvotes... Dude, you know it's just some neckbeards literally lying so they get a compliment next? Why do you think you need their validation?"

Even your everyday users of makeup/skin/fashion/nail polish subs have complained because being male/trans/non-binary guarantees ridiculous amounts of upvotes over ""regular"" content posted by ""regular"" users. It winds up burying posts looking for legitimate feedback under those who just want to be people to drool over them for having the *audacity* to post. Honestly, I'm surprised this particular kind of post isn't more prevalent in sub like that...but maybe posting this sort of thing in a literal circlejerk subreddit is being just a little *too* transparent about their intentions.

Someone can go on a whole rant about TERFs or share their entire trans life story and as long as they make sure to add a tiny element of the sub they're posting in, the mods can turn a blind eye because they're not technically breaking the ""must be related to the sub"" and ""no politics"" rules."

An actual lesbian that feels compelled to sleep with a a trans woman out of social pressure or for scene-cred, could sorta roll around and make out and grin-and-bear it, and get through it and get the points, but a gay male has to get it up and that’s an empirical indicator that he’s actually aroused (usually). He has to get erect and perform and, if he stays flaccid, then it’s just awkward. With radical queers, there is SO much phony bad sex going on, it hilarious.

When I used to date I was picky on who I shared myself with and just because I found people I wanted to be romantic and intimate with of both sexes doesn't mean I jumped everyone."
1348,Randomosaur,If TIMs are real women why don't they just fuck each other?

>”I’m not a man tho” 

???? what the fuck does that mean. they’re also, like, your only hope at this point if you don’t want to date another transbian or can’t guilt trip an actual lesbian. 

transbians are allowed to say they only want to date lesbians (to validate their womanhood uwu) but lesbians get shit on if they only want to date other lesbians. as a lesbian myself, i don’t necessarily agree with that line of thinking either because I think a lot of it is rooted in biphobia or fear you’ll be dumped for a man- but it does make some sense to me. lesbians are often very different from bi women and it’s nice to date someone knowing they don’t care about the male gaze or men in general. The best relationships I’ve had have been with other lesbians and febfems (female exclusive bisexual women.)"
1353,DimDroog,"Lesbians not having sex with men is bigotry now.

Why don't they just date each other, since TWAW?"

1363,VoiceOfTheMillenium,">If genitalia doesn’t matter at all

I've noticed that people like them have really funny and confusing definition of sexual attraction that they themselves can't explain properly in the politically correct way.
That's why they pretend that genitalia doesn't matter as if you should be ready to do the dirty just because ""you have a Personality™"". In other words, they pretend to be that dirty adult horny lovable things while most of them wouldn't go further than holding hands - that's why the whole idea of genitals actually mattering frightens them.

Funniest thing is when these people constantly confuse friendship and brotherhood/sisterhood with ""awww they love each other and are totally gay"".
And this screwed up fairytale view on friendship and sex is considered a norm."

1374,notkeenonmen,"Oops! That’s the real problem when we get down to it. Even the best surgeries and results of hormones won’t change all that much, and they certainly won’t erase the years of male socialization that make most men truly unappealing to be around."
1375,,sorry!
1376,hedaleksa,"I don’t know why they don’t get that? I had one last week tell me I should be dragged into a van and raped by a gang of black men. It’s like clearly can’t erase the little man you truly are. (Not to mention racist on top of it) I have never met a woman who would ever say that to another woman no matter how much she dislikes the other. 

They think some wildly insulting changes in mannerisms is the same as being a woman, underneath it all they’re still the same person."
1377,notkeenonmen,"That’s horrifying and disgusting! How are they so blind to see that saying such vile things is classic misogyny and typical male violence? I’m so sorry you had to deal with that. 

I’ve seen a lot of shit about “femme” solidarity coming from trans women, basically saying that women and trans women need to work together to defeat male evil- saying that trans men are just as guilty as bio men and they always benefit from male privilege! 

like shut the hell up, I will always have more in common with a trans man than I will ever have with a dude doing a poor impression of what they think “womanhood” is. I have solidarity with WOMEN not your fetish or half-assed attempt. Quite amusing that they think walking around in a dress with shaky eyeliner will ever even give them a hint of what life is like for females, much less opt into our oppression. Shows how little they empathize."
1378,AutoModerator,"Welcome to r/terfisaslur. 

What is a ""TERF""? While ""TERF"" is supposed to stand for ""Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist,"" the people called ""TERF"" generally are neither radical feminists nor ""trans exclusionary,"" and in practice the term has become a slur. [More info.](https://redd.it/70cyzm)

We're documenting hateful rhetoric directed at lesbians, radical feminists, gender critical feminists, and others on Reddit and beyond.

If you're curious about why certain trans activists are clashing with some feminists, see [these resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/wiki/resources#wiki_great_resources_for_people_new_to_gender_critical_feminism) from r/GenderCritical.

1394,QueenRowana,"I see the most noticeable difference between TiM and TiF being that:

Trans'men' want all transmen to be seen as men. They want to assimilate into maleness. Even though they can obviously never truly be male, they try their very best to be as true to a real man as they can manage.



Trans'women' want all women to be seen as transwomen. They are not interested in assimilating into femaleness but instead want femaleness to change to fit them. They don't even try to be as female as they could possibly be, instead they cosplay and make a mockery of femaleness. But somehow they are the true women, not us.

They want to push real women out of femaleness and take our place.


Yes, TiF's and TiM's are both wrong and mistaken, Yes, Neither of them can ever be what they want to be, Yes, both will still always be the sex they were born as. But of the two groups it is clear the TiM's are the more dangerous group."

1400,baconbitsy,"**UPDATE** - In messaging with Reddit, basically, they don’t ban particular words.  *BUT* they look at the entire context and can ban a user for threats of violence or bullying/harassment.  It’s my understanding that if a person is using the term in a way that violates content policy, action will be taken.  And Reddit will look at the entire conversation.   **_KEEP REPORTING_**



*original post*

Don’t forget to report them to reddit proper - calling someone a TERF isn’t allowed


EDIT:  apparently this got reversed.  Which means we need to continue to report its usage against us.  When reporting, cite that the term incites violence.

I’ve also directly messaged the head of reddit security asking for further review of the policy as it is a slur that incites violence against women, and makes us fearful of speaking out.  That a quick search of Twitter for “rape TERF” “kill TERF” “punch TERF” yields many examples of the term’s usage to be violent against anyone associated with the term.

I will not stop fighting this."
