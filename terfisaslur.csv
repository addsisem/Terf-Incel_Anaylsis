What is a ""TERF""? While ""TERF"" is supposed to stand for ""Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist,"" the people called ""TERF"" generally are neither radical feminists nor ""trans exclusionary,"" and in practice the term has become a slur. [More info.](https://redd.it/70cyzm)

We're documenting hateful rhetoric directed at lesbians, radical feminists, gender critical feminists, and others on Reddit and beyond.

1,GenderIsntCritical,"They can change their hair or what they wear, but no matter what they do, a man is still a man"
2,WikiMB,That explains how much violent the response for any skepticism regarding transgenderism is. And because of it I either hide or use my alt account to rise my voice on topics like these.
3,Killy00013,Am I misreading this? It sounds like she doesn't belive both sides behave badly calling it a fallacy and also seems to support jk rowling by saying that those who send her death and rape threats arent women
4,maat89,And I opp....
5,Tulcey-Lee,"I had an account locked yesterday on twitter. Unable to have a discussion with said person as they resorted to calling me a bitch and a terf and then the rape threats started. How is it now we live in a world where you can‚Äôt disagree anymore? Your opinion means you are fine to be harassed and threatened. 
I stated biology and that women don‚Äôt have a penis and there was no coherent argument just abuse."
6,Cha-Challenger,"They can change their name or what they call themselves, but no matter what they do, a terf is still a terf. (Ironic huh)"
7,qsims,She doesn‚Äôt she‚Äôs pointing out how bullshit the claim is
8,Cha-Challenger,What did you do to cause this? Can you link the thread?
9,Killy00013,"she forgot to put /s then, I hate when people are sarcastic online, I usually cant tell because nowdays you can say the most fcked up things and actually mean them"
10,Tulcey-Lee,"They said some
Women have penis‚Äôs and I said no they don‚Äôt."
11,qsims,But she‚Äôs not being sarcastic..?
12,Killy00013,"if she isnt sarcastic then she sounds like she is on jk's side, that's how i see it"
13,qsims,I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt understand how?
14,2or3thingsIknow,They simply do not care. Because of all the social capital they have they are literally acting like terrorists and slamming women all over the place.
15,baconbitsy,"Honey, the amount of people who use ‚ÄúTERF‚Äù to stop a discussion is ridiculous.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna debate you because you‚Äôre a TERF!‚Äù followed by a lot of nonsensical insults just proves what they really are: misogynists."
16,Vibrosphere,You're invalidating the women who menstruate by sticking tomato juice Popsicles in their recta and collecting the meltjuice with tampons and menstrual pads.
17,Simone_Auclert,If you're woman who acknowledges reality you're a terf.
18,,[removed]
19,Cha-Challenger,First off all they're not saying MtFs can have periods. They're saying FtMs can still have periods post transition.
20,mypretties,"They have a ton of time of their hands since 99% of society wants nothing to do with them.

TIMs: ‚ÄúI can be a normal man and go out and achieve a good life for myself or I can sit in my mom‚Äôs basement, shriek TERF at her if she questions me stealing my sister‚Äôs panties, eat cheetos, stick tomato juice up my ass and mod r/actuallesbians. Hmmm gonna have to go with choice #2!‚Äù"
21,stargazer612,Oh dear gawd is this a thing????
22,TheCatsEyeNebula,A few months and they'll use this as an arguement.
23,BellejarredDylan,But testosterone stops periods. So Ftm shouldn't be having them
24,Vibrosphere,"You know I want to go shake my finger at the youth and yell at them to GTFO my lawn but a lot of the most egregious TIMs are men older than myself (41)

Like, bro, you should know better."
25,Vibrosphere,Well documented.
26,Idkjustgotquestions,Depends for some it takes a while for it to take effect and some aren‚Äôt on hormone replacement yet.
27,insomniac29,I know an FTM that sometimes gets periods for missing hormone doses. A lot of trans people don‚Äôt have regular access to treatment. They‚Äôre saving up for a hysterectomy. Or technically someone who hasn‚Äôt started treatment yet or for some reason doesn‚Äôt want medical treatment could identify as trans.
28,stargazer612,Just researched and will now scrub my browser history. Omg
29,BellejarredDylan,Im still going to only say women have periods
30,insomniac29,"Okay that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm just responding to your post saying that an FTM can‚Äôt have a period, they sometimes do."
31,girl_undone,Locked because this is still getting brigaded a month later.

37,erin93,This is beautifully written. Thank you for sharing!
38,beccagrubb,"Great post, thanks for sharing."
39,sailornptn,Bless you a thousand times. People like you made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt crazy for thinking this way.
40,QueenRowana,Oh and welcome to our guests from the GenderCynical sub who love me so much for standing up for women and who absolutely adore how i want nothing to do with their genderconfused angershouts.

51,sarahkate2011,Karma whoring at its finest.
52,QueenRowana,"What we want if for men to stay out of womens spaces. Simple. Fighting for women is a good thing. If that means some men get their little girl panties (that they love wearing so much) in a twist. I ain‚Äôt upset. And if they want to use slurs and threaten us while doing it. Well thats hurtful but still inconsequential. Because that report button isn‚Äôt just decorative.  I‚Äôm standing up for women so men, yeah i dont care if you chop off your dick or wear a dress and makeup.  They‚Äôre never gonna be a woman. 
Have a lovely day!"
53,QueenRowana,"I love that this is still pissing men off almost a month later. Men who, by the way, are not and never will be women. Sorry you have no life. Big F (whatever that means)"
54,QueenRowana,I don‚Äôt think i understand what you mean?
55,QueenRowana,"Right so how much of that post did you read and how long have the Tims been whispering in your ear? 

Women‚Äôs spaces should be for women and women only. These weirdos in wigs and dresses are not and can never be women. No matter how badly they mutilate their genitals. I will not bow down to their behavior and i will not accept insults from ‚Äúallies‚Äù like you.  You contribute to a system that demeans women and denies us our existence. A system that doesn‚Äôt even allow lesbian her sexuality anymore. A system where a male mediocre weightlifter can decide today that he is a woman and start winning gold medals in women‚Äôs classifications tomorrow. 

Terf is a foul slur usually accompanied by threats of beatings, rapes and murder to women who refuse to cater to men‚Äôs fragile ego‚Äôs and most notably their autogynephila and fetishes. 
I refuse to be called names by woke weirdos like you who think women should die when all we want is to make men get out of our faces, out of our sports and out of out bathrooms. We dont want them to die, we want them to act like a normal human being. Not a anime doll. But you just echo what they teach you. 

Next time you call someone trash please re-read this message and realize i could have just insulted you right back. But i didnt do that. Now try and see who is the one between us two capable of calm and rational thought and who has used cursewords as their only retort to a woman standing up for herself."
56,QueenRowana,"They‚Äôre men. The text says nothing about qualification. I wouldnt want to be treated by an unqualfied woman either. But i dint want to be cared for by a man perion.  These are men, not ‚Äútrans women!?!!‚Äù And yes they are attempting to steal women only spaces. They are men. It‚Äôs their ultimate goal it seems."
57,QueenRowana,Correct i didn‚Äôt write it. But i had not seen it on this sub before and loved it. I agree with it completely. Men can get the hell out if womens spaces. They are not welcome. And diaper fetishists too by the way sir!
58,auklet,"Terf is used as a slur, by trans rights activists. You'll often hear it in phrases such as ""kill all terfs.""  I think many ""terfs"" agree that ""terf""  is an accurate term when used to mean ""woman who doesn't agree that a man can become a woman."" But trans activists use it to mean, ""Person who refuses to validate my claim to be a woman and therefore should be humiliated, ostracized, and murdered. """

64,kaladinner,"Gotcha, thanks. Are the majority of you also sex-worker exclusionary as well? If you remove delusions of infinite genders, and hedonistic pornographer women being glorified, then I can get behind feminism. I mean, I'm still gonna call obese, dyed haired women ""SJWs""; and I'm sure as hell not denying that men are biologically stronger than women, but other non-sexually-immoral ideologies you guys hold are fine by me."
65,QueenRowana,"I‚Äôm not against normal men who mind their own business at all. Men can be great. I‚Äôm only against trans people if they are men trying to get away with stuff and get into female spaces by wearing dresses and turning their penis inside out or even just claiming they are women while they arent even remotely trying, they are literally just men. I have little to no trouble with women who try to become men. They don‚Äôt bother me usually. I say good luck to them. They are still weird but I wish them luck fitting in with men. But men trying to be women. Yeah i have something against them and i will fight against them and for women.  

Every day. 

Again. Have a nice day."
66,QueenRowana,"I didnt write it. I do agree with it though. 

I never said YOU were a man. I just said ‚Äòmen‚Äô but if you felt like i was talking about you go off i guess. 

And are you sure you‚Äôre a woman. Isn‚Äôt that enforcing a gender binary which could hurt trans peoples feelings? (Big sarcasm in case you didn‚Äôt get that)"
67,QueenRowana,"I am indeed not bothered at all by that. Because i care about women and preserving our spaces, not about the fragile ego‚Äôs of men who like to wear dresses and want to be called ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù"
68,QueenRowana,That dont mean it‚Äôs untrue though. Men with a trans fetish are a danger to women. Whether i wrote it or not doesnt make it false.
69,auklet,"Radical feminists,  ftom what I read, see ""sex work"" including porn as exploitative."
70,girl_undone,"It's a misnomer to say feminists are ""excluding"" ""sex workers"" when we say that the men who rape and sell women in sexual slavery and prostitution are horrible and shouldn't be able to do that."

Lol. It‚Äôs 50% ‚Äúgrr i‚Äôm not allowed in womens [fill in here: bathroom, locker room, rape shelter, prison] Let‚Äôs put on a dress and waltz in, no one will dare stop me‚Äù. These are predators out to get weak women and many cases are documented of  so called ‚Äútrans women‚Äù (men) getting permission to go to female prision instead of male and at the very least creeping the fuck out of vulnerable women and at worst rape and hurt them. Many cases about men freaking out for not being admitted to women rape shelters. Cases of men sendingvdeath threats to lesbians who refuse to fuck men with dicks. Of pedophiles who claim to be trans to get lowered sentences. Of men going Into womens bathrooms with ugly dresses and terrible fake wigs just for fun and to terrify women in a space where once they would have come to get away from men. 

And 50% ‚Äú i just want to have tits to play with and be submissive slut in bed‚Äù. Of which the last one i will admit are usually not quite as nefarious. But they‚Äôre definitely AGP."
75,QueenRowana,"Fetish? Lol i have literally 0 fetishes.  Your ‚Äútendencies‚Äù are a fetish. 
I care about women enough to not want men with dicks forcing themselves into lesbian spaces, into women rape shelters, into womens locker rooms, toilets and prisons.  If your main objective is forcing women to just lie down and take it while men like you walk all over them you are not a feminist."
76,,[removed]
77,QueenRowana,"Fascination with ‚Äúlady dick‚Äù? I have never used that word except to express my disgust at the word. Maybe you mistook my disgusted frustration at men referring to penises as a ‚Äúgirldick‚Äù for fascination, HalfBreed?

Men like you saying stuff like ‚Äòkill terfs‚Äô are inciting violence against women yet somehow i‚Äôm the one who doesnt care about women? Thats cute dude! Such a male thing to do!
Hope you have a great day!"

Oh I'm sorry the rape crisis center was defunded by a man, but I hope you understand it's because those women were bigots for wanting to heal privately and with dignity. Their wants outweigh your needs, because as a woman, you are everything they wish they were. This is ""privledge"", not objectification. 

Oh I'm so so sorry to hear you didnt place in your sport after training your whole life because men now compete in womens sports. But the fact they get the limited scholarships and opportunities for women, should really be an inspiration for you to just work harder and be quietly supportive.

Oh I'm so so VERY sorry that abortions are punishable by a life sentence in certain states and getting harder and harder to access, but it seems so exclusionary since transwomen dont get to experience this, so we shouldn't focus on it. The most important thing is that everything is about transwomen all the time. If it's not, then it's about how it hurts them that it's not, and THAT is the important peice of every puzzle.

So it just a waiting game for now.
294,Lady_Montgomery,"When you think you are the opposite sex you are most definitely mentally ill. Its like saying you are born in the wrong body and that you are an alien from galaxy 1000 miles away. It's not real. It's a mask for something else. A personality disorder, childhood trauma, even trauma in later life, autism, internalized homophobia, internalized misogyny, plain old misogyny (when it comes to men claiming to be women) etc. It's a symptom. Not an actual thing. But it's also a multi billion business that preys on the unstable. As long as there are people that can make a shit load of money on the mentally disturbed they will. Providing actual help doesn't make people as much money. And as long as people sign a contract that says informed consent, they can actually get away with it. It's vile and grotesque.

Every single person that claims to be of the opposite gender is at least highly mentally unstable and often times mentally ill."

303,Eowyn19,Exactly what I was thinking. It‚Äôs already happened. Hardly any libfems even know about trans criminals because discussing them is ‚Äúliterally violence‚Äù.
304,0WatcherintheWater0,"You seem to not understand modern gender theory. What makes someone a certain gender is a combination of three things. 1) identity (what gender you see yourself as), 2) body (what physical characteristics society prescribes to different genders), and 3) presentation (what behaviors are prescribed to certain genders, an example would be gender roles). You‚Äôll notice that chromosomes have nothing to do with it. So long as Trans people fit two out of those three things, they **are** the opposite gender, your opinion on the subject is irrelevant.  They aren‚Äôt mentally ill. Gender dysphoria still is a mental illness, of course, but for separate reasons, and a lot of trans people aren‚Äôt dysphoric.

Also, it‚Äôs not a mask, sure there are trans people who change in order to cover up past trauma, but the vast majority are sincere in their beliefs. 

May I ask, what do you think would actually help trans people beyond surgery? Therapy wouldn‚Äôt do anything beyond maybe making them more suicidal, that‚Äôs for sure."
305,FTThrowAway123,"Report to the [FBI](https://tips.fbi.gov/). You can submit a tip online. I've submitted tips twice before. Both times an agent called me back promptly and seemed to take it seriously.  

Also, the [U.S. Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/how-do-i/report-suspicious-activity) has suggestions.  

>""If You See Something, Say Something¬Æ"" is a national campaign that raises public awareness of the indicators of terrorism and terrorism-related crime, as well as the importance of reporting suspicious activity to state and local law enforcement.  

I'll be reporting to both. This is above Reddits paygrade, nor do I trust them to actually do anything about it."
306,2or3thingsIknow,"Yep, he's a real psycho that one."
307,Lady_Montgomery,"I heard all that bs before and it's a cry for attention. There males and females. Gender roles are bs. Chromosomes determine your sex, which equals your gender. The end. Basic biology. So called trans people need psychological help to determine what is truly the matter with them: a personality disorder, autism, trauma (sexual or other wise), internalized homophobia/misogyny. The only reason it isn't qualified as a mental disorder officially is because it has become a multi billion industry. The profits made to mutilate so called transgenders are so incredibly high. So of course they want the medical world to say its okay and normal. Trans people do not exist. It's as simple as that. A d you know it too else you wouldn't be commenting here. You are looking for validation from people who are telling you the truth. If you can convince us, you can convince yourself. I wish you the best. And I hope you find proper help to help you with either you personality disorder or your past trauma you haven't dealt with yet. Good luck.

BTW if you aren't dysphoric, no need to mutilate your body either and pump it full with hormones your body isnt meant to produce. You know doing that when you aren't dysphoric doesn't make sense."

312,user875098,"This is one of the most disgusting things I‚Äôve ever seen. Threatening and harassing women who have already been traumatized because they don‚Äôt want another male predator in their fucking rape shelter. Oger is a first class narcissistic, misogynistic creep who should be shamed instead of applauded."
313,tireddandelion,Note: The Rape Relief Women‚Äôs Shelter was defunded because of these men.
314,girl_undone,A few months old but I wanted to sticky something about this.
315,GeorgiaMRomero,"No outrage from the woke, I presume."
316,aquametalmermaid,"deplorable. :( one of my old lib fem friends who devotes her life to being a TRA used to live in Vancouver and vacations there regularly. sounds like a beautiful city, so what an absolute shame to see lib fems terrorize the place. I hope all the women using this shelter and/or their services are kept safe."
317,Randomosaur,This makes me wish for a mass extinction.
318,ciaokhan,"Creeping through their subs, they still believe it's their god given right to be in shelters and centers. 

How fucking barbaric and narcissistic must you be to demand services that push out the original sex it was meant for."
319,meow_thug,I was so brainwashed by TRAs up until a few months ago that this wasn't even my peak moment. Truly unbelievable. And lib fems don't have a fucking thing to say when I use this example of why exclusivity is paramount for women's spaces.
320,bishhpls,"If something sums up these people's utter hatred and contempt for women, this is it. The fact they are demanding women who have been traumatised by men and their male bodies allow them into the one space that is meant to be totally free of those traumatic elements, simply to validate their 'true and honest womanhood' is nothing short of horrifying. If a literal rape crisis centre isn't safe, where is?

They want to allow men who have a sexual fetish regarding objectifying women into a slew of outdated sexist stereotypes into a place where women are healing from sexual trauma. Where they will most likely exude exhibitionism and sexually harass these vulnerable women. All for sexual gratification and their own validation. TIMs claim to need these centres, and some may, but I believe the number of them that truly need shelter may be quite low and the rest are just creepy boundary pushing AGPs. Yet when they are offered separate accommodations away from the women, that just isn't good enough, they must be treated as exactly the same as a biological woman, even though they are NOT the same and belong to the group who victimised the women in the first place. That tells you all you need to know. They do not care about the actual shelter, they just care they're not included and not being constantly validated. So selfish."

Until the day you die and forever afterward you'll be a woman with short hair, an intentional chemical imbalance and depending on your personal decisions extensive plastic surgery and body modifications. You're not a man. You can scream it as loudly as you like, but it won't make reality any different. You don't want to be a woman, I get that. I can't blame you. The world can be kinda shitty for us. However, you can't just opt-out of reality. I can say I‚Äôm a walrus --but if I show up on a beach none of the other walruses are going to be particularly impressed me and zero percent of them will buy it. As for the rest of what I wrote, the concept remains the same so I don't see a point in editing it. 

( Correction: in order to not feed into delusional thinking I did indeed edit pronouns in my previous comment in order to reflect reality.) 

You understood it clearly enough. You don't have to be a girly girl, you can have short hair, you can have your breasts removed--you can take hormones if you want because its your body and you can do what you want with it --but how you express your personal aesthetics has exactly zero impact on biological fact.  You're still a woman and the rest of the world has no obligation to play along with your fantasy. You need to accept who you actually are, a non conformist  woman, instead of making up a whole new person to distance yourself from the things you dislike about the world and your body."

What is a ""TERF""? While ""TERF"" is supposed to stand for ""Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist,"" the people called ""TERF"" generally are neither radical feminists nor ""trans exclusionary,"" and in practice the term has become a slur. [More info.](https://redd.it/70cyzm)

We're documenting hateful rhetoric directed at lesbians, radical feminists, gender critical feminists, and others on Reddit and beyond.

If you're curious about why certain trans activists are clashing with some feminists, see [these resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/wiki/resources#wiki_great_resources_for_people_new_to_gender_critical_feminism) from r/GenderCritical.

469,protozoanpussy,"I really wish someone had this conversation with me when I was 12. I spent my young teenage years exposing myself to older men online and feeling so cool for it. I‚Äôm currently in an extremely toxic relationship with a man 30 years my senior. The damage I‚Äôve caused myself is probably irreparable. I don‚Äôt feel empowered, I feel used and silly."
470,fogellegof,Lol implicitly this means that TiMs are predators.
471,,I wish I‚Äôd had older and wiser women to help me to navigate the dating world when I was young and dumb(er). I‚Äôd have avoided several toxic relationships and probably wouldn‚Äôt have been sexually assaulted.
472,MadSeaPhoenix,Kind of glad as it‚Äôs making the word lose its efficacy.
473,moonflower,"I think perhaps the accusation of being 'terfs' wasn't based on that comment, but on previous comments not shown here - this looks like a grudge carried over from another conversation"

480,MonoRubric,You are never damaged for being exploited.
481,EgregiousWeasel,"You aren't damaged. You're not ""irreparable."" It's never too late to start being kinder to yourself. Can you leave this relationship safely? You're too precious to waste any more time with this man."
482,LesbianPrincess-,They are
483,,"tbh i've finally had this coalesce in my mind and i've been trying to bring it up at every opportunity. the \*mere engagement in trans identification\* is abusive because it is \*gaslighting\*. I have not seen \*one\* man in a dress who doesn't engage in the abusive factors of 1) denying reality (with the expectation that those he demands deny it as well) and 2) threatening violence (on himself or others) when or even just at the possibility that people don't comply with his demands of reality denial. (Threats to 't\*rfs' or 'transphobes' and threats to himself through threatening suicide or implying that not denying reality will force others to kill themselves.) 

&#x200B;

i now believe (and have seen no evidence otherwise) that these men who ""identify as women"" are unilaterally abusers, because at the bare minimum their gaslighting is abusive. with abuse comes predatory behavior, and thank you for saying this because i had not thought about that aspect of it too. the more time i spend here and on sister subs and read news articles (like the [recent win by a young man with pink hair to have unrestricted access to all the masturbatory aid he needed in the form of real live uncensored vulnerable teenage women](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/11/14/palatine-schaumburg-high-school-district-votes-to-give-transgeder-students-unrestricted-locker-room-access/)) the more i am convinced that every single one is a narcissistic abusive predator."
484,LesbianPrincess-,"I know that feeling and can SO relate, but please don‚Äôt blame yourself. On the plus side, at least we can warn other women now :) Especially younger ones. Let‚Äôs use that wisdom to protect other women <3 Even though it came at a shitty cost."
485,LesbianPrincess-,"So? I see this wayyyyyyy too much on tumblr. It‚Äôs ridiculous. People will call women ‚Äúterfs‚Äù all the time in an attempt to disprove our points. It‚Äôs still just as bad. 

But honestly I have seen people calling this stuff terfy, especially when we talk about patriarchy. Because calling out patriarchy and men‚Äôs oppression of women is offensive to TIMs."

496,2or3thingsIknow,This. They 100% are. They like being abusive males.
497,,Thank you <3 You‚Äôre right
498,SometimesJacka,"So true. 

In addition because there are less boundaries between the communities they get really paranoid and start flagging any sort of woman centered content as ‚Äòterf-y‚Äô. Too much of social faux pas for them to be caught anywhere near ‚Äòterf‚Äô content or people. 

It‚Äôs funny when the opposite happens ‚Äî rad fems reblogging TRA or QT content. The notes on those posts are just hilarious. Rad fems acknowledge good posts regardless of the poster, so not only do TRAs / QT have to be careful about who they follow and what they reblog, they have to make sure their content doesn‚Äôt appeal to radical feminists either. 


But yes the witch hunts for ‚Äòterfs‚Äô on tumblr is a real thing."
499,2or3thingsIknow,This guy thinks trans males can gestate babies. Just an FYI. Seems to dislike actual feminists.
500,moonflower,Because your title implied that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc - but I think the person who called them 'terfs' was very likely referring back to a previous discussion
501,moonflower,You lost me - I don't know who you are criticising - the OP here or the commenter in the linked page ...?

I was in radfem tumblr, and below these comments there were radfems/women calling him out. But I could only fit so much into a screenshot. 

Radfem tumblr is the best tumblr! So much wisdom there. & REALLY cool, smart, brilliant, hilarious women. It feels like a true sisterhood. Pretty inspiring actually. <3

Explains the fragile ego, the need to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù women, the incessant arguing, refusal to admit that he‚Äôs wrong and doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about, etc."
507,olatundew,"At best, this makes the accusation of TERF foolish and strategically misguided. We don't know if there was prior context, but we *do* know that they chose to spin off the wording used in the previous comment."
508,LesbianPrincess-,Nah. Lol
509,,The commenter in the linked page. It was a post about girls being taken advantage of. You‚Äôd have to be a special kind of asshole to derail that to point out a ‚Äúterf‚Äù
510,LesbianPrincess-,You commented on my post. üòπüòπ Thank you! That‚Äôs a compliment.
511,2or3thingsIknow,Looks that way. Posts on GenderCriticalGuys (gets almost no upvotes).
512,moonflower,"Yes, but that's another issue. Are you disagreeing with anything I said?"
513,moonflower,"You said: ""Mentioning anything about patriarchy, exploitation and trauma are ‚Äòterfy‚Äô now"" ... how is that *not* implying that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc?

You're denying what's right in front of you and laughing about it."
514,moonflower,"Oh yes, of course it was inappropriate, but the point I was making was that the accusation of 'terf' probably wasn't based on those comments - and we already know that people who use 'terf' as a derogatory term wouldn't be interested in discussing anything about how to protect female people, so they probably didn't even think about the current discussion, only concerned about silencing 'terfs'"
515,,[removed]
516,LesbianPrincess-,"Gee, I wonder why! What a loser lol. He should be banned from this subreddit. I reported the rude comments but maybe mods haven‚Äôt gotten to them yet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
517,olatundew,"Well, if we're splitting hairs, I disagree that it's ""very likely"" that this was in response to a previous comment.

More to the point, I do think that this part of the same issue - how do we have constructive conversations about complicated gender issues?"
518,LesbianPrincess-,"What exactly am I denying? I‚Äôm just disagreeing with you. 

Honestly, you‚Äôve been very rude to me in the past and I would like to be done with this convo. I actually know how tumblr works and this stuff is all too common. Plus there are too many users on there for there to be people who remember users‚Äô ‚Äúprior terfy conversations‚Äù or whatever. Men call us terfs for being feminists. Period. 

Bye.

Edit: Apparently the person I'm talking to is a MALE! What a surprise. Dominating the conversation and telling women that we don't know what we're talking about. He should be banned. Mansplaining at its finest, and he has the audacity to call himself a feminist. Wow."
519,,"Exactly, so that person is a trash gremlin regardless of what they were referencing. So it doesn't really matter."
520,LesbianPrincess-,"üòπüòπüòπ We get it, you‚Äôre insecure and projecting because of your small penis. Bye."
521,moonflower,"Do you really think it is at all likely that this person called them 'terfs' based solely on those comments, with no previous history between them?"
522,moonflower,"You are denying that your title implies that they were being called 'terfs' due to those specific expressed views on casual sex etc.

Also, how ironic that you complain of people who judge current comments based on prior conversations, at the same time as you are doing that exact same thing to me - you are the one who is being rude here, and rude in the past - way ruder than I have ever been to you.

I disagree with things that you say, and call you out on your bad behaviour, and you interpret that as ''rudeness'' and use it as an excuse to be even more rude to me."
523,moonflower,I think it does matter if OP is misrepresenting the situation
524,2or3thingsIknow,"Yes, because that is what these clownfish do. They label anything and everything terf because they cannot answer. Stop pretending you haven't seen this."
525,olatundew,"That's a slightly different claim from the original one, but yes - I've seen TERF used in some pretty atrocious ways (e.g. ""I'm going to rape you, you fucking TERF"") so I wouldn't rule it out. Plus, this particular comment they were responding to was purposeful and well-written, and seemed to be the beginning of a new conversation - so it seems a non-sequiter for it to have been part of an ongoing (quite bitter) dialogue."
526,LesbianPrincess-,"I‚Äôm not denying it. My ‚ÄúNah. Lol‚Äù was just dismissing what you were saying. 

I‚Äôm just saying I don‚Äôt have time to argue with you when you‚Äôve been rude in the past. Move along. Blocking you because I don‚Äôt have time for this weird drama. Lol. And not sure what ‚Äúbad behavior‚Äù you‚Äôre referencing. Pretty weird."
527,,There's no actual evidence that the situation is being misrepresented though???
528,moonflower,Actually I have never seen anyone called a 'terf' unless they have said something which suggests that they believe that male people cannot become female
529,moonflower,I don't really understand your reasoning at all - I came to the opposite conclusion based on exactly the same perception that it was a new conversation and *therefore* inappropriate to be calling anyone 'terfs' in response to the subject matter - much more likely that the person calling them 'terfs' was referring to a different conversation
530,moonflower,"OK, we'll see if you really do block me - perhaps that means I will be free to speak my views in future without you being rude and denying reality all over my comments eh"
531,moonflower,"Not on the linked page, no, but I think it's very likely that the accusation of 'terf' was in reference to a previous encounter and not based on the shown comments"
532,2or3thingsIknow,Male people are male people. Not female. Males. Stop fucking colonizing us you sick bastards. I'm done playing nice with you creeps.
533,olatundew,"That's because we're talking about two different scenarios. I'm saying this doesn't look like an out-of-context snippet of conversation, you're saying it does look like there is a background context to their relationship. Both could be true, or neither."
534,,[deleted]
535,zombieeezzz,Holy shit. Shut up. You keep repeating this point and no one cares.
536,,You think it‚Äôs very likely. Which means you have no actual evidence and all of the drama you‚Äôre causing about this is based on nothing but a hunch that nobody even cares about.

The other day I posted a commented empathizing with a woman female or trans I don‚Äôt know) who said she had been sexually assaulted and wanted to know if others thought she should report the friend who attacked her. Others said to report her rapist. I was empathic and also said that if she didn‚Äôt report him he would go on to rape other women. I finished with something like ‚ÄúThink of your sisters‚Äù. 

Some trans person must have looked at my profile or recognized my Reddit name and screamed at me online about having no right to comment, I was a pretend feminist, etc. 

Unfuckingbelievable!  Nothing I said was particularly feminist. It was just one woman empathasizing with the suffering of another woman at the hands of a man who attacked her. One human being reaching out to comfort another. 

The person who reacted so badly to not being centered in that moment was a man larping as a woman and doing it badly because he failed Female Bonding 101. 

He‚Äôs a man because his rage at me was so disproportionate to my comment and to the tone of the comment (empathy and sisterly advice which the woman asked for). 

He‚Äôs a man because he immediately jumped to who owns feminism when that wasn‚Äôt the topic. 

He‚Äôs a man because if it isn‚Äôt about him he can‚Äôt be quiet or move along. 

He‚Äôs a man because maybe the topic of sexual assault, rape, and friends who are attackers hit to close to home so he had to derail the thread."

597,griffxx,"Correction: Bardfinn Yeah, but he's been here since Reddit began. So it's sort of a big deal. Also the co-conspirator with MollyMollyKelKel and the ""GC brigaded AL"" lie."

What is a ""TERF""? While ""TERF"" is supposed to stand for ""Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist,"" the people called ""TERF"" generally are neither radical feminists nor ""trans exclusionary,"" and in practice the term has become a slur. [More info.](https://redd.it/70cyzm)

599,moonflower,Well he's right - there is no place in the modern feminist movement for female people who don't submit to the male people who are now in charge of it
600,Revstokely,The liberal feminist ideal: A white male.
601,PsychicCaramelle,The fucking nerve of these stupid men.
602,,Imagine knowing this guy irl. Insufferable.
603,Terf_Force_One,"Whoes a good little ""male feminist"" with pronouns in his name? 

Who do they think they are lecturing to women what feminism should be?"
604,BoobDoodles,"Men can‚Äôt be feminists. They can support feminists, be an ally to feminists (preferably by leading by example in treating women with respect, being anti rape, etc), but the struggle is ours alone."
605,,"Who handed out all the Women club cards to men? Where can I find the woman that okay‚Äôd   males to  dictate feminism?
What  happen to this movement?  Why do  these males  think this is remotely acceptable? 
All was good when I left activism  in 2012, back when everyone knew what a woman was  and we had men starting to  try to be decent people ... but look where we are now? 
Men such as these should be receiving a verbal smackdown to remind them of their place before Our foremothers roll out of their graves in contempt for whatever this is going on because this male is not a feminist. 
Also:They call us trans exclusionary but fail to realize we aren‚Äôt excluding trans men (AFABs), we exclude males and  the LadyDique owners  because males have no place in feminism outside of  standing in solidarity with us and being allys.

Edit: To the kind strange who gave me a gold award many thanks be upon you. May the universe treat you favourably"
606,burntmatchesburn3x,"Haha, look at this this sad, irrelevant little chode. He'll get his... and that ""AS A MALE"". Like we couldn't spot your scrawny ass a mile off?

For those in the back: MEN CANNOT BE FEMINISTS. EVER, EVER, EVER."
607,BoobDoodles,I see what you did there.
608,MaxinistaFemmeinista,Definitely a *checks notes* white male.
609,fulloftrivia,"I know 0, I think they put so much time on the net on  they make it seem common. 

I know a dude personally that started and runs well over 300 subreddits (not much gender related stuff).

He's an oddball with a big internet presence, but is a weak poor man IRL. He also operates on other websites, he has no life outside of his preaching and online activism.

MtF dudes vs women in sports doesn't fly in any of Reddit's regular sports related subs, you can see that. Unlike a lot of Reddit subs, they're not modded by propagandists censoring away dissent."
610,EgregiousWeasel,"It's because women started trying to placate men by saying that feminism can help them too, by discouraging the enforcement of gender stereotypes. Then men started saying they were feminist allies, and women cheered them on, thinking, ""Finally, some of them get it and care about us!"" That led to men calling themselves feminists, and women included them because that's how we're socialized. And now, in traditional male fashion, they have taken over and think they're doing it better."
611,terf_fret,"I know two men like this. 

Edit: Wait, at least four. 

Edit: five."
612,,"You don‚Äôt say! Men? Taking something over and claiming ownership of it? 
Well, I never thought the adult human males would be capable of such things.Its not like feminism was formed because men have been doing that for centuries. 
I am just shocked. Shocked! I tell you h‚Äôwat"

615,2or3thingsIknow,We should be scared. mentally unhinged lunatics who threaten rape and death? Yeah. Stay far away from them.
616,xx_power,"How do you do fellow women? As a womanly woman I routinely wish rape upon other womanly women. Just women things, teehee"
617,AngelaMotorman,Please tell us you reported that to the admins.
618,ThisIsLifeJim,Us feminists are an aggressive bunch......oh wait.....

621,quasarbar,Rape is a hate crime but not legally recognized as a hate crime.
622,LonelyLonerLez,"How awful! This really scares me too... I hope they were banned, but if course they'll be back..."
623,meow_thug,Wow much progress!

625,yaxxy,"The karma for not wanting to get raped is having a family member raped??

Uhuh"
626,dusknoirsbigredeye,Don't all women threaten rape to each other???? /s
627,dusknoirsbigredeye,Stahp my girldick couldn't get more erect!!
628,dusknoirsbigredeye,I honestly didn't even think to. I will go do that now since they left this same comment multiple times to different people.
629,dusknoirsbigredeye,So where is the sub that documents radfems/GC people spewing actual transphobia??? They love to claim that we are actually the aggressors but I've yet to see any proof.
630,dusknoirsbigredeye,Are you talking about me or the guy I screenshotted?
631,,Just gorl  things üò∏
632,,I haven't been! Jeez. Maybe I'm really a man?
633,xx_power,You know it's a real woman talking when they threaten corrective rape with their girl dick
634,Blue_Train,I thought that dude was the admin of the sub.
635,AngelaMotorman,"There's a link at the bottom of every page on Reddit labeled ""contact us"". That will lead to a page where you can submit a link. You don't get much chance to explain anything, but in this case I don't think you need to explain anything."
636,FrettyLounds,"Could you DM me this subreddit? I would love to check out their sad ""proof"""
637,emilialillienne,\**happy rapist noises*\* uwu
638,crispycherrypie,"She means report it to the Reddit admins, not the mods of the sub."
639,dusknoirsbigredeye,I would love to see it also but I don't think it exists. The only kind of proof I have seen them try and use is from alt-right transphobic people. They really love to claim that all violence towards them is from GC/Radfems.
