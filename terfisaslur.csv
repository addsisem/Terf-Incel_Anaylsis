What is a ""TERF""? While ""TERF"" is supposed to stand for ""Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist,"" the people called ""TERF"" generally are neither radical feminists nor ""trans exclusionary,"" and in practice the term has become a slur. [More info.](https://redd.it/70cyzm)

We're documenting hateful rhetoric directed at lesbians, radical feminists, gender critical feminists, and others on Reddit and beyond.

If you're curious about why certain trans activists are clashing with some feminists, see [these resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/wiki/resources#wiki_great_resources_for_people_new_to_gender_critical_feminism) from r/GenderCritical.

2,QueenRowana,WikiMB,That explains how much violent the response for any skepticism regarding transgenderism is. And because of it I either hide or use my alt account to rise my voice on topics like these.
3,scienceisarealthing,Killy00013,Am I misreading this? It sounds like she doesn't belive both sides behave badly calling it a fallacy and also seems to support jk rowling by saying that those who send her death and rape threats arent women

5,LesbianPrincess-,Tulcey-Lee,"I had an account locked yesterday on twitter. Unable to have a discussion with said person as they resorted to calling me a bitch and a terf and then the rape threats started. How is it now we live in a world where you can‚Äôt disagree anymore?

If that means some men get their little girl panties (that they love wearing so much) in a twist. I ain‚Äôt upset. And if they want to use slurs and threaten us while doing it. Well thats hurtful but still inconsequential. Because that report button isn‚Äôt just decorative.  I‚Äôm standing up for women so men, yeah i dont care if you chop off your dick or wear a dress and makeup.  They‚Äôre never gonna be a woman.
Have a lovely day!"
49,,QueenRowana,"I love that this is still pissing men off almost a month later. Men who, by the way, are not and never will be women. Sorry you have no life. Big F (whatever that means)"
50,,QueenRowana,I don‚Äôt think i understand what you mean?
51,,QueenRowana,"Right so how much of that post did you read and how long have the Tims been whispering in your ear?

Women‚Äôs spaces should be for women and women only. These weirdos in wigs and dresses are not and can never be women. No matter how badly they mutilate their genitals. I will not bow down to their behavior and i will not accept insults from ‚Äúallies‚Äù like you.  You contribute to a system that demeans women and denies us our existence. A system that doesn‚Äôt even allow lesbian her sexuality anymore. A system where a male mediocre weightlifter can decide today that he is a woman and start winning gold medals in women‚Äôs classifications tomorrow.

Terf is a foul slur usually accompanied by threats of beatings, rapes and murder to women who refuse to cater to men‚Äôs fragile ego‚Äôs and most notably their autogynephila and fetishes.
I refuse to be called names by woke weirdos like you who think women should die when all we want is to make men get out of our faces, out of our sports and out of out bathrooms. We dont want them to die, we want them to act like a normal human being. Not a anime doll. But you just echo what they teach you.

Next time you call someone trash please re-read this message and realize i could have just insulted you right back. But i didnt do that. Now try and see who is the one between us two capable of calm and rational thought and who has used cursewords as their only retort to a woman standing up for herself."
52,,QueenRowana,"They‚Äôre men. The text says nothing about qualification. I wouldnt want to be treated by an unqualfied woman either. But i dint want to be cared for by a man perion.  These are men, not ‚Äútrans women!?!!‚Äù And yes they are attempting to steal women only spaces. They are men. It‚Äôs their ultimate goal it seems."
53,,QueenRowana,Correct i didn‚Äôt write it. But i had not seen it on this sub before and loved it. I agree with it completely. Men can get the hell out if womens spaces. They are not welcome. And diaper fetishists too by the way sir!
54,,auklet,"Terf is used as a slur, by trans rights activists. You'll often hear it in phrases such as ""kill all terfs.""  I think many ""terfs"" agree that ""terf""  is an accurate term when used to mean ""woman who doesn't agree that a man can become a woman."" But trans activists use it to mean, ""Person who refuses to validate my claim to be a woman and therefore should be humiliated, ostracized, and murdered. """

If you remove delusions of infinite genders, and hedonistic pornographer women being glorified, then I can get behind feminism. I mean, I'm still gonna call obese, dyed haired women ""SJWs""; and I'm sure as hell not denying that men are biologically stronger than women, but other non-sexually-immoral ideologies you guys hold are fine by me."
61,,QueenRowana,"I‚Äôm not against normal men who mind their own business at all. Men can be great. I‚Äôm only against trans people if they are men trying to get away with stuff and get into female spaces by wearing dresses and turning their penis inside out or even just claiming they are women while they arent even remotely trying, they are literally just men. I have little to no trouble with women who try to become men. They don‚Äôt bother me usually. I say good luck to them. They are still weird but I wish them luck fitting in with men. But men trying to be women. Yeah i have something against them and i will fight against them and for women.

Every day.

Again. Have a nice day."
62,,QueenRowana,"I didnt write it. I do agree with it though.

I never said YOU were a man. I just said ‚Äòmen‚Äô but if you felt like i was talking about you go off i guess.

And are you sure you‚Äôre a woman. Isn‚Äôt that enforcing a gender binary which could hurt trans peoples feelings? (Big sarcasm in case you didn‚Äôt get that)"
63,,QueenRowana,"I am indeed not bothered at all by that. Because i care about women and preserving our spaces, not about the fragile ego‚Äôs of men who like to wear dresses and want to be called ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù"
64,,QueenRowana,That dont mean it‚Äôs untrue though. Men with a trans fetish are a danger to women. Whether i wrote it or not doesnt make it false.

Lol. It‚Äôs 50% ‚Äúgrr i‚Äôm not allowed in womens [fill in here: bathroom, locker room, rape shelter, prison] Let‚Äôs put on a dress and waltz in, no one will dare stop me‚Äù. These are predators out to get weak women and many cases are documented of  so called ‚Äútrans women‚Äù (men) getting permission to go to female prision instead of male and at the very least creeping the fuck out of vulnerable women and at worst rape and hurt them. Many cases about men freaking out for not being admitted to women rape shelters. Cases of men sendingvdeath threats to lesbians who refuse to fuck men with dicks. Of pedophiles who claim to be trans to get lowered sentences. Of men going Into womens bathrooms with ugly dresses and terrible fake wigs just for fun and to terrify women in a space where once they would have come to get away from men.

And 50% ‚Äú i just want to have tits to play with and be submissive slut in bed‚Äù. Of which the last one i will admit are usually not quite as nefarious. But they‚Äôre definitely AGP."
71,,QueenRowana,"Fetish? Lol i have literally 0 fetishes.  Your ‚Äútendencies‚Äù are a fetish.
I care about women enough to not want men with dicks forcing themselves into lesbian spaces, into women rape shelters, into womens locker rooms, toilets and prisons.  If your main objective is forcing women to just lie down and take it while men like you walk all over them you are not a feminist."

73,,QueenRowana,"Fascination with ‚Äúlady dick‚Äù? I have never used that word except to express my disgust at the word. Maybe you mistook my disgusted frustration at men referring to penises as a ‚Äúgirldick‚Äù for fascination, HalfBreed?

78,,pennysapphic,"Oh I'm so sorry to hear about your experience and ptsd... but you'll still find a way to swallow it down for the comfort of men, right?

Oh I'm so sorry that you were raped, but you still understand that *not all men* do that, right? You musnt forget to say that before and after you apologetically share what happened to you.

Oh I'm sorry the rape crisis center was defunded by a man, but I hope you understand it's because those women were bigots for wanting to heal privately and with dignity. Their wants outweigh your needs, because as a woman, you are everything they wish they were. This is ""privledge"", not objectification.

Oh I'm so so sorry to hear you didnt place in your sport after training your whole life because men now compete in womens sports. But the fact they get the limited scholarships and opportunities for women, should really be an inspiration for you to just work harder and be quietly supportive.

Oh I'm so so VERY sorry that abortions are punishable by a life sentence in certain states and getting harder and harder to access, but it seems so exclusionary since transwomen dont get to experience this, so we shouldn't focus on it. The most important thing is that everything is about transwomen all the time. If it's not, then it's about how it hurts them that it's not, and THAT is the important peice of every puzzle.

Oh, you dont like the red robes they are rolling out...I'm so so so sorry about that. But it's because you are lucky enough to be born a woman. I wish I was a woman, red is definitely my color and the cap hides my male pattern baldness UwU"

177,,Throwaway4638574,I almost downvoted this out of disgust
178,,Tangleofsnakes,I'm glad it's illegal to send unsolicited dick pics in Texas.
179,,rockandroll666,"Are these underage girls? Because this person would then be sending porn to minors...
even if adults this is still is illegal right? It‚Äôs sexual harassment?
If this happened to me I would contact the authorities. If this person is willing to go this extreme over this minor bs then they‚Äôre probably willing to do even worse stuff in real life to women and girls and should be scared of the consequences"

190,,Randomosaur,Do they not see how creepy and sexually harassing this is? I have lost all hope for libfems being self aware at this point.

195,,tireddandelion,"it is? damn texas, you did something right"
196,,fiftyspiders,"i think this was posted to r/itsafetish as well and yes there were minors in the facebook group and they were taught how to report to the police but by then the offender had deleted their account so who knows where they went to terrorize next

204,,noralily23,doomed? nah we go back into stealth mode until it normalizes again. and by that i mean talk to every female you know in real life about this. I have not encountered 1 female friend that has been pro trans; we're all confused by it. Don't text or IM or rely on public social media to discuss this. This conversation is best had in person.
205,,tireddandelion,"Lol just don‚Äôt open DMs. Mention in your accounts (bios, posts, whatever) that you don‚Äôt read DMs. They have no power"
206,,lwoass,why not both?

208,,goneharolding,"This is great advice anyway. It can actually be scarier to talk about in person but you are so right, it‚Äôs vital."

211,,user875098,"This is one of the most disgusting things I‚Äôve ever seen. Threatening and harassing women who have already been traumatized because they don‚Äôt want another male predator in their fucking rape shelter. Oger is a first class narcissistic, misogynistic creep who should be shamed instead of applauded."
212,,tireddandelion,Note: The Rape Relief Women‚Äôs Shelter was defunded because of these men.
213,,girl_undone,A few months old but I wanted to sticky something about this.
214,,GeorgiaMRomero,"No outrage from the woke, I presume."
215,,aquametalmermaid,"deplorable. :( one of my old lib fem friends who devotes her life to being a TRA used to live in Vancouver and vacations there regularly. sounds like a beautiful city, so what an absolute shame to see lib fems terrorize the place. I hope all the women using this shelter and/or their services are kept safe."
216,,Randomosaur,This makes me wish for a mass extinction.
217,,ciaokhan,"Creeping through their subs, they still believe it's their god given right to be in shelters and centers.

How fucking barbaric and narcissistic must you be to demand services that push out the original sex it was meant for."
218,,meow_thug,I was so brainwashed by TRAs up until a few months ago that this wasn't even my peak moment. Truly unbelievable. And lib fems don't have a fucking thing to say when I use this example of why exclusivity is paramount for women's spaces.
219,,bishhpls,"If something sums up these people's utter hatred and contempt for women, this is it. The fact they are demanding women who have been traumatised by men and their male bodies allow them into the one space that is meant to be totally free of those traumatic elements, simply to validate their 'true and honest womanhood' is nothing short of horrifying. If a literal rape crisis centre isn't safe, where is?

They want to allow men who have a sexual fetish regarding objectifying women into a slew of outdated sexist stereotypes into a place where women are healing from sexual trauma. Where they will most likely exude exhibitionism and sexually harass these vulnerable women. All for sexual gratification and their own validation. TIMs claim to need these centres, and some may, but I believe the number of them that truly need shelter may be quite low and the rest are just creepy boundary pushing AGPs. Yet when they are offered separate accommodations away from the women, that just isn't good enough, they must be treated as exactly the same as a biological woman, even though they are NOT the same and belong to the group who victimised the women in the first place. That tells you all you need to know. They do not care about the actual shelter, they just care they're not included and not being constantly validated. So selfish."
220,,pixipod,quintessentially trans.
221,,zhvair,"Yikes. Now that I know the anti-terf rhetoric is starting to bleed into animal abuse, I now have good proof of how scary and insane this is starting to get."

226,,MaxinistaFemmeinista,"This is woke violence, you know, specifically directed at lesbians, women that have been abused, or women who dissent. Hmmm woke people sure hate one sex specifically."
227,,terf_fret,The people leading the terrorizing directly are male. Libfems bringing up the rear.
228,,finallyaboy,"Honestly, I live in Vancouver. Such a huge population of trans people, especially like this."

235,,girl_undone,"Maybe the trans community should do something about this culture they created that encourages mentally ill trans people to attack ""TERFs""."
236,,noT99009,"Imagine having a penis and thinking you‚Äôre a girl, has to be a mental illness right? imagine having a vagina and thinking you‚Äôre a boy. Mental illness innit? it‚Äôs like the color blue believing it‚Äôs the color yellow. no matter how many times it screams that it is yellow, it will always be blue. That‚Äôs why it feels required to run aroun and scream that it is yellow, to convince itself and others."
