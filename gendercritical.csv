@jk\_rowling Thank you for saying this. WE LOVE YOU ‚ö°Ô∏è [twitter](https://twitter.com/rGenderCritical/status/1208084151573725184)"
1,RetlaOge,"Christ... the kind of shit people are replying you'd think she'd murdered an entire nursery of disabled kids or something.

It's twitter though, so no real surprise it's full of absolute clowns.

Apparently it's now *""cruel and primitive""* to understand that sex exists... Who the fuck are these people? How do they manage to function in the real world?"
2,MrMojoRiseman,"The replies to the tweet are just incredible. All she said was don't fire a woman for saying biological sex is a thing, and people are saying that trans kids wouldn't be allowed in Hogwarts and that Rowling is a literal Death Eater üòÇ"
3,GoshawkToday,"The fact that she put the hashtag #ThisIsNotADrill indicates she knows perfectly well what she is doing. ""This is Not a Drill"" is the title of an article, mentioned in another post in this sub, written by Kathleen Stock and subtitled ""I call upon UK academic philosophers and other academics to publicly demonstrate their disciplinary values."" Kathleen Stock is mentioned in Julie Bindel's recent article, ""Triumph of the Trans Lobbyists.""

I wonder if anyone else if putting up any #ThisIsNotADrill tweets."
4,ComplicatedSpirit,"Digg.com's article on the issue said that J.K. Rowling is wrong because ""trans people have a right to exist"". Jesus fuck. Any time some random person doesn't give them what they want, it gets blown into some massive human tragedy on par with the worst violations of the right to live. 

NO ONE SAID TIP DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO EXIST. Fuck. Not buying into your ideology =/= believing you don't have the right to exist. 

It's like having someone refuse to convert to your religion and claiming that they want you dead because of it."
5,remquarqk,"I still can't believe a CHARITY WORKER was fired. 

People in the biological, medical sciences say things like ""sex is immutable"" every single day. 

If I wasn't on this sub I don't think I would understand the level of pushback a statement like this would cause."
6,Taveing,"This is fantastic! This must be difficult for her as she'll undoubtedly attract a lot of venom from some of her own supporters. Like Dumbledore says: ""It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.‚Äù"
7,littlecandyapple,"As much as I love this, the replies are so bizarre. Guilt-tripping someone for acknowledging reality. I hope she doesn‚Äôt cave in and apologize to the TRA circlejerk."
8,quasarbar,"SEX IS REAL.

What the actual fuck is going on when you're ""violating human rights"" by stating an objective scientific fact?"
9,Beepus_Maleepus,"Ok today is the day. I've fucking peaked. Reading through the comments to her tweet has well and truly stuck the knife in. All my life I have suffered because I am female. I don't ""feel"" any way in particular, I *am* female. And I have suffered for it. From being raped at 7 to being abused by my ex boyfriend and everything in between. Now we are being told these experiences are imaginary and to suggest that our experiences are because of our BIOLOGICAL SEX is fucking transphobic!  I just can't anymore. This is insane, I am done."
10,freshpicked12,Now THAT is a brave and stunning woman.
11,UnableGiraffe3,"I'm not surprised! She might be filthy rich now but once upon a time she was the kind of woman who spent time in women's shelters. I speak from experience when I say middle class privilege makes it easy to chant transwomen are women because it doesn't even occur to ask questions like ""what if I was at a homeless shelter and my roommate was the Gamestop Ma'am? What if I were in prison and had to share a shower with Kate White?"""
12,femaleisnotafeeling,"People are losing their damn minds in the replies. They love posting that photo of Emma Watson wearing the ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äùshirt, as if JKR is advocating for the hunt of trans people for sport."
13,vageennpeenrgender,"I‚Äôm shook right now. I feel like I will never have the professional and personal security to be so bold.
Seeing JK be brave enough to STAND UP is amazing to me. HP was a big part of my childhood and family life."
14,ThrowThrowBurritoABC,A few months ago several of my acquaintances went to local libraries and hid Rowling's books so patrons couldn't find them.   At least two refused to let their children read Harry Potter because they consider her a TERF.
15,Calamity_loves_tacos,"So surprising (/s) how such a sound, non aggressive statement is met with loads of memes saying ""shut the fuck up terf"" with cutesy guns being pointed from the side shouting about being on ""the right side of history""."
16,restlessyears,"Oh thank goodness. Well done JK. We need someone with her profile to stand up for women.

The replies and indirects about her tweet is absolutely INSANE.... all this whining and crying about ‚Äúhow will the trans kids feel seeing this‚Äù and all this... what?? Nobody should be so fragile and deluded that they cry at the MATERIAL REALITY that biological sex is a real thing. Like other commenters have said, people are making it seem as if she is some sort of mass murderer for acknowledging a basic fact that EVERYONE ACCEPTED up until recently."
17,flapyourwings,"Oh damn, JK went IN!"
18,sara7147,YES!!!  So glad a celebrity had the balls to stand up and SAY SOMETHING!!!
19,cavesofsponge,"Thank you, J.K."
20,modernmedusaa,"FANTASTIC NEWS!!

And this is why I love when poor women end up super rich but don't forget about their sisters- she is still in touch with her struggles as a single mother and the other underdogs thrown under the bus

Also writing fantasy novels for a living she probs has a lot to say about that LOLLLL

Glad JK was able to see the growing gravitas of this issue. This is actually huge given her level of fame!! Seems like she was flirting with it in the background but has now decided to go full throttle GC!!!"
21,raddy-set-go,"I find it deeply disturbing that merely saying ""sex  is real"" is now front page news. I genuinely feel like I'm going crazy reading the responding tweets, like I've stepped into a parallel universe."
22,accioupvotes,Oof. According to some of the comments this post is rising in /r/all. Prepare for the TRAs
23,Saitschik,The comments under her tweet are a living proof that many transgenderpeople unfortunately have severe mental health issue. The way they are losing it is more than creepy and the way they threaten women for their agenda disgusting. Everybody supporting them supports a new form of misogyny. Plain and simple.
24,sojourner_truth_,Yes!!!! I love to hear celebrities pushing back.
25,2or3thingsIknow,The idiot trans loons who trashed her from a Like on a tweet caused their own issues. The more they screech and whine and ban and censor the more people push back. Of course she was going to be a terf. This is what happens when you are metaphorically and literally bullied by men. You push back.
26,FlyinBananaPhone,The man who started all this with Maya referred to a feminist charity group as ‚Äúroasties‚Äù and said he hoped they got raped. Incel language.
27,BasieSkanks,"Rowling didn‚Äôt even mention gender ideology, and the TRAs are losing their shit.  She only mentioned that biological sex is real. How can ANYONE with a functioning brain stem argue with that? The fact they are frothing at the mouth at a statement of objective true just shows how crazy this movement has become."
28,mokebe_asfalit,Is woke twitter going to start comparing her to Voldemort now?
29,Jo_in_TN,"This court ruling has emboldened cyclopath.  He is talking lawsuits and is wanting to contact major news publications.   

He really thinks he can sue every woman into shutting up, but will more likely begin a campaign of contacting employers of every woman who speaks out.   I have nothing to lose to this bully, but I fear for women in the U.K.

I can read his twitter account from my phone only (which I find difficult), since I'm been blocked on my computer.  :)"
30,antediluvian5,"Came to this sub to see if anyone was talking about this! I saw ‚ÄúJK Rowling is a terf‚Äù trending and thought, ‚ÄúGood for her. I like her more now.‚Äù"
31,RealMapelFlavour,"""Cool."" - Magdalen Berns"
32,furious_doog,Watch them burn their Harry Potter books.
33,moglbu,The replies to her tweet are all people claiming to be in tears and heartbroken. I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine being that affected by someone‚Äôs words.
34,shapesofthesea,"I read the tweet and my first thought was, she‚Äôs not saying anything wrong. She‚Äôs acknowledging reality. The people angry about her comment are so deep in denial. I don‚Äôt get it."
35,,[deleted]
36,Jenjenhar,"So wonderful that JK is brave enough to stand up for common sense and women‚Äôs rights. A large number of her fans are crying about it. Looks like they still believe in fantasies.

Maya F is crowdfunding her legal fees. Unfortunately she has only hit ¬£85,000 so far. It‚Äôs against rules to link it but please please donate if you are able to."
37,apfrun,"I cannot believe saying ""sex is real"" is such a massive issue. Also how is it even transphobic whatsoever? Even trans people fucking know they have a biological sex. This is all so ridiculous lol."
38,,[deleted]
39,BanksyGuy00018,"Just some minutes later you'll see hundreds of raging lib HP fans dissowning JK and talking trash about their fav franchise.
Maybe now they'll read another book"
40,Ergative_Absolutive,Goddess bless her.
41,yesisaiditxx,"I‚Äôm so amazed. I wish she‚Äôd know that despite all of the people who throw this to the erroneous extreme of, ‚ÄúShe hates trans people‚Äù and attack her accordingly, there are women out there like me who read that from such a distinguished person and felt that they could breathe a little more easily. I had really believed that no person of her caliber would ever do this‚Äî hell, I had even doubted that any were out there who didn‚Äôt buy in to the fantasy. Anyone who accuses her of hateful bigotry is living in their fragile imagination. She‚Äôs not calling for trans abuse in any way. She is simply speaking up for what she knows as true regarding justice and reality. 

People often tell the story of how she started Harry Potter, and I see that same determined woman in this tweet. Congratulations to J.K Rowling for living with integrity."
42,gencritgenz,the like ratio is also really encouraging! way more likes than any of her recent tweets!!
43,,Women continue to suffer while men don't. This is not fair and it is not right.
44,knight_siegmeyer,"BEAUTIFUL. Thank you JK! I've always felt a little honoured to have a signed copy of The Goblet of Fire from her but now it's extra special ngl. 

I take back everything I said about the Crimes of Grindlewald being kinda bad. (But not the Cursed Child. I stand by my review of 'pretty show, not nearly as good as the actual books')"
45,EquivalentApple,"Holy shit I hope JK Tweets about the Scottish GRA reform consultation. The fucking bastards have been trying to sneak it in below the radar like they always do. Coincidentally Wings over Scotland, the biggest Scottish GC Twitter account and the one with the widest reach, got banned the day they announced the consultation."
46,Tonglentoo,Just got called a terf today over in Twitter for applauding her. üòè
47,stompbixby,"maybe shes sick of literal hundreds of creeps arguing about 'girldick' in every fucking tweet she makes

it would bother me less if there werent actual tweets from children sandwiched between these fucking girldick tweets

god bless you jkr"
48,,"The only negative consequence of this are the liberal think pieces that are going to flood youtube on why JK Rowling is cancelled and how ‚Äúwrong‚Äù she is. üòÇ

_All_ the people I follow who usually stick to pop culture and avoid politics, are going to have something to say about this. I‚Äôm tired already."
49,spoopypigeon,finally
50,Felix_Dzerjinsky,Holy shit TRA heads will explode.
51,Fitncurly,I think I‚Äôll go out and buy the entire Harry Potter set just for this üòÜ.  Yessss!
52,black_it_out,Hurrah!! I was so miserable this morning - the court ruling was outrageous. I now feel galvanised. Speaking out always makes a difference.
53,sparklesailor,"She‚Äôs in a unique position in that she‚Äôs made her fortune and success and is no longer reliant on public opinion. We all know she‚Äôs had these opinions for a while but I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs finally being open and bold about it. The TRAs can cry and complain if they want, and call for a boycott of one of the world‚Äôs biggest and most beloved franchises, and it won‚Äôt make the slightest bit of difference."
54,vitisrotundifolia,"If you listen closely, you can hear thousands peaking at once"
55,Deleteordecay,"Really appreciate when influential people, especially women stand up to this bullshit. Maybe she can have a word with Emma Watson.

The replies are both sad and comical at the same time.

Edit: remember the outrage over a tweet she liked? She knew she was gonna catch hate for this but did it anyway. Good for her."
56,,[deleted]
57,maiarooberts,"Shout out to JK Rowling for taking a stand because this shit has been getting ridiculous. They're engaged and it's currently trending on Twitter. They even have ""JK Rowling is a TERF"" trending. LOL"
58,Sasasamker,"Such a big deal. I have been trying to battle commenters on that post by explaining what the T-word means, who uses it, why the case was important, why it was so disappointing, why it's outrageous she lost her job, how sex cant change. 

The basics really. Same as in real life, gently gently explaining to people why this is harmful to women. 

If you arent already, would any of you mind joining in on Twitter and helping us look as reasonable as we are? The TRA's are out in force. Unfortunately for them, they've come out with the gun memes and manga characters and look, frankly, ridiculous."
59,purrfekt,T\*RF is trending now on Twitter üôÑ
60,whitelilyflower,"Good for her. The replies to her tweet are so pathetic, I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre at a point in time where stating basic facts about biology can get you crucified. Ridiculous."
61,Lonely_Cartographer,She said how I feel exactly! I don't care if men want to dress like women or even call them women as long as they are not legally recognized as women and i don't get thrown in jail for calling them a man
62,Aunpasoportucasa,Why is it wrong to understand there is a biological sex? People are completely overreacting. I see a lot of Harry Potter tattoo coverups in the near future.
63,quack-snack,The number of people apparently reduced to a puddle of tears over this - a statement of biological fact and reality - makes me laugh.
64,ShootTheMoon03,"Apparently Mark Hamill liked the tweet. I suspect a lot more prominent figures share the same views but don‚Äôt want to deal with the Twitter circus and ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù. Twitter really thinks they are the majority opinion because they start trending topics and try to cancel everyone when it‚Äôs really propelled by teenagers and college age kids trying to be woke and regurgitating they same mantras, such as‚Äùtranswomen are women‚Äù, without a clue of what they‚Äôre talking about . They can‚Äôt even define woman without circular logic or sexist stereotypes"
65,Far-Air,She is wonderful and knows actual kindness‚Äî not TRA-‚Äòkindness‚Äô threatened into her. We need more people like her standing up for women.
66,ATWTFRK,This is almost too good to be true!
67,Sasofa,"They're gonna try and cancel her in every way possible.

Too bad cancel culture doesn't exist. I can think of very few people who have been ""cancelled"" on Twitter and had anly longterm negative impact on their career. All she has to do is not address it."
68,FrenchieFrankenstein,I‚Äôm so glad
69,lefromageetlesvers,"Never read the Harry Potter books, because i was too old when they came out, but i'm all in. I'm teaching philosophy, so maybe i can work her into on my syllabus. Great news!"
70,purrfekt,"Well! Excuse me, while I cheer (silently at work)! üòç 

I'll remember this, when the famous skeptic dudebros come along and appropriate the resistance against TRA. The cowards."
71,SadMadNomad,"Good for her. I know she's super rich and all, but it takes guts nowadays to speak common sense. She didn't say anything particularly controversial, yet we all know how simply acknowledging biological sex as a reality is considered ""transphobic.""

I enjoyed the Harry Potter books when I was a kid, but I never stuck around too long in the fandom. Every big fandom has its overzealous fans; the petty side of me wonders how libfem HP fans will handle this. Judging by the responses on Twitter, I'm sure they'll be oh so calm and open-minded, unlike evil transphobic JK Rowling...

Seriously though, I can't believe we live in a world where ""sex is real"" needs to be said and is considered offensive. I'm glad someone greatly influential like JK Rowling is speaking out.

Edit: I looked up more responses on Twitter and Tumblr, and I can't feel a smidgen of gleeful pettiness like I thought I could. The viciousness and heartbreak many people are showing is exhausting. Rowling said nothing hateful or prejudiced, yet people are treating her as if she's a supervillain on the levels of Voldemort."
72,spin_the_globe,"Good for her. Never been a Harry Potter fan, but that may have to change."
73,tr330fsn4rk,"Some idols never let you down.. 

This is absolutely wonderful! And she was so classy about it, too."
74,rezkidsinlove,"Where's that David Tennant 10th Doctor 'GOOD OL' J.K.!!!!!!' gif????

(Also, presumably, The Tenth Doctor knew about all this, considering he's a Time Lord and all. The Doctor is a TERF, confirmed.)

I think I might wear my Gryffindor scarf today in solidarity."
75,jadedjude,"I hope she stands her fucking ground.

One look at the replies and I wanna gag, I hate these people so fucking much. I'm not a rad fem so I find it ironic they call anyone a terf simply because we hate their bullshit.

I doubt JK is even a TERF, she's just peak trans and I'm glad she had the balls to speak her mind.

\#IStandwithJKR"
76,Lesbian_Frylock,Finally. Saw this coming from all of her rabid genderkweer fans annoying her constantly. She was gonna crack eventually.
77,why_cambrio,"Pleasantly surprised at the amount of support in the comments, even if it is intermittently placed in between memes that are LITERALLY calls to violence against ""t\*rfs"""
78,raddy-set-go,"I've liked her tweet. That doesn't seem at all like a big deal but I'm becoming less afraid. Especially considering women (and some men like @glinner but let's face it mostly women) are actually paying with their livelihoods for stating the truth. It's the least I can do.

Edit: a number of people I know and follow have called J.K. Rowling an ""evil terf"" or something to that effect, saying they stand by ""those she has hurt with her transphobia""... And these are otherwise intelligent seeming people. I've not uttered a word of my own on the matter but I can't help feeling like I need to brace myself for some backlash soon."
79,medusahisshiss,"I picture her reading the responses, laughing, surrounded by piles of money. I love it."
80,trw365,"I feel so sorry for Maya that she is having to go through all of this, from her writing she seems to have a very clever and smart point of view about international tax policy, its a pity she isn't still in the job she loved but at the same time I am enjoying the sun shining through the overton window now that people are now discussing how batshit this all is."
81,Shotgunshine__,"I‚Äôve been a Harry Potter fan since I was 8, and I thought that I couldn‚Äôt love her more. She has officially proven me wrong! I‚Äôm so glad that she‚Äôs using her massive platform to say what the rest of us are thinking."
82,LeishaCamden,I was SO HAPPY when I saw this on Twitter earlier today. This is a big deal.
83,DownWithPorn,Well done Rowling! Looks like my country is leading the way in resisting this trans bullshit.
84,antikvariaatti,I'm proud of her.
85,brownclown96,Yes!!! Queen Rowling. It is so valuable to have people in her position who cannot be silenced by firing or intimidation to speak out on behalf of women. I‚Äôm so happy she‚Äôs done this
86,hobbittoisengard,Things like these shows the true qualities of the trans movement. Ignorance and rudeness.
87,vierkeervijf,Well done Joanne! The TRAs are going crazy and showing their true nature to an even wider audience now!
88,arnaq,Fuck yes! Ily JK Rowling! Come visit us at this sub :)
89,NoctaeBride,What a fucking queen. Unironically.
90,InASeaOfReality,My favorite part is the trans activists comparing her to characters from her own book
91,PollyannaPenny,"I'm so glad she finally came out of the Gender Critical closet officially. We need women like Rowling in our corner because not only is she a beloved figure, she's so rich that she doesn't have to worry about her income being slashed or becoming financially destitute as a result of being ""cancelled"". So she can say things that many other women WANT to say but can't because they can't afford to lose their careers and reputations.

&#x200B;

TRAs can call her ""Hitler"" and ""TERF"" all they like. She'll still be collecting those sweet Harry Potter royalty checks!"
92,astheykissconsume,"""Joanne Andrea,""¬†I said quietly, ""you were named for two censored feminists. One of them was called a TERF and she was probably¬†the bravest woman I ever knew."""
93,writerlylesbian,"Hilariously, I remember back in the early 2000s when it was the religious right who were banning Harry Potter books for being full of the devil's work. Now the Left have met them on the other side of the horseshoe and are banning the books too!"
94,mossmalachite,"In a FB group that‚Äôs something like, ‚Äúliking harry potter isn‚Äôt a personality trait‚Äù where people post like over the top HP themed weddings and people naming their kids Albus, and they‚Äôre absolutely going off about how transphobic it is and all the ‚ÄúAS A WOMAN WITH A PENIS I AM SO SAD TO KNOW I WOULDNT BE ALLOWED AT HOGWARTS‚Äù and I had to come here and read logical reactions to regain my sanity"
95,glitteristheanswer,"Original tweet was awesome and she clearly knows what shes doing! If I didnt work in games and animation I'd retweet with a million confetti horn emojis! Really depressing to see my entire timeline filled with people I look up to in my field or consider intelligent equals saying ""if you're a terf you can go die"" and just repeating ""trans rights are human rights"" 

No they're fucking not frankly, they're exceptional not standard. Human rights (for women,for minority groups, for disabled people) are rights and protections you CANT CHANGE. If you change your mind on your gender WELL LOOK AT THAT YOU CHANGED AND IT MEANS ITS SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY THAT ISNT IMMUTABLE. That makes any request for those rights or protections exceptional, a luxury,NOT a requirement"
96,tgrewy,"A beautiful peak trans end to a decade of madness.   
Hi r/all please read links in the sidebar and also visit r/itsafetish or r/actuallynotlesbians for more great content."
97,LucyWColitisGoesBy,"> Trans folks have an extraordinary high suicide rate... can we just let them have the identity they want please? They're not doing anyone any harm. Leave them alone. 

Some of these people are so full of shit it's coming out of their ears. The fact that mentally ill men kill themselves is not our problem. Why the fucking hell should all the women of the world have to agree that a woman is a identity for a mentally ill man to have? 

As for not doing any harm that's a laugh. This woman is being fired for stating they're not women. Rowling is being called horrible names for standing at her side. How about they leave us alone?"
98,milpathecat,I am so happy and just came here to say I love all women of Gender Critical and especially the mods and veterans for doing the hard work for years!!!! You absolute stars!
99,UterusUnderground,"Honestly, seeing what feels like the entire female nerd establishment coming for Rowling‚Äôs neck makes me feel so hopeless. It‚Äôs so hard to be reminded that women that I once felt so much kinship with are caught up in this misogynist ideology almost to a fault. I saw Siobhan Thomas tweet that Rowling was a bitch who should retire, and it just broke my heart. Mara Wilson, Noelle Stevenson, Kate Beaton... I know that these women are libfems, they have to be to get anywhere in the nerd establishment, but it‚Äôs still disheartening to be reminded of how intolerant and extremist the whole scene has become. Or maybe it always was? I think I finally understand what the gamergaters meant when they said they wanted politics out of nerd media (even if I otherwise think they were a bunch of fools).  

I am so glad Christmas is happening and I at least won‚Äôt be seeing my irl nerd friends until this has hopefully calmed down a bit, because I‚Äôm sure they would talk about it and I just can‚Äôt deal with that. I just want to agree to disagree and move on to talking about Godzilla."
100,OCPEoireitum,"I was raised to think that accusations of thoughtcrime, crimethink, and wrongthink were worse than the blasphemy they sought to punish. FYI I am a man (adult human male) - and suspect that we both read, interpret and take lessons from Orwell in exactly the same way. 

That was a very scary judgment.....and the decision, to use a legal term - seems ‚Äòperverse‚Äô indeed."
101,slushpilot,"From the BBC article:

>""It is a core component of her belief that she will refer to a person  by the sex she considered appropriate even if it violates their dignity  and/or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or  offensive environment,"" he continued.  
>  
>""The approach is not worthy of respect in a democratic society.""

So, calling things as you see them is not allowed in a democratic society? Have we no freedom to think as individuals anymore? What makes such a society *democratic,* then?"
102,BoringDisorder,"People are acting like she said transpeople don't deserve rights or respect. She literally just said that a woman should not lose her job for acknowledging biological sex. You can't change it. Maybe one day that technology will exist, but it doesn't currently. That's like someone saying ""believe what you want, but don't fire someone for saying the earth isn't flat"" and it causing huge outrage. Hard sciences exist and we shouldn't cover our ears and act like theory is more viable. 

She probably knew there'd be a lot of backlash and posted the tweet anyways. Proud of her."
103,Amareldys,Someone rich and famous finally stood up for women! JK Rowling if you read this board... I LOVE YOU!
104,Amphibiava,"I loved *Harry Potter* so much as a kid and adolescent (and I still have a lot of nostalgia for it now), and JK hasn't let me down üòä"
105,_ad-meliora_,I'm so proud of her
106,carpetplaydohx2,GOOD FOR HER!!!!!!!!!!
107,Nickels4Tickles,The Twitter mob tantrums are so damn funny. Can't wait to piss off the woke crowd just by being a HP character for Halloween next year.
108,pixipod,"The amount of people losing their shit over someone saying bio sex is real is.....wow. I honestly can't believe this is reality. 

Also reading everything going down on twitter, the cult like aspects of transgender ideology are really apparent."

112,anchovycupcakes,"I read some tweets, and one of them is like, I grew up reading your books and loved Harry Potter. What have I done to you? Why do you hate me and people like me?

Who the fuck said she hates you? You're just not a woman. FFS.

I knew what it would be like, but the pile on she's experiencing now is just incredible.

Thankfully, she has lots of money and I don't think she gives a fuck."

114,TheOGJammies,"I really fucking love this woman more and more everyday. Let me get my coins together and go buy the Harry Potter box set for people for Christmas, brb."

121,exkinksterthrowaway,"Yaaaaaasssss!  She's one of us!

  
That said, I figured JK was GC, but the Maya Forstater situation must have peaked her enough to actually come out with it."
122,chinpropped,"I get more and more radical feminist as a pushback to all this shit. I have no problem at all with transgender and fully support them IN THEIR OWN SPACES.
But we women are constantly being asked to make room for those who did not grow up female and who make everything into uterus-havers and pregnant people.
They deserve to have their own space. Women deserve our own space, free of being shut up and shut out by biological men."

125,SometimesJacka,"One thing that‚Äôs fascinating is watching people not involved in these ideologies tip-toe around the drama. 

So many people being like ‚Äú*obviously* this isn‚Äôt about saying you can change your sex. *Obviously* you can‚Äôt *actually* change your sex. This is about gender and *identity*.‚Äú

126,ZombieSazza,"In Scotland the number 3 trending hashtag is ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äù, number 5 being ‚ÄúI Stand With Maya Forstater‚Äù.

So twitter is at war of trans folk losing their shit and shouting ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äù, gender critical folk pointing out ‚Äúbut women‚Äôs rights aren‚Äôt trans rights‚Äù, lots of threats towards Rowling, lots of folk speaking out in favour of Rowling including gender critical Scottish MP Joan McAlpine and Blair White, and several trans folk supporting Rowling as well (sadly being drowned out), basically a bit of a war zone.

Vast majority of Scottish folk I‚Äôve seen online support what Rowling has said.

Maya Lost her job for being gender critical, and folk are trying to claim she was horrible etc, but she was calm, makes sense, is defending women‚Äôs rights, and trans folk are screaming over the top of everyone, including Amnesty International,

>Why should she even apologize? What she said was 100% fact. Lopping off your manhood or attaching one to yourself doesn't magically change your DNA. You still have the same XX or XY chromosomes and are still biologically whatever gender you were born as.

284,womenopausal,"Oddly enough, that particular episode was written by the Who writer who got his chapter canned from a book, because another writer in the collection said he was transphobic.

Everywhere where biological sex was considered the defining factor is now being harnessed to gender."
302,Ergative_Absolutive,"In the UK, a woman who tweeted that biological sex could not be changed was fired by her employer. (Note that she wasn't accused of not using trans people's prefered names or pronouns, and in fact explicitly said that she would do so out of courtesy; it was simply her stated position that men are male, women are female, and the pretense that one can become the other is nothing more than a legal fiction.) Yesterday, a UK court upheld this woman's firing, claiming that her statement that people could not change sex was incoherent and incompatible with a democratic society. JKR is coming out in support of the fired woman, and by extension the many UK feminists who question the wisdom of overwriting sex with gender identity in UK law."

Somehow the solution there isn't to get them proper help, oh no, it's to totally abandon all logic in favour of pandering to their delusion.

I‚Äôm Jewish, and upon first reading the books as a kid thought it was funny how many Jewish stereotypes the goblins embodied; greed, small-stature, cleverness, long noses,financial wiles, insularity, etc. Tho I don‚Äôt think JKR is anti-Semitic by any means, I do think she very likely drew on a certain trope without consciously recognizing that such a trope was historically assigned to Jews...and she probably should have been a bit more careful not to do that lol

321,Far-Air,"While I agree, I don't see the point of the discussion going there since JK Rowling didn't do anything actually wrong. She doesn't think sex can actually be changed-- aka, she subscribes to reality."

I grew up reading the Alex Rider and Diamond Brother Series by Anthony Horowitz. They‚Äôre still my favourite teen books today, even though Horowitz has made some questionable remarks about having a black James Bond

The woke activists try to push for cancelling EVERYTHING a person has ever done if they say anything even vaguely ""problematic"". And they seem to think that, if you can look past the author's questionable statements and just enjoy their art, you are somehow agreeing with and/or validating everything they have ever said or done."

&#x200B;

For real, these narcissists don't even realize that REAL women can't even get away with that crap. We'd be laughed at as well if we wore drag queen makeup and fishnets to the grocery store. We just don't make a fuss about it because we don't see validation as a human right."
419,modernmedusaa,"Anyone who makes you nervous about speaking the truth should be instantly labelled as suspicious..

Am I the only one who is disappointed by the sheer number of women in 2019 who have allowed themselves to be silenced on this issue? This is collective brainwashing...it might seem like nothing...just a silent nervous woman worried about her job here, another few 10000 there and then suddenly you have the collective collapse of womens rights worldwide!!! This is how it happens!

I will lose a job in a hot minute for something like this but then again I had a tough upbringing & am really not with the bullshit. Also my value lies outside of capitalism and its demands so I really do not give a shit about some poncey woke male telling me to swing my hook bc I made a man in fishnets uncomfortable. I just think about the Nazi's to remind myself of the importance of speaking up for morality against the madness of crowds. So often people make out like they are trapped in their job- no you have trapped yourself in that job...the world is very big and there's plenty of employers who won't force you to believe biological sex is a lie. Way more than you think in fact...or worse comes to worse work at home/online for an agency. Work for yourself and cut out the woke middle man. Connect with your sisters, I'm sure at least one knows a position going or a lawyer of some kind. Don't allow them to make you feel fearful and trapped

Damn...it was only 30 years ago marital rape was legal...wake up women! We aren't as safe as you think! Our rights need constant defence in the numbers! Think of the bigger picture!

I hear a lot of women talking a big feminist empowerment game nowadays but when it comes to supporting their sisters in difficult situations and saying SEX IS REAL they are somehow easily swayed into silence or the 'ummm ermmm I don't know'?

GET A GRIP WOMEN!!!! We need you to be stronger if we are to ever gain a real footing on this planet!!!"

He then dressed up in her clothes and was presumably going to live in her home and ""take over her life"" according to his manifesto.

Doesn't that just make ya feel the \~sisterhood\~ with TIMs?

They definitely are infatuated with womanhood to the point of violence, probably even more often than the average man, which is really saying something.

So basically, you might be able to argue these tropes are rooted from a anti-semitic/racist/sexist place, but modern writers aren't consciously using them for those specific implications.

Now the menz are jealous of this and they want in, but only once they've lived a full life of male privilege and had a midlife crisis. They have to infiltrate everything

I'm sorry but in 2019 I'm kinda cringed out by the sheer number of women who have allowed someone to convince them biological sex isn't real& to give up the rights of other women without any solid evidence whatsoever to confirm this. I mean its not a complicated thing- biological sex is MATERIALLY evident- it takes some passivity to believe its not. Its one thing to know its bs and not speak out of fear...but its another entirely to actually buy into behind closed doors & be part of its manifestation throwing other women under the bus for some woke SJW points for a tiny mentally unstable minority. I think the latter set of women need to have an even stronger word with themselves than the former. As in they clearly need to learn to have humility/ assertiveness. Some of these women had to be told 28874329 examples of why this is a bad idea for them to finally get it- I think that signals ignorance.

I don't want to hear your feminist views if you're all fluff when it comes to defending our boundaries. Thats just lip service- and we need more action. We need more women that put their foot down when they're say they're going to

I never bought it- I remember the first time I got put in the hot seat for my views in a room full of lib fem students who already despised me for not being a hipster....and the minute I spoke up they fell silent and the trans lecturer called me transphobic...but you could tell on their faces they wanted to nod and agree. They were just scared.. & I thought WTF? Are we back in the 50s??? Whats the point having access to education/ right to vote if women aren't going to use their voices???!

I couldn't NOT say anything because it sounded so bullshit...and was being taught to people in higher education- I immediately wanted to debate what he was saying. It was like a lecturer claiming the earth is flat to a bunch of naive paying students

All for asking what happens to womens boundaries if we allow men to say they're women...that was my crime

Male medical professionals & investors? Absolutely nothing left wing about this deep down

Yes I agree the authorities are serious cowards- they have been infiltrated by political ideology & people are fast waking up to this BS. I think they can smell the lawsuits coming

This is why I have always been suspicious of people who are quick to defend 'authority' on that basis alone...if a doctor told you poison was good for you, would you believe it? I'm sure there's some arrogant gullible people who would & would readily argue with you about YOUR arrogance lmao

To me this just signals something off is happening with British healthcare- they have been selling bits off to private healthcare firms for some time. I truly believe one motivation for them doing this is to overwhelm the NHS with trans patients thus pushing it further into desperation that can only be 'saved' through more privatisation (I mean seriously- its costs MONEY to dish out these hormone blockers/medical transitions/mediate lifelong effects). And I believe this even more so because trans culture is very established/widespread in America where for profit healthcare is already the same  (they NEED customers= ¬£¬£¬£¬£). With free healthcare there is incentive to keep people well as that drains the government less & keeps costs down. Thus to me, this signals Britain's NHS moving towards a for profit structure.

And ofc the icing on the cake is that they can erode womens hard fought boundaries that they resent allowing us have (to a degree). Can't have equality if you can't tell who's who!!

Yeah exactly! People overlook this aspect when I mention it as if its a conspiracy but its really not. The NHS has been struggling for some time due to forced austerity since the financial crash etc...and quite frankly the NHS could do WITHOUT a huge influx of trans kids and all their complications adding to the bill. I mean the trans journey is quite a long & costly experience...and the government funded NHS has to foot the bill for taht.

If anyone is curious why TIMs insist on entering womens sports even though everyone can see they have an unfair advantage, in order for a sex change to be 100% and never mentioned again legally, they need to be included as women for sporting events. TIMs being banned from female sporting events would mean their actual sex would always have to be a matter of record. So they will fight this one to the death. It's probably going to be one of the things that sink in the court of public opinion because it's obvious even to the average sports fan a TIM has an unfair advantage over women.

You'll also notice the article avoids the fact that recent research is showing they maintain male muscle strength even after T blockers, and TIMs are two SD large than females. Which means an average size TIM has at least a 2SD head start in terms of strength on plain old Jane. This means only about only about 1/40 women is as strong or stronger as the average TIM.

EDIT: just realised a some of you won't know what 'SD' means. It's [standard deviation](http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) and it's referring to a distribution curve. The average man is 6 inches taller than the average woman. [Image to help you visualise what this means in terms of groups.](https://tall.life/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/New-height-distribution-with-legend.jpg) About one man in three is 6ft or over, and about 1% of women.

>	‚ÄúMale-to-female transgenders are not allowed to compete as females in our static strength sports as it is a direct competitive advantage,‚Äù wrote USAPL Therapeutic Use Exemptions Committee Chair Kristopher Hunt in an email to Cooper.

>	Hunt followed up with Cooper in January with this explanation:

>‚ÄúTransgender male to female individuals having gone through male puberty confer an unfair competitive advantage over non-transgender females due to increased bone density and muscle mass from pubertal exposure to testosterone.‚Äù

>	The ‚Äúbone density‚Äù red herring has been thrown out there for years, at least since MMA fighter Fallon Fox appeared on the scene. The bone density of black women is, on average, significantly higher than that of white women. In fact, some studies have shown the bone strength of black women to be higher than that of white men.


>	Yet we don‚Äôt see any great rush to divide lifting categories by race (which of course would be ridiculous), proving this bone-density argument to be nothing but a canard designed to specifically target trans athletes.

>	Hunt did not respond to an email requesting clarification.

>	Still, USA Powerlifting‚Äôs ban on transgender women competing as women is in place.

>‚ÄúUSA Powerlifting is not a fit for every athlete and for every medical condition or situation,‚Äù the organization said in a statement. ‚ÄúSimply, not all powerlifters are eligible to compete in USA Powerlifting.‚Äù

>	USA Powerlifting did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

>	The organization‚Äôs ban has forced Cooper to look for other opportunities to compete, landing her at events hosted by the U.S. Powerlifting Association. The USPA is smaller and holds fewer events in Cooper‚Äôs home state. But she‚Äôs happy to be able to compete.


>‚ÄúThey allow trans people to compete in their untested division,‚Äù Cooper said. ‚ÄúI won their Minnesota State Championship and it was amazing, but it still felt off knowing that I was denied eligibility for USA Powerlifting.‚Äù

613,VictoireHuguette,"Yes! Thank you for saying this. Clearly their idea of race is just as archaic as their conception of gender. As far as I am aware, biologically speaking, there is only one human race, and there are only two humans sexes. The fact there are some physical similarities between people of the same ethnical background doesn't mean there is a clear biological or genetical way of classifying people into the social ""races"" we know. It would be impossible to make racial categories in sport, since there would be no way of knowing who belongs where. There is however a pretty easy way of classifying people into the two human sexes. But they are trying so hard to forget about it, they seem to think the only clue we might have is their bone density."

Edit:   Here is another chart from NCBI:

617,CricketNiche,"Sounds like it's based on center of gravity. Men's center is their chest cavity/torso, but women's is our hip/pelvic area. Chinese women are shorter, so their center of gravity is lower and way more stable. A good strong foundation for lifting heavy things."

Semi-related, but there are many genetic disorders that are more prevalent in different parts of the world or among specific groups of people, as well as genetic differences that [have big implications for what medicines we need to properly treat people (and what we should be developing!](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/pharmacogenetics-personalized-medicine-and-race-744/))"
637,WillTheMadnessEnd,"Yes over years.  It depends like everything on how strong your bones were at its peak in young adulthood...

Weightlifters would have a much higher bone density than if they didn't do that sport  Lifting weights is recommended to build bone mass.  Comparing a man who transitioned recently, and a weightlifter at that,  to the senior transgenders in general is misleading and a red herring as usual.

Not sure if bone density as much to do as muscle and upper body strength, in weightlifting anyway.

Edit:

Also, after menopause, it is loss of 'estrogen' a that makes women susceptible to menopause.  Most probably it is the loss of testosterone in TIMs that make them susceptible.  It's quite complicated, but bone would lose density gradually over years, and I am wondering if the estrogen they take offsets the loss to a some degree."

There are genetic differences in different populations of people. These differences exist in hair type, skull shape and population genetics. Scientists can examine  skeletonized remains and determine what population of people they came from. They wouldn't be able to do that if humans weren't genetically different. How can anyone look at a European, an Eastern Asian and a person native to Sub Saharan Africa and not see that they are different genetically? And this difference goes way beyond just skin color."

648,CybergothiChe,"pack heat, shoot meat"
649,not_mean_enough,Great advice for getting arrested in most countries.
650,goblinf,"oh sorry. I didn't mean actual identity cards. I meant (in the UK) where when you become a client of say a solicitor you have to show them that you have existed for a long time, and they have to google you to check you don't fall into particular categories. So if someone has a name change, like say a Lord coming into an inheritance, they provide birth cert with birth name, then deed poll to current title, because the other documents will have the original name until the deed poll, then the new name afterwards. The system is created to cope with there being a change of name.  
Similarly if you are a woman and get married and take your husband's name, except there you provide the marriage certificate.

There's a continuity of ID.

Whereas withthe self ID legislation (that's just been kicked into the long grass here in the UK) there's an assumption that there's a prior 'dead name' that won't ever be used again. And the new name. Well that's just NOT feasible in a society that, for example, has antimoney laundering rules to protect against terrorism and crime. The protection has a higher public good than the attempt to stop dead naming.

Not sure that's any clearer. But basically, if you change your name, your old name/existence follows you. As Freddie the seahorse has found - the court said only women can give birth to kids, therefore your current name is on the birth certificate, under the mother box not the father box. The law is interested in what's going to make sense in society for the long term - not magical thinking currently in vogue.

We don't actually have ID cards in teh UK, it was mooted but there was such an outcry it didn't happen. Which is fine, until you don't have a passport or a driving licence, then since 9/11 and the changes in ID verification rules, doing anything official becomes a nightmare...."
651,villanelle23eve,"Still, it would be more fair to have an asian women's basketball team, for instance. It does seem like a racial advantage when one group is on average so much taller than the other."

653,xvmeadar,"Yeah, but then density is resultant from factors like activity and perhsps diet, not necessarily from race. I found a bit of issue with the ‚Äúblack women have higher bone density than white men‚Äù. There recently was a scandal when it was found that many doctors erroneously believed that black people have thicker skin than whites, and treated accordingly. 

Does testosterone or oestrogen contribute to higher bone density or lack thereof?"
654,,"Yep, it absolutely does"
655,,"That‚Äôs what kills me. Whenever the TRA‚Äôs rage about this shit, they‚Äôll point to one single factor and claim that it varies amongst women. And, yeah, these things *do* vary. Some women have a lower q-angle, other women are really tall, whatever. But the TRA‚Äôs choose not to acknowledge (and the uninformed general public seems to not fully understand) that it‚Äôs the *multiple, compounding* physiological differences between males and females that ultimately confers the advantage and warrants the ban."

658,VictoireHuguette,"Well good luck classifying people into these categories then. I can already see it ""this is a competition for 30% Irish 70% sub-saharian people only, sorry but you don't fit the pre requirements"". 
Of course there are genetic differences between ethnicities, there are even genetic differences between blonde people and red heads, and that doesn't make it a race.

""If the lesbians who don‚Äôt like dick see a post about lesbians who like dick (girl dick only obv) then they can ignore it. They need to work through their ‚Äúknee jerk reaction‚Äù bcuz it can become a transphobic reaction real quick.""

~~For many years, until the big blow-up last week, actuallesbians linked [this post](https://archive.is/iO8AP) on the sidebar.~~ Actually, they took it down briefly, but it's back up; this shit is *still* the official policy of bring/AL. The author of the post concedes that no one *has* to date transwomen, but makes it clear that if you don't date transwomen, it reflects poorly on your character:

>You aren't into penii *[sic]*. I get it, and for what it's worth neither am I. To be fair, many trans women who carry that particular anatomical burden are not big fans of it either, so you have that in common at least. But many trans women don't, and many of those who do won't for long. **Be careful about using this biased sample to rule out all trans women.**

>Also, **would you rule someone out because she had six toes?** Whenever I hear a straight man ask how sex works in the absence of a penis, I feel sorry for his girlfriends/wife, because he clearly doesn't understand how sexytimes work; **when I hear a lesbian rule out trans women because of the presence of a hidden penis I feel sorry for her partner, because how superficial is that?**

So yeah. There is actually immense, ubiquitous pressure on lesbians to be open to dating transwomen, and you clearly don't know what the fuck you're talking about."

Below is from an older article so I'm not sure what advances have been made. I'm also not sure what to make of the last two sentences of the abstract. The study itself requires payment to read. [Found ironic (?) typo in lead sentence.]

Orgasm in the postoperative transsexual.

Abstract

The dearth of information regarding organism [sic] in postoperative transsexuals prompted the authors to study its prevalence. The sample consisted of 14 male-to-female (M-F) and 9 female-to-male (F-M) postoperative transsexuals. The relationship of orgasm to sexual and general satisfaction was explored via a specially designed questionnaire. Orgastic capacity declined in the M-F group and increased in the (F-M) group. Despite the decrease in orgasm in the M-F group, satisfaction with sex and general satisfaction with the results of surgery were high in both groups. General satisfaction of 86% replicates other studies. Frequency of sex increased by 75% in the M-F group and by 100% in the F-M group. A phalloplasty does not appear to be a critical factor in orgasm or in sexual satisfaction. The general conclusion is reached that it is possible to change one's body image and sexual identity and be sexually satisfied despite inadequate sexual functioning."
771,amselmama,I think they try and attach the neophallus somewhat to the clitoris and I know Balian Bushbaum has talked about 'having sex as a man' but I honestly can't imagine it working
772,666777101,"Yh I agree that words should mean things, that's why I always make the distinction when speaking factually. If it's just everyday conversation kinda stuff I will use a trans persons preferred pronouns.

If we were talking about serious stuff like I dunno.. whether trans-women should be put in women's prisons, if they should be allowed to compete as women in sports, stuff like that.. then yeah I will tell it like it is and point out the fact that they are trans-women, not women."

794,Max-1995,"There‚Äôs a minority of people without dysphoria wearing the label ‚Äútrans‚Äù as a get out of jail free card. Those are the ones who are (generally, there‚Äôs bound to be some dysphoric people too) demanding sex from lesbians and suggesting that not liking penis is ‚Äúgynophilia‚Äù- a perverse attraction to female genitalia as opposed to the female sex- and that lesbians should re-examine that. 

If you don‚Äôt see why that‚Äôs a problem, you‚Äôre blind. Lesbians have to overcome compulsory heterosexuality, and imagine overcoming the hardest hurdle to accepting who you are, and then someone from inside your own house (lgbt community) says what sounds like the exact same thing. Here‚Äôs a helpful script. 

SOCIETY: You have to like dick, sleep with men. 

LESBIAN: I‚Äôve tried to overcome it but I just don‚Äôt like dick, I quite like women, actually. I think I‚Äôll date women from now on. 

LGBT COMMUNITY: You like women? That‚Äôs great. These women have dicks and you have to be open to sleeping with them because they are more vulnerable than you and women can have dicks. 

LESBIAN: Actually I just like vulva. I don‚Äôt want to be involved with a dick. 

LGBT COMMUNITY: WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU‚ÄôRE SAYING? You can‚Äôt say that!! There‚Äôs plenty of ways to have sex without PIV penetration, you know! 

And just real quick? Most of us have experienced this phenomenon. So I don‚Äôt understand where you get off, thinking you can come into our place and tell us how our experiences work. We have conversations here. We don‚Äôt just TELL each other how things are, that‚Äôs it, no other opinions."

Also, get the fuck out of our space. We don‚Äôt need a brainwashed fool who‚Äôs drank the ‚Äúfeels > reals‚Äù koolaid so hard to mansplain to us that our experiences didn‚Äôt happen and the misogyny/rape culture prominent within the TIM community doesn‚Äôt exist."

800,ABeerAndCheer,Voluntary FGM....imagine the privilege you have to have to be able to do this...while women in 3rd world countries have been trying to fight against this for ages.
801,crittimes,"Sure, many trans people may be more comfortable with their sexuality after transition and therefore more responsive and open. TIFs are taking testosterone which will boost sex drive and with nerves retained from clitoris, which is twice as enervated as penis, it makes physiological sense that TIFs are more sexually satisfied post surgery. I wish it were less sexually rewarding in terms of social consequences but at least I understand transitioning more, given this information. 

The bright point of what I read was that some TIMs will only masturbate rather than seek out sexual partners, due to the complexity of their genital situation. I honestly do feel badly for them but am relieved that the conflict of having TIMs pushing for sexual acceptance in lesbian social spaces may be lessened by some TIMs choosing to take things into their own hands. Sorry, I'm a pragmatist."
802,nonpenishaver,That's my thought.
803,Thatstealthygal,"I suspect as much. A TIF I know wrote on their blog, after starting T, that they were totally floored by how horny they were. Like, constantly horny. I gather it settles down a bit."

That's the way I see it anyway, I guess maybe a small part of me is rewarding them a little bit then.. but a trans-man with a full beard, flat chest and deep voice is no longer a woman to me, soo.. we have to call them something."

 I often interact with TIFs, as colleagues and clients. And every time I‚Äôm forced to say ‚Äúhe‚Äù there‚Äôs this metal grating sound inside my head. So, no.  When I see them I see a woman with a lot of self-hatred, and I have so very much compassion for them even when they‚Äôre acting like fucking assholes. But I can only have that compassion for them because I know they‚Äôre women who have internalized  so much misogyny that they‚Äôve tried to cut it out, cover it up, or poison it away."

A man who wears make up and 'feminine' things isnt trans if he says hes still a man who just likes those things (as Bowie and any number of musicians). A man who hates his body isnt automatically trans. A man who hates his genitals and wishes he has a vulva isnt trans. What makes a person trans is BELIEVING that they are a woman ""on the inside"" and that particular feeling or behaviors are evidence of that.

Miranda Yardley is a transsexual male (a man who had surgery to feminize his body including genital reconstruction) who now acknowledges that he is and always has been a man and that claiming to be a woman in any way is sexist and harmful. He speaks out on this a lot. He wears make up and wears his hair long but doesnt claim that he is ""socially presenting as a woman"" because that would be extremely sexist. He does NOT claim to be transgender and isnt considered to be transgender by the TQIA community. He uses ""transsexual"" to refer to the state of his male body."
854,remquarqk,"That would be fine.

I don't think the women here deny gender dysphoria exists and is a real problem. The problem is that this idea is now getting pushback because people think it's regressive and bigoted, as it's basically seeing being trans as a mental illness (which.....it is. Maybe the real problem is just the stigmatization of mental illnesses--at least in my pov that's a larger issue here. Not all mental illness is ""bad."" It's just not the norm.)

The problem is the definition of what 'trans' means is changing from dysphoria to an innate 'identity' that's affecting the legal system."

But breast augmentation is a great example of my point given the frequent and terrible side effects experienced by many patients.  Even in ideal circumstances, best practices would have future surgeries down the line as no implant is made to last for life."

They distinguish it from a ‚Äúbrozilian‚Äù or ‚Äúmanzilian‚Äù, which is the removal of all hair in this region from a person with a scrotum. Ms. Yaniv strongly objects to these terms on the basis that she is a woman and not a ‚Äúbro‚Äù or a ‚Äúman‚Äù.

Whilst I'm glad that these women won, the way they won seems a dangerous precedent as it states that it's specifically because he wanted a genital wax rather than an arm or leg wax that they were right to refuse him.

Just in case anyone is questioning this quote and whether this shit is really that common.
1007,TAgurl,"I used to wax both men and women. Every man who had genital waxing got an erection. 100%. Most were embarrassed about it and really apologetic, and there are ways as a professional to mitigate it (such as draping). You also typically have the man assist whilst you wax (to hold the skin taut - think scrotal skin); to have them ‚Äòhandle‚Äô their junk when it‚Äôs erect. 

Mostly, getting an erection was an automatic response to being touched. They do not last long, especially once the pain starts (don‚Äôt want it to seem as if men have them the entire appointment). 

It was not uncommon for a man to try to request more, or to suss out whether you‚Äôd offer more. Usually they tried to be subtle about it (they weren‚Äôt), but some outright asked, or just started talking sexually. They never tried this at the beginning of the appointment, all asked whilst well into the waxing. 

I once had an old guy start commenting on how he loved hot wax dripped on his balls. 

Some men outright begged you to ‚Äòfinish them off‚Äô, and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs always the creepy, feral men. I had many extremely attractive men hint or blatantly ask for sexual services. You have to presume that many of these men were partnered.

Didn‚Äôt matter whether the salon was highly reputable, or a suburban corner shop, both ends of the spectrum experienced unwanted sexual conduct from men. 

Unfortunately, if you‚Äôre going to offer intimate waxing for men you must have policies in place to handle these situations as they WILL occur."
1008,quasarbar,">estheticians who are not trained in male genital waxing should not attempt to wax a penis and scrotum due to the risk of serious injury to the customer

&#x200B;

They don't seem to understand that the trans inclusive laws they champion are exactly what empowered Yaniv to use the Canadian government to punish immigrant women for the ""crime"" of refusing to touch his genitals. And that he used the Protected Class status of trans-women to evade punishment/judgement for doing shit that would have landed anyone else in jail. It doesn't matter if 99% of TiMs are saints. The point still stands that these laws empower shady men to do exactly what Yaniv did; and that problem needs to be acknowledged and addressed.

Yaniv is only catching heat for this because his Lady LARP is so cartoonishly pervy and gross that even hardcore activists like Morgane Oger had to publicly distance themselves from him. Can you imagine how many AGPs are pulling similar shit and we're just not hearing about it because those other men aren't total morons who broadcast every creepy thing they do like Yaniv does?"
1024,PollyannaPenny,"> If not for Yaniv's abhorrent behaviour, it looks like the tribunal would have found against those two women.

This is a ***VERY*** good point. 

I honestly believe that the only reason Yaniv lost this case was because he's a cartoonishly creepy freak who broadcasted his intentions to screw over immigrant women, blatantly lied in court, has a documented history of sexually predatory behavior, attracted international attention/embarrassment with his antics, and basically embodies every negative stereotype of an AGP we can think of.

If Yaniv wasn't a total moron who left receipts of his bad behavior all over the internet; he probably would have won this case."
1025,swspecial,It was his racism and him getting permanently documented on places like the farms that sunk him. Not so much the sexism underlying his behavior. And that makes me uncomfortable.

this should stand as a sort of caution sign, I think. *attention: you ladies got lucky.* next time, there will be a skilled and sympathetic manipulator. no one will have thought they needed to specify who they meant (or itemize body parts) when they said ‚Äúwomen.‚Äù they‚Äôll learn that ignorance of the new language, which they didn‚Äôt even realize they were speaking, is no excuse."

Yaniv was able to do this because he claimed genital waxing was necessary ""gender affirming care"". So these salon workers were literally killing his inner woman by refusing to give him a ""lady wax"".

Never mind the fact that the VAST majority of actual females never get a genital wax (so it's not needed for any dude's Lady LARP).

Eventually, after having to take it to the US supreme court. But in this situation, both the Colorado courts and the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (CCRC) most certainly attempted to impose requirements on another group. Both the initial ruling and the appeal in Colorado was in favor of the plaintiffs. From the wiki article:

 *The case was decided in favor of the plaintiffs; the cake shop was ordered not only to provide cakes to same-sex marriages, but to ""change its company policies, provide 'comprehensive staff training' regarding public accommodations discrimination, and provide quarterly reports for the next two years regarding steps it has taken to come into compliance and whether it has turned away any prospective customers.""* 

Worryingly (in my opinion), SCOTUS did NOT rule that the baker had a right to refuse to create a custom wedding cake for these two gentlemen's wedding. (For what it's worth, the baker never refused to *sell* the couple a cake. He refused to make them a custom cake.) They simply reversed the original rulings based on the CCRC's blatant hostility to the baker's Christianity, which they stated violated his first amendment rights. This leaves the door open for further attempts by woke organizations like the CCRC to impose its ideologies on private citizens. 

As an aside, after SCOTUS's ruling, the CCRC decided to drop a second case against this baker, which they had brought after he refused to make a custom cake for a TIM to celebrate his transition.

&#x200B;

> Denying a service to someone because they have a different religious beliefs than you is different than forcing others to police their language, deny sex based protections and touch their genitals. 

I'm not arguing that the two cases or situations are all that similar. I was simply arguing against Kabloona's statement that legalization of gay marriage does/did not impose requirements on other groups. Because there were and are quite a few organizations who are using gay marriage to do just that. Gay marriage isn't the problem. I don't even think liberalism is the problem here. It's identity politics and how it fucks us all. It takes anything regarded as ""minority"" and tries to force all of us to worship at its frequently cock-shaped altar.

All that being said, I'd argue that it's beyond absurd that either of these cases were ever even in front of a court. The country of Canada needs a judge to rule that women should not be compelled to touch a man's penis. This is fucking crazy. The US *couldn't even get a court to rule* that a local small time baker can't be forced to bake a cake for a function he doesn't agree with. Not as crazy, but pretty fucking crazy."

> Professor C√°el Keegan, who teaches Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, said the hat's reference to pink [vulvas] is suspect: *""We know that any time feminism starts centering people based on anatomy, that gets kind of dangerous for trans people.""* **He** also pointed out that both cisgender women and transgender women are fighting for autonomy over their own bodies. The hat's allusion to the [vulva] also ignores the fact that some transgender women opt against undergoing gender-affirmation surgery. Keegan said that the pussyhat can promote the unconscious suggestion that only cisgender women are raped, which is untrue. In fact, he explained, ""A lot of the reasons [transgender women] are attacked is because they do not possess that piece of anatomy.""

Feminism centering people who are female, no fucking way?? Women talking about their anatomy is dangerous for men LOL I can't even, this is too much for me."

And women did try and succeeded in working underground in coal mines - despite being BARRED in many places by men. So, even if women could work the mines men banned them. Or, if they weren't outright banned, they sexually harassed, raped, not taught safety regulations by men so the women would get injured...""Women in Coal Mining West Virginia"" is a Medium article that talks all about how those noble male coal miners treated their female coworkers.

What if some women don't care if they're beautiful and if men find them beautiful ? What if they don't give much thought about their appearance bc it's not in their personalities?

When i was a teen i thought i was fat even though looking back on pics i was a tall skinny bean with long legs. But when i sit down my thighs would appear larger (like it does for every damn human being) so i thought i was fat. I also had a phase of internalized misogyny where i dressed with baggy clothes and despised girly girls and thought acting like a dude was cool. I've also had body hate for some of my features like my nose bc i was heavily bullied on it. I literally thought i looked monstruous just bc my nose is bulbous, and that everybody was looking at me in horror.

1412,vulvapeople,"Your husband is going to bankrupt you, and, as another commenter has mentioned, could very well be putting you in the position of paying him alimony and child support when you finally get fed up with all of this.

Once he becomes a ""stay at home wife/mother"", I know and you know and everyone here knows that you will continue to do 99 percent of the housework and child care while he studies and does his nails.

If you have another baby, he's going to breastfeed it and expose it to the cocktail of chemicals he's on to make lactation possible. If you don't approve, likely he'll do it behind your back.

Also, men don't have a good track record with paying back their wives when their wives work to put them through school. If he does manage to get through school and get a job (but knowing how TIMs like this operate, more likely he's trying to be a leech), you will see none of that money as his wife or as his ex-wife.

Lastly, is the trust fund just for you, as in he's not a beneficiary? This is your opportunity to get the hell out of this marriage, pay off your share of *his* debt, and make sure he doesn't get his grubby hands on the money *your* relative gave you."

No sorry! So many people who turn up here start with some version of ""Sorry."" It's ok! You're allowed to rant. We're not going to hurt you and you have every right in the world to be heard.

>Honestly I was originally going to post this in relationships, or the sub for spouses of trans people, but a friend suggested here.

If I said ""Yeah you probably would have gotten shouted down."" that would be isolating behavior, which I absolutely don't want to do. Instead I'll say ""We have seen other people post in those subs in the past and they were shouted down."" If, however, you are seeking alternative points of view, their input may be valuable.

>(Like she wanted to jump straight to breastfeeding despite barely being into her transition; it was costly and not something, from our research, that would help our baby much if at all and would purely be for her benefit. In the end the cost made her agree to put the idea aside (but not without a lot of tears from both of us)).

Holy shit, yeah. I'm glad this fell through. Male bodies cannot make the breastmilk you would have needed for your babies health. While it's true that male humans can lactate, it is ABSOLUTELY not the same thing nutritionally speaking as the breastmilk of a mother. I'm sure you know this already, since you *are* a mom, but you have different ""milks"" based on how far you are from the baby's birth, and each stage of that milk is balanced in such a way as to keep the baby healthy and alive. It changes. Male milk doesn't.

Another critically important thing on the milk subject is that you produce sugars in your milk meant to feed your baby's symbiotic bacteria so they protect the baby from harmful outside bacteria (not the baby itself, your child actually can't digest or use those sugars when they're a newborn). Male milk can't do that either.

&#x200B;

>My wife is high maintenance. She gets to go to a nice salon for her hair care and waxing needs, she owns a dozen nice bras, she has a complicated skin routine, she gets to tan and get new clothes and owns way more shoes then I do.

Regardless of whether or not this person is trans. If one parent is saving for the children and the other is doing this crap, then they would be seen- rightfully so- an an irresponsible parent. They don't get a pass. 

&#x200B;

>She still gets home, eats dinner with us, *then hangs out in the kitchen with me and the kids while I do the dishes and clean up*. She tells me about her day. I like this part honestly, but I wish she would help because it would get done a lot faster if both of us were doing it.

Can't even be bothered to help you clean up and give you a chance to hang out with your children? That's shitty behavior. Again, this person doesn't get a pass just because they're trans.

1417,konradosho,"Oh. My. Lord. I want to say this first: I am so sorry you are going through this, I truly understand what it is like to love someone who does not deserve your love.

I‚Äôll tell you what, though. *You* deserve to be loved. What this man is doing to you is not love.

This is an extremely abusive relationship. Your wife/husband/whatever the hell he wants to call himself or identify as (does not matter) is an abuser. His behavior is so entitled and selfish that it‚Äôs comical. How the hell can a grown ass adult think it‚Äôs even remotely acceptable to take advantage of his spouse like this? You are literally going without things you need (like BRAS) because he all of a sudden decided that he wanted to live out his fantasy of what a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is?

Everyone says this, but get a lawyer. Once you divorce that guy he is probably going to try and sue for custody and he is obviously not deserving of that. And for the love of god do NOT SHARE ANY OF YOUR TRUST MONEY WITH HIM. You‚Äôve got to protect yourself and you‚Äôve got to protect your kids, and money can give you a means of achieving that protection. I repeat, DO NOT GIVE THIS MAN ANY MONEY. 

Keep thinking about the welfare of your babies, too. This is not someone they should be around, and he likely hangs out with people that could potentially hurt them. Your kids are way more important than anything he‚Äôll cry about, way more important than his goddamned hucow pregnancy fetish (that‚Äôs literally what this shit is), his cross dressing and his narcissism.

Going forward, document EVERYTHING, especially those credit card expenses. Do NOT let this person have a dime of YOUR inheritance--  he's already put y'all in debt with no regard to your family's financial needs.  If you're not on contraception, get on it NOW (men make jokes about women ""trapping"" them when they're no better üôÑ), the last thing you need are an influx of hormones clouding your judgment. Before you leave, have an exit strategy with support on hand, just in case. 

 It's very telling how your partner wants to experience ""motherhood "" when there have been daily opportunities to parent their children and refuse to do so. He wants a start over on your dime, haven't you given enough?  

It is not on you to validate him,  it's not your responsibility to sacrifice so he can feel whole,  your ONLY responsibilities are to yourself and children --kudos for finding the strength to do just that.

1427,jelliknight,"This is so gross and extreme it almost looks fake.  


Your husband started transitioning while you were pregnant? That's really common. They cant stand someone else being the center of attention.  


Then he wanted to breastfeed? That's *sick.* As you said, it wouldn't do anything to benefit the baby, it's all about him getting what he wants. He wants to use your infant as a prop at best and a sex toy at worst. Then he cried over not being allowed to waste your very tight money on abusing your infant??  


Now he's driving you into debt for his vanity. He doesn't do his share of the childcare or housework.  


""I'm treated like the help"" That's what you are. You are not in a marriage and from the looks of it you never have been. You are his servant. Your life is only to support him.  


""A relative of mine left a trust fund to be given to me when I turn 30. That's in six months"" That's why he's still around. I was wondering, usually they transition while the wife is pregnant, and then once the baby is a toddler they start sleeping around and eventually ditch her to life a life of 'freedom' with their new trans friends. I was wondering why he was still around and here it is, he wants to live his life of freedom on your money. As soon as it goes in to your shared accounts he will be entitled to use it and he will. Divorce will take longer than 6 months. Find a way to delay this or immediately put it into a savings account in your name only that can't be touched for another few years. If you don't he will leave you broke with two kids, I guarantee it.  


Separate now, don't wait another day. Yes he has always been this selfish. No he will never change. You have never been in a marriage, you have been a prop in his fantasy life. A marriage is an equal partnership. You never had that. It sounds like you had a fucked up childhood and that damaged your expectations for what a relationship should be. Don't let your kids suffer the same way. Show them how a person respects themselves."
1428,fuckincaillou,"> My older brother has already received his inheritance and is fully willing to let me borrow as much as I need for a good lawyer.

This alone says so much more than you might realize. To me, it says that even on the outside looking in, your brother knows something isn't right with your marriage even beyond the trans aspects. That your brother is, as a man, looking at the track record of your wife/husband and finding it lacking. The trans aspect of this situation is just the candy coating most people might see first, hiding the truth of the matter, which is that your wife/husband does not partake equally in homemaking, childrearing, or financially."

If I were in your shoes, I would lawyer up and divorce this guy ASAP especially considering the trust fund paying out in a few months. And if the trust fund pays out in a lump sum, read ASAP in bold and italics and discreetly consult a lawyer regarding how to maintain sole control over and benefit of it while you're married and while in the process of divorce.

I know I wouldn't want to go through life and raise kids with someone who isn't in it as a partner. And I'd wager that if you stick around and give him access to the trust fund, that money is going to be gone.

1434,DextersXXarmy,"I never use Reddit and signed up just to respond to this, because I have a friend that went through this exact thing, and a few others that had to deal w the courts regarding custody/divorce/abuse:

PLEASE DO NOT underestimate your spouse. At all. Never assume you know how they will respond. This is hard to do because you feel you know them, but this an abusive, dangerously entitled, male. I would not put it past them to be dangerous or vidictive when told they cannot have what they want. You have kids, which they may see as a way to hurt or control you.

You're seeing the very best of their behavior right now because you have something they want- inheritance and a chance to play mommy. What's going to happen once they realize their meal ticket AND validation is leaving? *Hopefully nothing*, but it's best to plan for the very worst, because telling men NO brings out their rage. And telling a man NO that is entitled enough to ""play woman"" on your dime is likely to be even worse. 

In practical terms, this means planning quietly and making sure you have a safety plan in place. It may seem extreme, but if you can talk to a DV specialist about how to safely leave, you really should. It cannot hurt. 

Document EVERYTHING, and save every single text, phone call, email, everything. Get an app that records everything off your device. Write doen everything they have done that has been harmful. Never say or type anything that you wouldn't want read in court.

I know this sounds majorly paranoid, but I watched a few friends get trounced in court by (and lose custody to) abusers, because they tried to be conciliatory and reasonable. The abusers had every text, my friends did not. Even little things like being 10 min late a few times adds up when read to the court. 

Be a shark, even though you might want to be the bigger person, so you don't lose custody and end up paying this asshole support too. 

Also- you mentioned moving. It's ok to try to position yourself in the best possible place to win. I guarantee your spouce will take every advantage they can, and hes starting ahead of you. Do your homework and try to get the odds in your favor. I'm so happy you can get a lawyer because that will make all the difference.

Like when they act like you‚Äôre the help and make no effort to include you in conversations, at your own house. You are clearly a strong woman who has stuff going for her. Your wife is lucky to have you, holding everything down. Tread carefully with therapy as many therapists are in the transcult and will fall for the pity parties and crocodile tears. Beware that it seems like your wife might be jealous of you, which is simply misogyny since he is jealous of the seemingly good things about being female and doesn‚Äôt know half of the negatives. This spending issue would have me extremely worried. If he wants fancy clothes maybe he could find a thrift store. IF I were you I would be doing anything to protect the oncoming assets for the benefit of your children, screw letting him blow it all. I was raised in a family with narcissistic traits, trust me, he will have no qualms spending it all on himself on shit he don‚Äôt need and leaving nothing for you and the kids. Please take care"
1436,MarkTwainiac,"OP, I am so sorry you are dealing with such a selfish spouse who has gaslighted you in so many ways. Your story brought tears to my eyes, made me glad I'm divorced & long single, & called to my mind a question attributed to Dorothy Parker: what fresh hell is this?

I agree with all the other posters so far, but thought it might be helpful to add one point: It's not clear where you are from, but if you are from the USA, please be aware that states vary in how they view wealth inherited before as well as during a marriage. In some states, inherited wealth is included in community property; in other states, it's totally excluded. So depending on where you live, your spouse might not have a valid claim to/on your inheritance. A good lawyer can advise.

Also, there's no need to borrow money in order to consult a divorce or matrimonial lawyer. With top-flight matrimonial attorneys in the US, the first appointment & attendant advice is always free - & if it's not, the lawyer is probably an unethical shyster.  What's more, if you are coming into an inheritance in the foreseeable future, any decent divorce or matrimonial attorney will take you on (if you want) & bill you later.  They are accustomed to this.

I feel for you & wish you & your kids all the best."

Let's put this in gender-neutral terms: your partner is driving you into debt because they need money to maintain a certain image of themselves.

Your partner is making selfish plans with your family's money (presumably left to you because your relative loves *you* and wants *you* to get a little boost in security). You deserve so much better. 

And, in case anyone calls you a transphobe, please remember this: in the most charitable, pro-trans terms, transition is a lifelong medical, psychological, and physical journey. Your spouse, in other words, isn't going to stop wanting maternal experiences or a certain expensive aesthetic. You're doing the kind thing by letting them pursue that freely."

Recognize though that your wife is getting a support network from her new friends who are backing her narcissistic thinking and making all of this easier to enforce.  You need to be spending time with people who are going to back you and who are going to be pulling you away from trans cult talk and into rational lets treat people on their actions talk.

He didn‚Äôt want any of the bad parts of being a woman and he told me I should agree with him all the time and pretend he‚Äôs smarter than me, like the sexist man he is.

Your spouse has a track record of selfish behavior and reckless spending which is unlikely to change. You are worth more than that, you deserve to be treated with respect.

Take your kids and get out now. See a lawyer about making sure he can't touch that trust fund. Get your car, go to college, look after yourself and your children. He abandoned you all already for his weird fetish. Return the favour. Build the life you want and deserve.

As I was reading, all I was thinking was ""would you accept this behaviour if he was still your husband?"". Would *anybody* expect you to tolerate a man behaving like this towards you? Would you doubt yourself even a little if a man put your family in debt for vain desires, wanted to take your maternity leave, demanded to be the one who got the education and the new car, refused to do any kind of chores?

If you stay, you will disappear. You will stop being a person. You will be this man's wallet, womb and comforter. Your entire life will center around what he thinks he wants. And if you wake up from that, you will never forgive yourself. Leave now while you can. Nothing is stopping you. Leave.

I would discuss this quickly with a divorce lawyer and figure out how to protect your assets. Those assets are going to be needed to support yourself and your children and not the uncontrolled spending of your partner. 

In most states, just leaving the marital home is the start of an unofficial separation and any moneys made after that aren‚Äôt considered community property. But leaving the home could also be considered abandonment depending on the state and if you own your current house it could also be construed as you giving up claims to it. Again...all that depends on your state. 

I would work as fast and quickly as possible to serve her with paperwork in order to get the ball rolling. And clearly they have zero concern for your well being, your mental health, fiscal health or your children.  This is beyond unacceptable and absolutely selfish on their part. 

You deserve a partner who is actually your partner. There is nothing here that shows they are anything else but completely selfish at this point.

1 my dad behaved the same way, he usted to buy for him the best clothes, the best shoes etc while my mother would never buy anything for herself even nowadays she struggles to get nice things for herself she would always prefer to buy things for me and my sister 
2. My dad always said she worked more than my mom but is not true , he had a full time job and my mom a middle time but she was the one who did  all the housework and also took care my sis and me (we were very difficult children because we usted to be sick all the time ) he would never ever took us to a Dr appointment, or pay for any kind of treatment 
3. He would always say he paid all the bills but it was not true he used to made the as my mom but still he wanted her to paid for everything ( and you know what he did all the money he got he was burning it all with his mistresses) when my sis or I asked him something for school o whatever he would yell at us and be very aggressive no matter if we were teens of toddlers 
4. He would be very mean to my mother also with my sister and I but with his friends he would always be super kind and supportive so if my mother complained about him nobody would believe her 
Those are just some examples but what I want you to see is that you don‚Äôt have to be afraid  to leave her I want you to take all the anger and desperation you feel to set you free from this situation because it only gets more horrible as time passes I want you to take the best decision FOR YOU, because this person is going to suck the life away from you and when she gets done she won‚Äôt think twice to leave you after all the sacrifices you‚Äôd done, this people don‚Äôt change regardless of their gender, you will never archive your dreams if you stay with her , she doesn‚Äôt care about her family 
I know you are going to say I have a ton a daddy issues or whatever but at the most important thing I want to realize is that you are just in time to change your story and your children‚Äôs (we do notice with the time that thing are not ok, one way or another)

I would talk to a lawyer and try to understand the financial situation better ‚Äî the specifics will depend on what state you‚Äôre in.  Usually an inheritance is considered separate property, and you should make sure you keep it separate and anything you buy with it from all the other marital assets.  You probably should NOT pay off debt that your husband incurred with that money.  Ask the lawyer how his debt is treated, etc.  you may or may not be liable for it.

Even if the trans component was not a factor, it would still be regarded as an abusive relationship, both mental and financial abuse. It won't improve, and will only get worse until you trust has been exhausted, then he will leave you. As one or two have said, I would also get the advice from a women's DV centre, because when this person gets wind that the money he planned to use for yet more frilly bras is about to be taken away, things could go badly really quickly. As Dexter and a few others recommended, do your planning on the quiet, and I would add, delete this thread soon.

We know he is manipulating you ‚Äî he apparently can no longer do chores like mow the lawn, because it 'triggers his gender dysphoria' ‚Äî yet has no qualms in using a penis to impregnate you (something he also did 'as a man'). Rather *selective dysphoria*. You are being played. Get out while you can, and before any more financial and emotional damage is done.

The best decisions about the future can only be made based on what you know in the present. You know that money is being taken away from you and your kids.

Given the current situation you'll be slaving away with a third child in ratty second hand clothes while you're spouse lives like a king and enjoys the fruits of what your family intended for you.

Your spouse does nothing around the house, no inside or outside chores. He goes to work, comes home and while you're slaving away he shares his stories and problems but never offers to help. Your partner can't take care of the kids. There is no partnership. They're doing nothing to support you and to hold up their end. Instead it's just taking and taking.

1516,AssignedMomAtBirth,"I‚Äôm so sorry that you are going through this. Have you read about autogynephelia ? If not, you need to. Your husband sounds like a textbook example.  Autogynephilia, or transvestic fetishism, is a sexual paraphillia. And sexual paraphillias tend to cluster.  For example , Many autogynephiles are also exhibitionists, masochists, ‚Äúadult babies‚Äù. Pediphiles, Etc. I would get on his computer and search his porn use  to see what you are dealing with at once, and find out how to document it legally in case you need it for custody / divorce.  If you find something really unsettling, you may need to call a lawyer or even the police. Be ready for that possibility when you do this. There is also an overlap of autogynephelia with personality disorders and narcissism. And when they take hormones, they can become very unstable. This is all very damaging to you and the kids. I would suggest that you get out of the marriage at once.  Stay with relatives or something until you can get your money and a new job home and school for your kids , a divorce and pay off debt. 

One other thing I need to say is that your baby should NOT be breastfed by a transitioning male via chemically induced lactation.  This has been done once at Mt Sinai using dangerous drugs.  there are no studies to prove that this is safe for the baby, and even if there were , I wouldn‚Äôt trust them. Common sense says NO to this.  It‚Äôs likely part of his particular fetish , as could be pregnancy and periods. Jamie Shoupe  is a former transwomen who had autogynephelia and is very open about his experience. If you want to help your husband you need to be honest with him that he isn‚Äôt a women but he has a fetish which has spiraled out of control and it‚Äôs destroying your family.  If he is reasonable he will recognize this and seek help. Therapy cbt and Drugs can be taken to reduce compulsion and depression that come with cross dressing. This is the better way to deal with things as opposed to enabling his delusion.  

There is a community of trans widows.  I  met one recently and I‚Äôve seen many posts from them on twitter and reddit. 

Again I‚Äôm really sorry that you are going though this.

Also , You need to prioritize your own health and safety and that of the kids and stop being a doormat for your abusive husband.  If you choose to stay, rules need to be set for equal distribution of work , childcare, spending  and chores. Debt needs to be paid off at once and no more shopping/ hair/nail for hubby until you‚Äôre in a position to afford that sort of expense. You‚Äôll probably need a lot of money for CBT therapy and medications for your husband. Is that how you want to spend your inheritance ? 

And absolutely NO male babysitters, period.  That includes transwomen. Sorry, there are just way too many stories of sexual abuse to take that risk. 

Good luck to you."
1517,lala4now,Honestly I don't see this as a trans issue so much as it being about your husband not being the person you married anymore. Which happens sometimes. People change. It sucks.

You deserve the chance to go back to college, you deserve the support someone who bore a child needs, and you may be friends... but for your kids sake you need to get out. Kids shouldn‚Äôt grow up seeing a dynamic like that, kids shouldn‚Äôt grow up learning that ‚Äúbeing trans‚Äù will get you out of sticky situations... I would post it to relationship advice, but don‚Äôt mention anything about trans, ask it as if it was a guy ‚Äúspraying cologne‚Äù and ‚Äúbuying a bunch of nice suits‚Äù I‚Äôd be interested to see what they think"
1519,UCalledDownTheThundr,"I'm so sorry, what a nightmare. You're right, you need to leave this person ASAP. Not just for your sake, but for your kids' too. I know it's scary, but it doesn't even sound like he'll be a big loss once you've broken free. Good luck to you! Stay strong!"
1520,hedaleksa,"I hope you take your kids and take YOUR trust fund and run. Regardless of gender that behavior is self centered and immature. The worst being that as a parent they needed help caring for their own kids for a hot minute (how do they think you do it all the time?) and the maternity leave thing...fuck no! Like really they think that you should have a baby and go back to work so they can take your money and stay home with a baby when it‚Äôs your body that‚Äôs healing, when it‚Äôs your body that‚Äôs equipped to feed that baby? RUN RUN RUN don‚Äôt feel bad don‚Äôt look back I hope they don‚Äôt get any kind of alimony from you in the divorce they don‚Äôt deserve it. Leave her with her credit card debt and temper tantrums and run!"
1521,,"I would say get out before you get your inheritance money. Your partner sounds lazy, selfish, and emotionally immature, and I think your partner might try to keep the money to himself if he gets a hold of it. This could lead to financial abuse, and him controlling you with the money. Get out now and make sure you keep the money away from him."
1522,MarionetteLady,"Wow, if it makes you feel better. You'll probably be canonised when you die. 

Nobody in the world would possible judge you for getting out, you're still young and from when you've written seem to be doing the lions share of everything without any support. I mean, the fact that your partner wants you to pop out another baby so they can enact out their maternity leave fantasy while you slog onwards. What an SOB. 

I don't know you, but you deserve better and your partner needs a wake up call if that's even possible at this stage. Which I doubt."
1523,raging-herbivore,"Your partner is abusive. There are many types of abuse, and he fits several (financial, emotional, etc.) Your partner does not care about you or your kids if he‚Äôs putting his own aesthetic desires above his family‚Äôs needs. It‚Äôs great that your brother is willing to help; take advantage of it. You are making the right decision, and you‚Äôve got lots of people here who support you. Stay strong. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1524,daughersmom,"I'm sure you've discovered in looking online that ALL of the available advice is about how you need to help your husband become the woman he thinks he's always been.  No sign of the fact that living with a full-blown narcissist is damaging to you and your kids and that YOU ARE BEING ABUSED.  Don't believe the hype.  You need to take care of yourself and your kids and stop catering to this abuser.  Leave.  Take your kids.  Contact a domestic abuse hotline.  they might be able to connect you with a shelter in the state you desire to live in.  Lie like a rug.  Don't give him a single clue about what you're planning.  There's no reason to think that he won't continue manipulating you the way he has been.  And, if he thinks he can't get his way, there's also no reason to think he won't use physical means to keep you in place.  

Right now, all you can think about is your kids.  Let that motivate you.  So many of these guys are paedophiles and abusers.  Not all, but a lot.  I hope when you get yourself detangled from this mess, you will take the time to take care of yourself as well.  Many spouses have ended up with basically PTSD after enduring the craziness of these situations.

Take care and good luck!"

People might give you crap because your husband identifies as trans, but remember that you don't owe anyone an explanation. If people bug you about it just tell them it's personal and you don't want to talk about it."
1526,Simbulmyn,"I'd get out. It sounds like he fetishises the parts of femininity he likes like dressing cute and breast feeding babies. That's actually a pattern with men who claim to be women. Get out. He'll only demand more emotional labor from you, more financial support from you, and if you fail to comply you'll be an evil transphobe. Save your sanity and your kids. Get out."
1527,BlackSwallowtail,Really glad you're getting out of this mess. I really hope it goes by with as few hitches as possible and that he doesn't try to fight for custody.

Please, PLEASE don't let them take the money and I'd really avoid another pregnancy like it were the plague b/c it just seems like a good way of trapping you into the relationship even more.

Having dealt with narcissistic partners myself, I encourage you to leave now.  I think you may be in physical danger right now.  Even if violence was never part of the relationship before, do you think that's not Plan B when Mr. Asshole realizes he's losing out on the free play money?  He'll throw you against the wall and stomp on your neck before you even talk to that lawyer.  Get out of the house now.  Pack a suitcase with valuables and the papers you need, take the kids and go to your brother, a shelter, a hotel, anywhere.  What do you think his mental process is right now?  People like him are psychic where their interests are concerned.   HE KNOWS you aren't happy and are getting uppity.  Run right now.  It won't hurt your case, it will help it actually.   Signed, ex gf of a formerly sweet sensitive guy who pulled a gun on me when I wanted to leave the relationship.  I got out of there by apologizing profusely for not understanding him.  It was in the middle of the night, I spent the night in my car.  Before that, there was never a hint of violence.  Do you get it, that's always Plan B for this type of guy.  Also, if he kills you, he will get away with it, because, don't you know, it was a sex game gone wrong."

1533,bluelustreak,"GET OUT. Your spouse is a selfish person who is bleeding you dry. Gender identity has nothing to do with this fact. You're not a bad person for leaving someone who makes you work this hard. Men may identify as women but they don't change. I was just reading about how men are far more likely to leave a wife for getting sick than the other way around. Women are far more loyal. The way your spouse is acting you can probably expect he would keep acting like a  man as he is doing now, expecting you do to do all the home labor, and if you get sick will be on his way. It's important that you don't let this notion that he isn't a man somehow make you believe he's different than other men. ALL MEN tell you they are not like other men and they can be trusted when they are working to best take advantage of you. Run. Take your money and go. And spend it on YOURSELF. You will find someone who treasures you and does his share if you treasure yourself and stop over taxing yourself to keep someone so hard to please happy."

1539,cliteralviolence,"This is such typical male behavior. You do everything and he still manages to act like this... no appreciation for you and his idea of womanhood seems hypersexualized and over-the-top so I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs what we call an autogynephile, a man who takes erotic pleasure in seeing himself as a woman. It‚Äôs not his dysphoria that‚Äôs keeping him from chores, it‚Äôs his male entitlement to female labor, he‚Äôs manipulating you. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he wanted to breast feed for sexual reasons. I bet his porn history would reveal a lot of misogynist crap. I mean, it‚Äôs already obvious he‚Äôs a misogynist."

I don't think that we are biased in your favour. It's just that here we think women are not slaves and deserve their own happiness, exactly as everyone else.
Your situation, but with reversed sexes (careless mother), would be considered awful and his mother would be advising him to divorce you. No one would be this understanding with a flawed female. Society demands very much from us but forgives men and find excuses for them.
I'm very sorry for what you're experiencing.
I just wanted to add that I find very odd his way of dealing with dysphoria: working out at the gym doesn't increase his muscles? And more importantly, fathering a third child (impregnating his wife with his penis) doesn't trigger his dysphoria?
This guy is not transitioning. He's only putting make up on his face. And everyone in his family is siding with him regardless of his wrongdoings, which is very dangerous for you. Don't buy their emotional blackmail. You're right to be concerned and you have the right to live a peaceful live. That you choose not to jump into a deep well is not selfish. It's the sensible thing to do, for you and your kids."

&#x200B;

""Last month she got mad at me for washing one of her lacy bras with my  sports bras, upset enough to the point of crying and all I could do was  stand there staring at this grown woman sobbing because a bit of lace  came off her bra"" *This is a form of emotional abuse.*

&#x200B;

"" I have three bras and they're ratty sports bras..."", "" My wife is high maintenance. She gets to  go to a nice salon for her hair care and waxing needs, she owns a dozen  nice bras, she has a complicated skin routine, she gets to tan and get  new clothes and owns way more shoes then I do.

We cannot afford this. 95% of our credit card debt is from her high maintenance needs."" *What you're describing here is financial abuse. It isn't okay that you're barely getting the necessities you need, but your spouse spends like crazy.*

&#x200B;

""She's literally never been alone with our children for any significant  amount of time. I left her and the kids for four days last year for a  friend's out of state wedding (that friend paid for, and we didn't feel  comfortable asking her to pay for the whole family), and she couldn't  handle that."" *You're spouse is a narcissist, and so the kids are only good when they're fun.*

&#x200B;

""I'm so sick of it all. She won't have a real conversation, instead she  just bursts into tears, has excuses or just gets mad and tells me she  needs some alone time if I try to talk to her about anything. "" *More narcissism.*

&#x200B;

""A relative of mine left a trust fund to be given to me when I turn 30.  That's in six months. The plan was to pay off all our debt, get me a new  car because my current one is on its last legs, and for me to go back  to school, then after I was done with school she would go back. And  then, we'd take the remainder of the trust fund and move to a cheaper  city to live where we would buy a house. "" *Narcissists are selfish.*

&#x200B;

"" Wife told me last week that she wants to be the one to go back to school  first, and that she can do the stay at home mom thing while she's doing  it and of course, that means she gets the new car while I'll get her  current car. She also said that it'd be a good time for us to have our  last baby, since she could stay home with him/her while in school after I  went back to work and it'd ""practically be maternity leave"" *Narcissists are delusional.*

&#x200B;

"" So instead of having an honest conversation about who should go to  school and how we'd handle the trust fund money, she made it about her,  and how *she* felt watching me while I  was pregnant and her agony of not being able to breastfeed her baby or  of knowing she could never be pregnant ..."" *That's a narcissist for ya.*"
1548,Jo_in_TN,"Oh, my.  I'm so sorry you are going through all of this.

It appears that you are emotionally and financially invested in your family to the point of **denying yourself** needed things.

Unfortunately, your wife is emotionally and financially invested only in herself to the point of **denying her family** needed things.

Trans or not, you would be a fool to let this person get one dollar from your trust fund.  I know that's harsh, but your spouse is now a member of the ""cult of trans"" and it will affect you in ways too numerous to list here.  

And until you get a legal separation, you will be responsible for any bills she accrues.

Take care."
1549,smashy-galore,"I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, your spouse sounds like a typical narcissist who is stealing your life and your energy. It's unfair to you, and you don't deserve so little self-care and so much of the domestic and emotional labor ‚Äì as well as this big debt burden! We've seen over and over that a trans spouse will drain away all the financial resources for their transition ‚Äì and then just keep taking. Any reasonable person would feel badly about doing this to you. Leave and don't let your spouse get any of your trust money if you can work that out. Learn about financial management, go to debtor's anonymous if you have to (it's actually very supportive and not as dogmatic as other 12-steps), but get out of the debt lifestyle for your own sanity. Put your windfall money into savings ‚Äì as much as you can. You'll find if you're not leaking money you can do a lot more with it and take care of yourself and your children and make all your own dreams come true. You need financial freedom. I would also recommend addressing your codependence in this relationship. This is not a judgement, I have similar issues and working on myself to find my own peace was the right thing because I can't control others. (Edit for child to children.)"
1550,SadSwoleMaiden,"Run. Good grief, I'm so sorry you're in this situation, but for the sake of your children and your own sanity, you have to.  This isn't a trans issue, this is an issue with your spouse being selfish and abusive and taking advantage.  Spouse absolutely ignoring your needs and those of your children while driving your family into debt and refusing to shoulder their share of the burden? Not OK no matter who they are.

The trans issue is just the crazy icing on a crappy cake - this person seems to be using it as the excuse for their appalling behaviour.

Very glad you've got a supportive brother.  Stick with him, get that lawyer and don't talk to sister about it.  Hate to say it, but if she knows what you are doing, she may sabotage and tell your spouse if she's trying to get you to stay together."

I‚Äôm sorry for being blunt but you‚Äôre right, love is not enough and it‚Äôs time to extricate yourself and your children before more terrible damage is done. 

I need to add this: if you‚Äôre feeling guilty about leaving him because of transitioning, remind yourself that you‚Äôre not leaving him for being trans, you‚Äôre leaving him for being a sociopath."

1560,you-sound-mad,"You seem like a genuine kind hearted person. Your spouse sounds very selfish and not grounded in reality. She has/had a loving wife that took care of her and respected her when most would‚Äôve left in your situation, yet she cannot look passed herself long enough to realize that there is two people in this marriage not just her. I‚Äôm a woman and it isn‚Äôt every aspect of my life. I don‚Äôt disregard others to make myself feel better as a woman. I don‚Äôt whine to other men and treat them different because I have periods and they don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt envy men for something they cannot control, so I‚Äôm not sure why she envies you for simply existing (being able to get pregnant and the sorts). Honestly it‚Äôs bullshit. Idk what it is about this theme that makes it okay for some trans women to completely revert back to children. In this political climate we have today, they are cradled by an entire movement like babies; so much so that they forget that they are adults and that their feelings and needs do not come first in every aspect of life. I‚Äôd expect a child to think/feel/act this way because children are to be dependent and protected by society and the adults around them. But I‚Äôll be damned if I sit here and hold a 30 year olds hand and allow them to act like my children. God bless you and get out while you can. Unless she can look beyond her damn self for 2 seconds out of the 10 years y‚Äôall have been together, I don‚Äôt see this being beneficial or salvageable for you. Trans people like this should just date each other. Can you imagine the narcissistic black hole the two of them would create in a small room? One upping each other‚Äôs tears and triggers. Good God."
1561,bibliopuff,"One part of your story that really bothers me is the breastfeeding and maternity leave thing. That is so far from normal in actual lesbian relationships. My girlfriend has talked about how she‚Äôd like to be the one to carry a baby for us someday, and I would never ever think to go through the cost and effort of causing myself to lactate unless she ends up having major difficulty with it herself. Not to mention the whole point of maternity leave is to allow a woman some time to physically and emotionally recover from the act of giving birth. It sounds like your spouse is just obsessed with acting out her idea of womanhood, as if it‚Äôs nothing more than a frilly costume and a performance."
1562,VanillaWaiver,"I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. It sounds so disheartening and so exhausting. I know the most important things are your and your children‚Äôs safety and well-being, and that probably means divorce. But I‚Äôm worried about his getting half your money, so I would actually say there‚Äôs no Hope here and file for divorce BEFORE your birthday. I would think that may protect your trust fund from your spouse getting half of it. They sound so selfish and self-absorbed. Definitely no sex and no unprotected sex and oh, so they‚Äôre on hormones but also still fertile? Hmm. Anyway protect yourself and your family and get away from this narcissist as soon as you can. They will still have visitation or even custody rights but you will not be chained to them and their bad mistakes. Half those credit card bills will probably be your responsibility, if they‚Äôre in both your names. So sorry your spouse has taken this selfish journey."
1563,Purl4luv,"You are absolutely right about everything that you've said! But you may not realize that you are in an abusive relationship and it's only going to get worse. And it will get even worse when you get your money. 

You have to keep your money away from your spouse who will spend it on themselves and leave you & the kids destitute. You also need to get out now! If you don't you'll continue to be abused by your spouse! You must leave for the health & safety of you and your children. Your spouse is showing dangerous mental illness!

1571,FruitTreesRule,"If you do divorce, I'd be very surprised is this dude demands full, or even part, custody. He can't bother to do any chores for himself so cleaning up after two kids would give him a huge kick in the balls. 

Plus it sounds like he can't handle child rearing in general since he pawns that off to you 100% of the time. 

People say ""leave him, divorce him"" and although I agree I do recognize that lighting a bomb on your marriage is going to be emotionally devastating, even if it's the right thing to do in the long run. Usually when people knee jerk into divorce with out a plan they are left vulnerable. 

I suggest coming up with a plan b over the next few months. Talk to a divorce lawyer to come up with a plan. Slowly disconnect yourself emotionally from your spouse. Read this sub. Document their behavior to reinforce why you want to leave. Educate yourself on the financial side of divorce, and staying married to a man who racks up debt. come up with a plan to financially protect yourself as much as possible. Find a confidant who will help you make this transition to being single again because it will be scary and painful at times. Again, read this sub because he and his friends will use the trans thing to leverage power over you, gaslight you, guilt trip you, etc. 

Good luck and post updates for support."

I have very little experience with transsexuals, but it's seems to me that when a person is transitioning, then that becomes the be all and end all to their existence. Everything centre's around them and their change, it consumes their mentality and opinion on almost everything.

Get out before you receive the money, as if you stay with this person, they will only be thinking about how they can get their hands on the money to spend on their new lifestyle, thus be taking the money away from your children and yourself."

Just a few tips, as I'm a single parent as well: buying a house is not worth it. My parents used to own one and the expenses like new central heating, .. can really break your neck when you don't have savings. Just renting something makes your income more planned. I've lived in cheap appartment blocks for most of my life and there are really good ones, very central in the city that have playgrounds in the garden and everything. You get used to it. If you can afford it, there are houses to rent as well. I also buy everything, from furniture to clothing thrifted or on flea markets. There are special flea markets for children's stuff, you should really look out for those! They usually have shoes as well. I was glad about that since good shoes are necessary for children and they can be really expensive. A library card is a good idea as well, my daughter just started reading. It is totally possible to raise children on your own, don't worry :) better times will come when you got rid of him"

1583,RaspberryInk,"\[edit\] I just read my post, and I'd just like to say from the start that I'm sorry you're going through this. It sounds really difficult, and I hope you have the support you need. The end of a marriage is rough, no matter the circumstances.

&#x200B;

To me it sounds like your SO is using (abusing) being trans and your love and accommodation for her to act like a spoiled, self-centered brat. This is probably mostly caused by deep, pervasive insecurity on her part, but it sounds like the insecurity is taking over as she tries way too hard to achieve a probably unachievable/unrealistic view of what it means to be ""female."" It sounds like there's some significant maturing that she needs to do, which probably needs a lot more therapy. I would expect there's a lifetime of work on her part, and depending on her own personality, it could even be unachievable. Real, deep change is always a long and difficult process.

More importantly, it's not your responsibility to solve her problems. Her internal emotional/psychological struggles are her own. It sounds like you've been supportive and tried, which IMO, is what a spouse should do. It's not a failing on your part if your SO has things that you can't resolve. Like you, I've always had a deep seated view that marriage is forever, but I had my marriage end due to my SO's mental illness. Like you, I struggled for a while with feeling like a failure for ""giving up."" I was unsure of myself and didn't know if I was making the right decision. It took years to work through it--no matter the circumstances, or how right the decision, ending a marriage is a tragic experience. Even if it's right, it sucks. Looking back a decade later, there was nothing I could do to help my ex. Staying was hurting us both. It was important to me to feel like I really tried and didn't just give up on my marriage, but it was ultimately the right decision to end it. You may not really know if you're making the right decision, but you have to care for yourself. If you really can't do it anymore, then trust yourself--you're doing the right thing."

1595,aladyfleeingzombies,"I probably do say sorry too much, and definitely for sure do it more after my wife transitioned. It was like living with a hormonal 12 year old for a bit there, and it was also really annoying because you can tell a hormonal 12 year old (like my mother told *me* and I fully plan on telling my daughter) that she's allowed to have emotions but not allowed to use those emotions as an excuse to treat those around her like dirt. You try to tell your trans wife that and you're apparently not being understanding of what she's going through. Which made me mad, but I ignored my anger and tried to be empathetic. 

All of what you said about breastfeeding is true and what we found on our research; wife did not like reading it at *all* and it and my ""lack of support for *her*"" (because, you know, I was 100% concerned about the baby's needs as well as the money) was a hot topic in therapy for too long. 

>Can't even be bothered to help you clean up and give you a chance to hang out with your children?

The kids are doing their own age appropriate chores too after dinner; and occasionally she'll give them a hand which actually isn't helpful because I want the kids learning how to do things and that it's part of them being apart of the household so everyone has chores. If I ask, she'll help me dry dishes or something, but I don't think I *should* have to ask you know? 

I looked at the ""mypartneristrans"" subreddit, and honestly it feels like there's a lot of very young people there, and/or those in the same place I was two years ago. I don't think they have any valid advice or would offer much support to me; it feels like it would be about my wife's needs and feelings if I did post there.

It feels dishonest, and like every evil ex wife stereotype, especially with how my home state treats trans people but given the state we live in I don't think courts here are going to look at the facts and put my kids and whats best for them first over my wife. 

The kids are all I care about. A little bit me, but honestly, 95% is them. Especially my daughter. She's not a doll for my wife to live vicariously though. 

I can't stop thinking about when my daughter is a teenager. What if she doesn't like wearing dresses like I did at that age? Or doesn't want long hair or like getting her nails painted? Will wife make her feel bad for any of that? Like my daughter is less of a girl? And I can't stop picturing my daughter telling me she got her first period, then my wife getting upset daughter didn't tell *her* first, and making our daughter feel a little...not quite guilty because wife won't ever have a period or get pregnant assuming wife lets us talk freely about it instead of hiding it. God, I can't even ask her to pick up some tampons on her way home because it upsets her. 

As I keep think about it, I'm realizing I'd feel awkward with my wife sitting there sharing in this moment, just like I would have if my dad had been sitting there with me and my mom when we talked about it.  Uggghhh.  

 I hate my job, especially after what they pulled after my daughter was born, and I think my spouse will buy me quitting to go out of state -especially if I promise or at least imply that I'm down with her college plans and will get another job asap after I return. Wife pays daycare for our daughter out of her paycheck so I'm sure she'll be happy to not have to pay that while we're out of state. Son will miss the last six/seven weeks of school but that's okay. 

God, this won't be easy. I need to talk to my brother and a lawyer in this state and home state. My sister in law is very pregnant with twins, I'm sure my brother will be okay lying and saying they need me to come help them out and for the kids to come too to keep my nephew company."

He is taking you for a ride, a fully paid all inclusive ride.

We talked about merging bank accounts here and there but have never really gotten around to it because it wasn't that important to either of us.

1644,ThisIsNotShakira,"Men do have some milk ducts, and some mammary tissue, and *theoretically* they can produce milk - either due to taking drugs that induce lactation, or because it is a symptom of breast cancer, etc. 

However, so little is even really known about the components of women‚Äôs breast milk beyond we know that it has benefits for babies immune systems and so on beyond the colostrum stage (another example of how medicine ignores women for most part), that it is just negligent in my opinion to feed a baby male breast milk with so much unknown about its quality and how it compares to women‚Äôs breast milk. Also, women need to produce a LOT of milk for their babies (and if they can‚Äôt, the baby is at risk of being undernourished if they don‚Äôt switch to formula); I would be surprised if men can do that given they do have a lot less milk ducts and mammary tissue. Can you imagine one of these selfish men, like OPs husband, feeding a baby every 2-3 hours for half an hour or more around the clock? Or dealing with a baby not latching or needing to take an hour each time to get the amount the baby needs then getting an hour before having to go again?

Oh yeah, and then there is the whole they would be passing the drugs they need to induce lactation to the babies. It is all about the men‚Äôs fee fees, and not about the best interests or health of the child. 

A woman who was ‚Äústarving‚Äù her baby of milk and nutrients because she could not produce enough milk would be vilified; she is also often vilified if she switches to formula because of the same. But a man who can squeeze out some droplets of milk of uncertain quality - possibly contaminated with drugs - is so brave and stunning!

Women who haven‚Äôt given birth at all or not recently can also breastfeed by inducing lactation, though it can be easier if they have prior experience. Women used to act as milk nurses to other women‚Äôs babies (either as the mothers would not or could not breastfeed, of they were dead from childbirth/died during the child‚Äôs infancy). Sometimes the milk nurses would have to leave their own babies behind or undernourished to do this, or have even lost their own babies, but sometimes they either had no children or had them long ago, and were able to stimulate lactation with suckling, a baby‚Äôs cry, etc. Pre-formula, this was often the only chance a baby with a dead mother, or mother who could not feed, had."

I am with you, I find it incredibly bizarre when men ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù or won‚Äôt do laundry or wash dishes or any other chore.

Even worse than a man who won‚Äôt do their laundry is one who will *only* launder the clothes they wear and not the household stuff or kids laundry, too. No. 

Also can‚Äôt imagine why any grown man should need a ‚Äúchore chart‚Äù but on advice forums where women are looking for advice with a male partner not doing work around the house that seems to always be the overwhelming advice.

Your partner is self-absorbed and manipulative, and taking advantage of you. You accepted the behavior previously because he was a man doing things in male-socialized ways, and that was OK with you for whatever reason (no judgement).   


You're questioning because he's ""a woman"" now. You understand and have a community among women and female culture, but you KNOW women don't actually act that way unless they have other influences driving and changing them. We're socialized into gender roles even before birth much of the time because our sex is factual.    It would be great if we didn't live in a human society where gender roles and expressions were decided based upon sex, but the fact is, it happens. 


Your husband didn't lose his past and experiences and outlook when he transitioned, he just changed his perception of himself and demanded everyone else did as well. You're struggling because he's a man who is pretending to be a woman based on his misconceptions and biases, and you're trying to accept his non-truth while still being real to yourself.

1713,galit_,"First off, not a lawyer/this is not legal advice. That being said, you need to see a lawyer immediately. If you don't have the money for a lawyer, speak with your brother. This is one of those cases where unfortunately you stand to lose a lot more than what a lawyer might cost to retain. Do not tell anyone except your lawyer and trusted (and I mean *trusted*) family members what you're planning. Money always makes people go a bit crazy, but it gets worse when people have known about the money long enough to make plans for it. With only 6 months until your inheritance vests, you need to get a move on, and fast. Get out to see the lawyer as soon as you can.

There's a lot going on here, so try to carve out a few minutes for yourself tomorrow when you're feeling calm/relaxed (or as calm/relaxed as you're going to be) and jot down absolutely everything you can think of--these added expenditures, your incoming inheritance, whose name the credit card debt is under/whose card was used to rack it up, the timeline of transitioning (has your wife undergone surgery, changed sex markers on official documentation, etc.), what deadlines are impending, etc.--and where you want to go next. Write it all down, then walk away. On Sunday, pick it back up and go over it. Don't look at it when you're angry, because anger can cause you to start fudging facts without noticing. Just keep to facts for the most part.

Your lawyer may or may not need all the details you've included in your post; however, it's always best to walk into a meeting with a lawyer with everything written down on paper so that if you feel rushed or intimidated or overwhelmed etc. you can just refer down to what you've already written. Lawyers *love* organized clients. Organized clients are easy clients. Even if there's an uphill battle ahead of you (and I cannot guess at what will happen next; your lawyer will know far more so listen to them), being an easy client with an uphill battle is much better and easier to deal with than being a difficult client with a slam dunk case.

That being said, you don't need to bow and scrape and run for Ms Congeniality. You just need to show the lawyer that you take the situation seriously. Listen, ask questions when you don't understand something, and make sure you and the lawyer are on the same page before you leave the meeting. Take notes if you need/want to (I always take notes if only to keep my own written record of important meetings, but the lawyer should be taking notes of some kind as well if you forget) but whatever happens, leave knowing what you talked about and what the next steps are or would be (should you retain that lawyer). If you don't understand something, *ask*. Even if it only ends up being a consultation, and you end up with a different lawyer, still try to soak up everything you can.

Ultimately, you don't have much time to shop around, but you do have time to trust your gut. If anything seems off, thank them for their time and move onto the next. Above all else, trust in yourself. Transitioning does not make someone suddenly lose the ability to save money. Transitioning does not make your wife the centre of the universe. You have sacrificed so much for this marriage already. Please don't feel guilty for having the courage and sense to say you won't sacrifice anything more."

I've never experienced this, so take it with a grain of salt (and also perhaps consider approaching r/personalfinance but also take their words with a few grains of salt--these *are* just strangers on the internet, after all) but I think credit card debt might be one of those things that gets split 50/50 in a divorce unless you can extensively prove via receipts and such that it's all your wife/husband's doing.

They're plotting on how to spend YOUR money, that could benefit your children in so many ways, on stupid shit that only benefits them. Would you accept this behavior if they weren't trans? If they've never taken care of you, your children or your home, do you really think a bunch of money will make them act more responsible and supportive? You deserve better OP.

She did agree pretty fast but that didn't stop her from talking about how it, and I (even indirectly), was invalidating to her. God, even now she's not putting the baby's needs first. I dress the kids in hardy play clothes so they can *play*, and that includes the youngest getting her brother's hand me downs. I'd rather my daughter be able to run around without having to worry about getting dirty and she's cute no matter what she's wearing. Wife does not agree. Wife wants daughter to be dressed up in cute clothing as much as possible, and will waste money buying pretty expensive stuff. Said stuff isn't conductive to playing, let alone playing in mud which is basically daughter's favorite thing to do. I'm pretty sure at one point my daughter has more clothes then I or my son did combined. If I try to talk to wife about it, I get a giggle and a ""I'm just making up for the childhood I never had!"" And if I push it, there's tears or she asks to be alone.  When I clean out daughter's dresser to donate too small stuff or things she won't wear, I always end up setting aside a good portion of the expensive stuff to consign regardless.

Your trust fund (which is YOURS not his, by the way) can either be used by you to make a better life for yourself and your kids, or it can be wasted and frittered away by your spouse to buy more girly crap and push his way into grabbing YOUR college education for himself (if he is mentally stable enough to actually get through the classes. I would also be wary of him blowing big bucks on tuition, then not putting in the work to pass the classes and graduate).

Since it's obvious your spouse isn't going to put the kids first and is likely going to waste your money, do whatever it takes legal-wise so that you get ALL your money. I'm glad your brother is willing to help with a loan for an attorney. That money is your ticket to improving yourself and your life and therefore improving your kids' lives. This money will also allow you to get away from your spouse, which will also improve your kids lives. It sounds like you are on track to make all this happen, but I just wanted to reinforce the message. Your instincts are excellent. Follow them and don't back down to your spouse.

1788,cheapsouvenir,"Three interesting points about the study at the NCBI link, which was co-authored by a trans activist:

1 - The father maxed at 227 grams per day, while most women produce around 500 grams per day by the time a baby's 5 days old. Some questions are therefore asked about claims that the pediatrician involved found the adopted baby adequately nourished for six weeks on nothing but the father's lactate.

2 - The man's lactate had not been assessed at the time the study was published so it's not known if it had the same mix of components as milk from new gestational mothers.

3 - The father's choice to ingest estrogen, progesterone, spironolacton, and domperidone had unknown effects on the baby. The FDA does not allow domperidone to be sold in the U.S. because it's caused serious heart problems, including fatal ones. The man in the study was able to obtain it because he lives in Canada where the drug remains on the market.

The Milk Junkies post concerns one case, not two. In it, the father, who also chose to pass domperidone and synthetic hormones to his baby through his lactate, reported that he was unable to produce more than a few droplets at the time of the birth, then found the baby couldn't latch on because his breast tissue and nipple couldn't reach the back of the baby's throat until the baby was older and stronger, and after that, nursed in tandem with his wife because neither of them was producing enough milk for the baby.

1818,discosappho,"I wish I had been a child of divorce. Even as an adult, I wish my mum would leave my dad. I begged her as a teenager, as did my brother, to take us away. It takes a lot of courage, which she didn‚Äôt have, but god it would have been better in the long run for both of our mental health states."
1819,heidischallenge,Not sure divorce works like that. Suing a big corporation is more likely to get that deal
1820,ieghw,"LOL. No. I'm an attorney. I want to get paid. 

But you can sit down and go over costs and decide how you want to proceed. Don't let an attorney pressure you into something, and get a good idea of how much the cost of representation will run. 

Most attorneys will take payment plans."
1821,peregrine_throw,"Oh, so that's her. She got published, I guess that explains why she'd have to scrub her blog :D

The comment on that yt link:

>""The person she talked about is either not even trans or she is misrepresenting the story (or prob both).""

Of course. ‚óî_‚óîÔªø It's ""I am what I say I am"" until it turns ugly and it's suddenly 'fake trans'.

Good for Thrace and OP for having the guts and resources to get out of their misery. Can you imagine the abuse other women who are dependent and cannot get out would have to put up with? Fuck, that's hell."

1823,waffleflavouredfloss,Some of you are no different than rabid conservatives and liberals. Learn to be accepting of people with varying opinions or no one will want to support your cause.
1824,lefterfield,"Buuut... I wanted to be sassy. Both you and the OP used the word ""cynical"" and the connection was obvious. I didn't call you a thought traitor, that's far more of a leap. And yeah, you can wonder... but it'd be more helpful to point out why the story seems suspect. Considering that I have heard similar stories of abusive relationships between plain ol' boring men and their wives, I don't know what about this makes you suspicious."
1825,consider-thecoconut,"As I said, IN OTHER COMMENTS.

And you conveniently left out all the other parts of the OP that stated their partner did next to nothing before the transition, and now does even less because the more traditionally masculine roles ""trigger them""


""Despite her eagerly embracing the ""momma bear"" attitude since practically the first moment she told me she was trans, our child care and household chore duties have barely changed at all before and after transition. She still goes to the gym straight after work while I pick up the kids and go home to make dinner. Except now she's got a really cute gym bag and exercise outfits and sends me a cute selfie or two of herself while she's there.

She still gets home, eats dinner with us, then hangs out in the kitchen with me and the kids while I do the dishes and clean up. She tells me about her day. I like this part honestly, but I wish she would¬†help¬†because it would get done a lot faster if both of us were doing it.

She won't mow the lawn or do the outside chores any more -it gives her mental distress to do the household activities she did before she transitioned. So now I do all those in addition to most of the inside chores.""

Then OP put the comment you pasted where they talk about how they're still doing their partners laundry, as they always have,as an example of how they're still expecting her to do everything as it was before.

Also, OPs partner is technically a man regardless of whatever fantasies they have. I appropriately gendered their pre transition behavior, and was gender neutral discussing the rest which is more than what most people here to do so you're really arguing with the wrong person dude."
1826,st_quiteria,Undoubtedly.

She doesn't ""that's weird"" me, but anything I say she almost always just writes me off somehow in a way that makes me feel like she can't wait for me to stop talking to her. I thought I was imagining it over and over but I think I'm not. 

She didn't used to be like this; she used to care what I had to say and reacted like it. Thank you for that subreddit, I'm definitely going to be reading a lot there."
1829,Amareldys,This is a trust though. The whole point of a trust is to protect the money from situations like this. She needs to talk to the trustee and ask him or her to play hardball.
1830,goodtimeghoul,this^^ female childhood/puberty/adolescence is bad enough without someone actively enforcing harmful stereotypes with no regard to the child‚Äôs mental health
1831,Kang2143,"Right. Normally i advocate for letting equal parts in raising a child in divorce (courts mostly give custody to mothers) but in this instakce absolutely this person doesnt need to be the primary caregivers. And honestly, if beong trans is a fetish (which i personally believe so), OPs husband is actively involving children in this by bringing their trans friends to the hoyse to babysit."

Even the most gungho activist should be lucid enough to admit that trans people can be shitty just like anyone else, but here we are LOL."
1836,peregrine_throw,"No worries, that came across clear. It just reminded me of that JustNoMIL post where everyone was telling the woman it didn't matter if her abusive MIL was a TIM. It's like, wot, dude can easily overpower her if he upped his abuse. There are situations when being a TIM makes a lot of difference."

1839,RunAMuckGirl,"You are most welcome. I hope you continue to find it helpful, partly because it will help make it clear that the trans issue is only the mask a narcissist is wearing, and partly to help you know the support you got here was not just a biased point of view. It will also arm you with clear thoughts as you free yourself from the abuse you are suffering. 

When you first meet a narcissist they approach their target with ""love bombing"" to create join up. They also mirror all the things you love and care about to help the bonding cement. Then they start the ""negging."" *(subtle negative comments to break down your self esteem so you will tolerate their abuse)* It may appear he was not always like this, but this doesn't develop as a personality disorder later in life. It's been there since early childhood. There can be things that cause it to be more intense as apposed to other times, like life's demands, but it's been there, hiding. They love to hook in sensitive, ethical people. People who will think long and deep before doing something like say... file for divorce. :p 

Feel free to private message me or post here or that other sub again. It's ok to get a lot of support. üòä ‚ô°üåπ‚ô°

1841,consider-thecoconut,"I agree I think for some ppl its definitely a fetish. What's concerning to me in that end is that this person wants to wear the little girls clothes and gets mad when she dresses normal or plays outside ?? And wanted to bullshit breastfeed? And wants a baby just to play some BS motherhood fantasy instead of trying to connect with the children they already have??? 

Then there's also a huge correlation between sexual abuse in childhood and trans, and for men we see that a lot of those who were abused tend to do some abusing later on. So I'd be concerned with this person just bringing a bunch of random trans ppl to the house. Who knows what could happen. 

And since the lines of appropiateness is already very blurred with OPs partner and the children, they could easily do something that's considered inappropriate without even realizing it cause their sense of it is so warped."

You were exactly right to speak up for yourself. And you didn't hurt anyone with your costume. You simply ran afoul of a spiritually and psychically small man who sought to control you and everyone around him. They allowed you to become the scapegoat for this guy - that's the real outrage.

Speak to a human rights lawyer (ACLU in the USA or the HRC in Canada) about being asked to leave a work party because you were wearing a cross-sex costume when there were two men there also in cross-sex costumes. Don't mention the trans woman. Mention HR only. Let HR argue their reasons.

The opportunity to do that in the heat of the moment has passed, but you might still try to get HR to clarify in writing what exactly you did wrong and what exactly their ""logic"" was in asking you to leave. Don't even bring the powertripping misogynistic TIM into this discussion. Make it clear that you don't understand what *HR* wants from you and you need clarification of it. If they blow it off and say you didn't have to leave (they were already trying to walk it back the night of), you still should try to make them put their reasoning for the request for your ""voluntary"" exit in writing.

TIMs are misogynistic powertrippers, so there's really no use in trying to fight this guy, especially since anyone with any power in the company will take his side. This issue is about HR discriminating against you on behalf of a misogynist coworker. The legal responsibility falls on HR, which means it's up to them to tell the TIM to pound sand. Your job, if you choose to accept it, is to make them fulfill their responsibility to you.

Also, don't bring up lawyers or lawsuits if you can help it. Try to get them to write this down so you can use it as evidence later if necessary. They won't do this if they think you're going to sue them."

You were wearing something that women worked hard for to get the right to wear. By saying that you wearing that makes a transwo(man) uncomfortable and asking you to leave is reinforcing sex stereotypes and is absolute bullshit.

Interesting how the MAN afforded that courtesy to the MEN, but did not consider that maybe you had trans feelings but weren't ready to come out, and it's not her place to tell you what to wear.

Of course, this has everything to do with the fact that he knows if he complained to the men, they'd tell him to fuck off and might even laugh at him... but he feels that he has power over a woman, that his complaints might succeed with her, and that he won't face pushback for going after her.

> There's another party a friend is having tonight, but I don't know if I even want to go because I don't want to upset trans people.

Using the teeny percentage of abnormal gendered people as justification to make ridiculous claims about gender and sex is not a valid argument and many of the scientists are pushing their own agenda instead of abject truth.

As far as race goes, I doubt it had anything to do with this guy's motivations, although I can't say with certainty. The bullying of natal (biological) women is very, *very* common with ""transwomen"". It's happened to you. It's happened to me. And I've read way too many accounts from others who have been bullied and shut down because the only feelings which matter are the transwomen's. I'm sorry this happened to you. It's unfortunately much too common and it's way worse than just things like this. Reddit is infamous for shutting people down if they're ""on the wrong side"". (Although it isn't wrong at all). A lot of them, or their sympathizers, have taken over as mods on subs and you can get banned for saying totally innocent things. Or correct things. Or for just having an opinion. The bullying is pretty bad and really bad in real life. If you read around some, you'll see what I mean. There are sooooo many accounts of things that are changing or have been changed which hurt all natal women very badly. Definitely take the legal advice which has already been posted here. It's very good advice."

1924,earthgarden,"I am so glad you're seeing a lawyer. Your HR person was WRONG. Sarah was WRONG. This transwoman can feel whatever, but it is wrong to take those feelings and oppress another person.

1928,McBurgerHam,What have we become as society? Your coworker is mentality ill. This is all about attention. Tine to plan a nuclear revenge. Don't accept this bs.
1929,Alicyclic_Couple,I bet he is a ‚Äútransbian‚Äù too. They‚Äôre the incels that get triggered bc no one likes them in GIRL MODE either and make the real lgbt community look like shit.
1930,FemmeRevolutionnaire,"I see on a pretty consistent basis that transwomen have a hell of a lot more privileges than ‚Äúcis female‚Äù women (a redundant phrase).  

I don‚Äôt mean privilege in just the sociological definition (which only means someone does not experience discrimination on a particular axis), but also in the sense that they get an unusual amount of special treatment. They are rarely expected to compromise, acquiesce, or face repercussions for inappropriate behavior. Your story is an all too common example, but there are a lot of egregious ones. 

Even other trans activists have said that Halloween is an opportunity for closeted people to safely experiment with their gender identity in public, so it‚Äôs best not to make assumptions about the intentions of cross dressers. How can they be sure you weren‚Äôt trying to explore being a trans man? That doesn‚Äôt mean I personally agree that it‚Äôs transphobic to cross dress for any other reason, but it‚Äôs pretty hypocritical of a trans person to police anyone else‚Äôs gender nonconformity. 

Anyway. Your coworker was 100% out of line. Their feelings are their responsibility alone, not yours or anyone else‚Äôs. You did nothing wrong, they were obligated to deal with their own discomfort without taking it out on you. If they couldn‚Äôt handle it like an adult, they should have left. 

It‚Äôs not the fault of cis women if a transwoman can‚Äôt pass, and it‚Äôs not our job to make sacrifices because they feel insecure about it. You don‚Äôt owe them anything more than the same basic courtesy you‚Äôd give to any other person. 

This applies to any well-adjusted adult in a professional setting, trans or not. Imagine going to HR and saying you want a co-worker to leave a Halloween party because she‚Äôs too attractive and it makes you feel insecure about your looks, or because she was talking about her recent engagement and it made you feel bad because you‚Äôre single. That‚Äôs how delusional and self-centered this person‚Äôs behavior sounds. It‚Äôs just that as a society we‚Äôre all so afraid of the extreme backlash that comes with alleged ‚Äútransphobia‚Äù that we‚Äôre conditioned to indulge their victim complex and constant need for attention."
1931,flabinella,"Yes it's a very weird world we are living in. And it's getting weirder every day.

Fact 2019: only in very few particular situations people are being expected to foresee any hurt their totally normal actions would cause and they are expected to tweak their behavior.

On the other hand, there are situations where it's totally okay to say or ask things that actually might cause hurt to people but all everyone says is: well get over it.

I will tell you some examples I experienced.

It's totally okay to ask a woman why she doesn't have children. Not only is this a totally personal issue, you might actually hurt someone who is infertile.

It's totally okay to make certain comments about women's bodies. You might never mention her race or the fact that she's overweight. But go ahead and ask her what her shoe size is if she's tall. And if she's slim go ahead and tell her that she should eat something. All perfectly accepted and it happens on a regular basis for me.

so go ahead and invade a woman's privacy, comment on her body and life choices, but don't dare to have a funny costume at an event!"
1932,BlankeneseHamburg,"This is eye opening and thank you for sharing. I am new to this too. Some corrected me in this community saying that cis is not an ok term. Straight people shouldn‚Äôt be a labeled forced to be used because it‚Äôs a term trans pple came up with. They get to self define, we should to. Not be labeled by another group. It‚Äôs hypocritical.

But people don‚Äòt observe what sex you are at a glance and then discriminate against you accordingly, thinking that they do is really terve rhetoric. Sarah should examine her cissexist biases"

Yep, that's exactly where you go from here. That's the only place you can go from here. How freaking dare ""Sarah"" treat you so dismissively. You were fine, and your costume was fine, and you did nothing ""transphobic"" whatsoever. ""Sarah"" was the overly sensitive bigot and needs to put some big boy panties on before going to any more parties."
1939,kristiansands,"Let's remember that ""Sarah"" and her crocodile tears is an adult human male with so much privileges he pushed you out because your costume was probably better than his. 

He's a liar, and a racist that's why he did this little spectacle to you. You are exactly right to question Sarah's own attitude towards your skin color since transgenders are often not the last being huge racists."

This trans identified male (please , never call them women, they will never be women) deliberately picked on you, a black women, to have you removed. My good guess it was his chance to malign you and have you removed so that he is can revel in his fake victim-hood. He used you and treated you terribly. He's a narcissist and a woman hater. I commend you for going to a lawyer. Good luck sister."

It‚Äôs not only white supremacy, it is male entitlement, which trans women still have because they were socialized as men.

&#x200B;

The fact that you are black makes it more infuriating, because you don't get to choose your skin color while this person is actively choosing to marginalized themselves, play the victim role on top of it and make sure you know that \*her\* rights supersede yours."

It's like with periods, they love using the topic to talk about their own ""oppression"" but when it comes to actually supporting women (i.e respecting how difficult actual periods can be, sexism crossing over with racism) they don't say a single god damn thing. Good luck with the case."

If a woman wears pants or a long sleeve shirt, it reminds TIM of how if xhe wore the same thing, xhe would be perceived as a man.

When did you first notice Sarah was present/when did he arrive? What time was it and what were you doing when Sarah and 'HR' pulled you aside to talk about your costume?

All the details of this - what was the tone of 'it would mean a lot if you just left for the night?' Did you feel that some negative consequence (other than Sarah's feelings being hurt) would happen to you if you chose to stay? When you said your goodbyes and left, what did you say? Did any of your co-workers know why you were leaving? If they didn't, did they ask why you were leaving early? What did you say? Where was Sarah and ""HR"" while you were saying these goodbyes? What time did you leave? Ask your friends/co-workers who stayed at the party - when did the party end? What time did Sarah leave? How did she seem (mood, etc.) after you left? What time did the men dressed as women leave? **This part is important -** were any work projects, upcoming work social events, or other important work-related conversations you would have been part of had you been able to stay talked about at the party after you left? (This is where damages start applying.)

*Why* did you cry on the way home? Was it just because you had been looking forward to the party, was it because it felt unfair, was it because you hadn't meant to hurt anyone's feelings, was it because you didn't feel you got to state your side of things, was it because the cross-dressing men could stay, was it because you felt accused of transphobia or being disrespectful/hurtful when that wasn't the case, was it because you were worried about the consequences with HR going forward, or some combination of these (or other) things? 

Write down everything you remember, times, people, transport modes, everything, and if you have co-operative coworkers, let them help. 

Your next step should be to write a simple email to HR. *You need to write a simple wording of events that is basically impossible for them to deny.* Leave out details they could say didn't happen or are exaggerations - just the simple truth. 

This is an example, but it might not be right for you (include *only* facts they cannot deny or 'spin,' even better if you can name witnesses who heard the conversation or saw you forced to leave.)

'I am writing re: the events of the evening of (party date), when \[HR person\] told me it was best for me to leave the company party because my costume was upsetting to another co-worker, Sarah, because I was a 'cis woman' dressed as a male character. This happened even after I explained that my costume was simply a favourite character of mine, that I did not intend to hurt anyone's feelings, and after I pointed out that two men at the party were dressed as female characters. Those men were *not* asked to leave. This incident was distressing to me, and I would like to put it on the record. I have testimony from two other co-workers who \[heard the discussion where I was asked to leave, saw me leaving the party in tears, whatever is true.\] If you do not agree with my accounting of this event, I would appreciate a detailed reply indicating exactly where you feel my recollection, and the recollection of my co-workers, is not accurate.""

This will put them on notice that you're thinking lawsuit, so be careful, but make it airtight and basically impossible for them to deny. It should only be a few sentences long (your detailed write-up of the night may be pages long - keep that for *your* lawyer, don't show it to HR.)

Don't start looking for a lawyer until you have written out every detail you remember, quietly enquired if any co-workers can vouch for any of what you're saying occurred (I mean *any* of it - even if someone just remembers you left suddenly and unexpectedly, that's good, ask them to write down what they remember.) Then once you have your written statement, any corroborating statements, and a response from HR to your undeniable facts, go find that lawyer and *please* crucify your employer, because what happened to you is not okay. (I might think differently if the men in 'cross-dress' were also asked to leave, but they weren't? That's some bullshit right there.)"
2026,marilynspolitics,ACLU and HRC are both very pro-trans. Try find representation that will treat you fairly.
2027,TAgurl,"Yes, yes, yes! Legal advice pronto!

My mind raged upon reading this account. I immediately started rationalising the situation with regards to HR work policies for clothing etc. I know it‚Äôs confronting to be put on the spot in this scenario, but unless HR can show definitive documentation that clearly outlines where OP had contravened any said policy, it was completely unacceptable to suggest, even in an ‚Äòunofficial‚Äô capacity (and regardless of how oh, so politely it was couched) that she leave the party.

In this instance OP, YOU were clearly singled out and discriminated against. 

Be clear when recounting the reason they gave you for suggesting you leave. What language did they use and how did they use it? Was the reasoning they gave sound, with regards to your behaviour? The obvious answer is no. 

They kicked you out just to appease someone else‚Äôs sensibilities - someone you had zero direct contact with that night. Nobody else found your costume offensive up to that point, so don‚Äôt let them pull that card on you either. 

Remember OP to also highlight that you immediately tried to calmly resolve this issue and brought to their attention the blatant discrimination between your being asked to leave, and the verbal response you were given for why the cross-dressing men didn‚Äôt have to.

Was it even acceptable for a representative of HR to approach you in this casual manner? What‚Äôs the policy for this? It was essentially an ambush, for which you had zero time to prepare for, let alone accept. 

Good luck!"
2028,TrueIsntSafe,"Seconding the stay away from the ACLU opinion. They have fully drunk the trans Kool-Aid.

Step 1 is to document everything. OP should start a folder in her home. For each incident, jot down names, dates, places, witnesses, people she talked to after the fact, and copies of any key documents. Now that the TIM has had a taste of exercising shame and ostracism powers over a female coworker and HR has backed him up on it, the crybullying is going to ramp up. 

It won't necessarily be aimed at OP again, and probably not against 67-year-old Marie. But woe to McKenzie who sits next to the TIM and has the temerity to be pregnant in his presence, or Molly who needs extra accommodation for her endometriosis, or Megan who dares tell her work besties about her PCOS or TTC struggles.

Step 2 is for OP to pull out her employee handbook. Familiarize herself with company policy on reporting a hostile work environment incident. Even though the party wasn't typical 9-5 work, it's still corporate enough.

Step 3 is to make some tough choices about whether and how to actually report. 

If OP is going for a lawyer, she should look for a local plaintiff's employment discrimination lawyer. If she's in the US, it may be a little early to find a lawyer who will take the case on a no-money-up-front contingent fee, but it might be worth her time to seek an initial consultation on the hostile work environment. Just depends on how hungry the local sharks are.

If OP can't find a lawyer at this early phase - or she just doesn't want to - she needs to decide whether she wants to risk an internal corporate complaint. On the one hand, doing this promptly and by the book makes it harder for them to undermine her timing and motives if it ever does get to litigation. On the other, only OP has a sense of what kind of retaliation is likely to blowback on her for being 'difficult'.

In any event, OP should probably leave the GC/QT/TRA politics out of it. Unless her lawyer tells her otherwise, continue to play along with the TIM's pronouns, etc. For now, this is just about a double standard for male and female staff, and being singled out as 'inappropriate' with inadequate advance warning or justification."

2141,4eyedPurplePPLeater,"Cis is supposed to mean your gender identity matches your body/ sex. But going by their own doctrine, assuming a person's gender identity is a bad thing. Therefore, assuming you're cis & have cis privilege, goes against gender ideology.... yet it happens all the time because rampant hypocrisy thrives in this movement.      

Gender pertains to roles, stereotypes, & expectations, that are nothing but a social construct, enforced by a patriarchal society. Gender has been a powerful tool used to oppress women -- by claiming we are ""cis"", they are claiming we are not only walking stereotypes, but that we willingly identify with our oppression... not very progressive is it?       

That's why gender identity is harmful. For it to exist, they expect a portion of people to fit into this narrow definition of what a man or woman is. We know no one does, so going by gender logic, everyone should technically be ""non binary"" or ""trans"", because no one is a walking stereotype.      

If everyone could qualify as having a different ""gender identity"" from their sex, then it shows why the whole concept is flawed. They choose to believe in these regressive sexist stereotypes, & tell people their body must be wrong, rather than seeing the problem is with having that mentality in the first place.

EXACTLY!

The logical solution would be to send the TiM home. If he's so delicate that something as simple as a woman dressing up as a male Batman villain causes him to run screaming to HR and cry ""DYSPHORIA!!"", than he's clearly too sensitive for Halloween.

&#x200B;

Also, as others have pointed out, where does this end? If this TiM can command HR to send a woman home for wearing a tuxedo to a party (without the makeup, most TwoFace costumes are just normal tuxedos), can he also send one home during a normal workday because she wore a ""masculine"" pantsuit to the office and it triggered him? What if a very butch woman comes to work there and seeing her go about her day in masculine clothes, no makeup, and short hair causes him to have a breakdown? Will HR then be compelled to tell the butch woman she's required to wear skirts and makeup to the office because it would make the trans person less sad? It's INSANE to allow one person to have this much power over their co-workers. 

&#x200B;

I can't help feeling just a little sorry for the HR rep in this story. I imagine HR was in a bind because, in this climate, if you say ""no"" to a transgender person (especially a TiM) or imply that they might be over reacting to something silly (like a goddam Halloween costume) you'll likely be in for a PR nightmare that could destroy your business.

Then email your story to yourself (and a trusted friend, or your mom or sister or whatever) so it's dated and timed. Then print it out, seal it in an envelope, mail it to yourself, and after you receive it in the mail keep it sealed - the postmark is your proof of when you wrote it (this is a common thing in copyright cases, it works just as well for 'witness testimony') You can unseal it in court or arbitration if it comes to that. 

If you know what happened, you can describe the timeline, and especially if you have any witnesses (if they heard the 'you should leave' conversation, amazing, but even if they just noticed you leaving suddenly and unexpectedly and remember the cross-dressing men staying on, that's damn good)  you are in a strong position and HR should be quaking in their boots... details, every little detail. We lawyers will jump on a case with contemporary accounts of what happened in detail... because we can win those, more often than not. I understand you're hurt and upset but write it all down, find any witnesses who can corroborate any part of what you're alleging, focus on getting the story down first before you start worrying about lawyers and all that... *the story is the case*.

Even if the case is successful, all an employer needs to do is axe any ""woman"" dress codes & make a policy,  (for ex) that all employees need to wear neutral colored pants & a button up.

Basically, your body says 'I'm exhausted from the internal bullshit and can't deal with any external nonsense'. You literally, physically can't deal with crap anymore. I wish it felt better physically, but it's really kind of freeing.

(it‚Äôs illegal to record without permission in differing jurisdictions). Generally, the burden of proof will always fall on to you if there is no other evidence.

Doing so, I‚Äôve had decisions made against me/my actions from years past overturned or abolished, and this includes fines or supposed multiple debts (which were proved to be incorrect). I could do this only because I keep detailed records. 

This may seem extreme, but how many times for instance, have people been verbally told something by a utility company only to receive a bill where you‚Äôve been charged for something outside of what you thought were agreed terms. If you contact them and challenge them on this, they typically claim ignorance or error, so bad luck for you.

2213,muffinsrising,"Wow this was a ride. When I was searching for this article I came across [a similar one posted to reddit](http://np.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/6luvs1/man_who_identifies_as_6year_old_dominates/) about a man dominating a kids crossfit class. One of the comments referred to the article saying that the man 'didn't identify' as someone who was taking growth hormones, and mentioned that this should be a standard response to a PED's accusation.

&#x200B;

I [googled PED](https://www.floelite.com/articles/6225210-emily-abbott-fails-ped-test-is-barred-from-crossfit-games) because I didn't know what it stood for: Performance-Enhancing Drug test. That article lists women who have been sanctioned for failing the test. 2nd on the list is a woman banned for using ""clomiphene - selective estrogen receptor modulator"".

&#x200B;

[Clomiphene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomifene) is primarily prescribed to treat female infertility by stimulating ovulation (for example, women with PCOS). It stimulates GnRH release, which upregulates sex hormone production and inhibits receptors for estrogen in the brain that would turn 'off' the signal. As a result, the hypothalamus perceives the body to have low estrogen, and upregulates gonadotropin (FSH and LH) production. These stimulate the ovaries to produce more estrogen. As ovary follicles develop they in turn produce more estrogen. It works for infertility because high estrogen is needed at that phase of the cycle to get a follicle to rupture for ovulation.

&#x200B;

Clomiphene is banned by the [World Anti-Doping Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_drugs_banned_by_WADA). So females can't use drugs to increase their estrogen production as a treatment for PCOS and infertility, but TiMs can pop all the estrogen that pleases them without regulation to treat their genderfeels. Women aren't allowed to mess with their natural estrogen hormone levels, not even when they have a serious medical condition... so much for ""transwomen are women""."

2252,WotNoKetchup,"It's great how trans get to police what a dysphoria is and isn't?

In a previous study, it was suggested that the experience of blood donation was also gendered, that for male donors it was ‚Äòjust a product‚Äô while for women blood donation formed a relationship with the recipient (Waldby et al. 2004).

 However, in the plasma products industry, male plasma has historically been more highly sought after and valued because it is perceived as a less ‚Äòrisky‚Äô product than plasma from women. 

Two examples demonstrate how gender operates as an organising principle in blood and plasma processing. 

First, in the UK since 2003, a policy of ‚Äòmale donor preference‚Äô has been adopted meaning that all women's plasma obtained through blood donation is usually discarded (i.e. unless there is a shortage of male plasma) because it is associated with a potentially higher incidence of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) attributed to high levels of antibodies following pregnancy. 

The reproductive potential of women's bodies impacts on how they are understood as blood and plasma donors: women are identified as potentially being or having been pregnant at the point of donation and thus at risk of adversely affecting the recipients of their donated plasma. Women are thus constructed as more risky bodies and the maternal body as representing a threat to blood and plasma product safety"

I don't think XYs or even intersex people should be competing against XX, but if you're going to use testerone even 5 is way too high. If a woman (XX) was over 2.5 she would likely be under the care of a doctor because it be a sign of other health issues.

2312,Spirited-Wrongdoer,"The right's reasons for resistance against TRA's is very different from radical feminism's reasons for resistance against TRA's. Their central ideology is not centered around protecting women, women's bodily autonomy, and women's safety. They might shroud their hatred as concern for women, but they've shown with their policies and actions that their stances are rooted in hatred and ignorance.

Radical feminism denounces TRA ideology not because we are afraid of change or because we are inherently hateful. We resist TRA ideology because it functions as an extension of misogyny. Talk about misogyny to a right leaning person, and they'll roll their eyes at you. They're not our allies just because they post negative content about transgenderism."
2313,Nickels4Tickles,But it isn't a bipartisan issue in US politics.

I'm sure that's true, but unfortunately there are enough mediocre failed male athletes who suddenly find meaning in beating down women that without regulation they won't be kept away.

2333,Spirited-Wrongdoer,"Like the other person on this thread said, I guess I'm confused with your use of the term bipartisan issue. It's important to make sure that we are careful who we are aligning ourselves with when we champion our causes.

I'm saying labeling someone conservative does have a place in this issue because if they are conservative, I won't be able to appeal to them from a GC perspective when I'm talking about issues relating to transgenderism.

It matters to me when someone is conservative. It matters to me in making sure that in my feminism I am not blind to the issues related to race, immigration, war and poverty."
2334,Julzlex28,"A bipartisan issue is generally used to talk about how the Senate and House of Reps vote along party lines, not opinions of the general population. So as someone said this isn't a bipartisan issue. Literally every leftist/ liberal/ Democrat politician has come out in support of this issue. It is deep in both mainstream and not so mainstream leftist circles. In fact the left has made this about liberal and conservatives by slamming any liberal who criticizes trans ideology as being in bed with the right. They have absolutely surrended  mainstream political criticism of trans ideology to homophobic, racist, classist conservatives. So YOU as a liberal may be critical of trans ideology, but that is not reflected in leftist political circles with power, or is it reflected in their policy making. And they will have egg on their face when it backfires and seems like conservatives are on the right side of history - even if it is for the wrong reasons."

No woman should trust a party that chases after woke points at the expense of female prisoners who will be raped by mentally ill men."
2338,Julzlex28,"But this is ""those damn liberals."" It is unfortunate that right-wingers are coming over here, but we cannot pretend that trans policy isn't being passed almost exclusively by liberals in the United States. It is the Democrats, not the Republicans, utterly pandering to and accepting trans ideology. Just look at Elizabeth Warren.

Perhaps the mods, who do a good job, can be one the look out for right-wingers. But I believe they already are. I am not going to not hold liberals accountable for their utter betrayal of women just because some lost right-wingers wonder over here. No matter how you talk about politics your going to attract people you don't like.

2339,Manaxium,"There are so many depraved and ill people in the world. Makes it seem a given that there will be abuse if males are allowed to compete with women. Oftentimes the kind of people to be so dedicated to Olympic sports are people who desire their moment in the spotlight and their legacies. Seems obvious that some, especially with exacerbating comorbidities, would see value in sacrificing being male if it means they will be noticed both for their superior fitness ‚Äúas a woman‚Äù and be made a topic due to being a trans woman.

The stakes are high. If it‚Äôs allowed to continue I feel it is inevitable that someone is going to take it too far in competitive sport and a woman is going to end up dead.

It is **so** irresponsible to put a fully grown man and woman in a ring together and say ‚Äúdo your worst‚Äù. The power disparity, despite the attempts to discredit the truth about how HRT affects athletes, is enormous.

One way or another, it‚Äôs going to be noticed and people are going to react. The backlash is looming."

I loathe MRA and TRA and ""choice feminism"" and anyone who is deluded enough to think prostitution is a choice for the prostituted. Yet, no on on the right agrees with me on anything else...

2362,gendernormie,"Now that would be an effective litmus test. I would love it if the trans community in general just stopped their fetishistic obsession with Asian bodies and cultures, and anime is *always* the gateway. At this point, you can automatically tell someone is a 30-something man with a prepubescent anime girl avatar before even looking at their profile, just by the way they talk. 

I'll never forget looking through Sailor Moon DVDs when I was 12 (and looked even younger), and this grown man with a purse came over and started talking to me in a silly girly voice about the characters. I had enough experience with creeps by then to immediately go find my friend's mom, but many similar encounters both online and in person since then just made me sick of the whole anime scene even before I realized how misogynistic most of it is."

Personally I haven't heard of any form of therapy other than either psychotherapy (which I'm sure won't be 100% effective on someone who is dedicated to get hormones) or hormone therapy (which does more harm than good for the patient if the patient didn't experience gender dysphoria before starting it). I heard of therapy with antidepressants + neuroleptics, but it's also harmful just because of the nature of these drugs (not sure what it does in relation to dysphoria symptoms, haven't looked into it much) + I don't hear about it much, maybe it's only used in some countries."

I find some of the content harmful like loli, yaoi etc, but it‚Äôs  the pathological representation of performative gender that I find most harmful.  Mostly because performative masculinity tells one that they must be m-to-female or gay to enjoy the performative femininity.

They just see themselves not fitting this (frankly ridiculous) stereotypes of western masculinity combined with (also ridiculous) eastern stereotypes if femininity and it leads potentially to them wanting to mutilate themselves."

Since being trans is highly correlated with issues like autism and cluster b personality disorders, esp narcissism, maybe an option is to somehow treat it similarly to how those conditions are managed?

We seek out things that help us make sense of the world and especially nowadays it's very easy to find other like minded individuals.  Problem is when we surround ourselves with like minded others it tends to make a feed back loop (echo chamber) and we start to reinforce our ideas and those ideas become facts.

I've been watching anime since I was 7 and I'm now 41 and yes as a teen I wasn't sure how I fit in the world and I even though that I might be gay.

No one should be watching loli anyways or anything similar. Yaoi, yuri are meh but can cause ""pathological"" mishaps in one form or another.

Anything viewed can cause someone with mental issues to have some kind of mental break, hell there are furry fgs running around because they think they are animals.

It was Contrapoints who got the masses to widely accept the concept, though in the context of ‚Äústraight‚Äù men loving ‚Äúgirldick‚Äù (the Trojan horse being that it will ultimately be/is already forced on lesbians...but we make the concept palatable in the first place by talking about the ‚Äústraight‚Äù [in reality closeted bi/gay] men who seek it of their own free will.)

Contrapoints got the leftish masses to accept the concept by being much cleverer about how he introduced it compared to this trans philosopher. I have to admit, I‚Äôm still shocked at how readily the ‚Äúmouthfeel‚Äù ‚Äúfeminine penis‚Äù bullshit was accepted though.

Edit: I stand corrected. I read this guy‚Äôs article before I watched the contra video, (back when I had more patience to listen to everything the TRAs said so I could engage productively with them...ha), but this guy actually references contra, so looks like contra was first after all."

2523,Palgary,"I studied Japanese in college because I really like Japanese Music and Sci-Fi anime.  I also really liked that they had literature (manga) aimed specifically at women.  Japanese people are very stoic, so their media and music tends to be melodramatic/full of emotion.  I come from a stoic background and we're the same way - music is really melodramatic and a socially appropriate way to release emotions.  However, I got over wanting to ever visit or live there because Japan is so hugely sexist and racist.  Women only have the right to vote because Americans wrote it into the constitution after WWII.  

To be fair - I think we used to only get the best, more analytical/sci fi Anime, and now we get all the garbage too.

*Aggretsuko* is a pretty good Anime about what it's like to be a young woman in Japan today, navigating independence and a career vs getting married with Sanrio-like characters.  The main character lets off steam by going to Karaoke and singing death metal."

""Fan service"" in that context obviously meant the sexualized stuff. Yeah, lots of media has sexy scenes and such, but anime again and again has trash tropes around it.

2539,less_racist_account,"Female anime characters are designed specifically to either be an overtly sexualized characterization of an adult woman or an overtly infantilized child with the features of a toddler. The avatars TIM's have are either one of these, the way they feel most comfortable being perceived and feel is closest to their identity is either as a child or a mockery of being a woman. Picking a young looking anime avatar is no better than the other choice because of a lack of ""sexualized perception of the inner self"" - it implies expression of feminity is either sexual or infantile. There is clearly a connection with how anime girls are designed and portrayed and TIM's views of women, if it comes down to not wanting to use pictures of real women there are tons of other art mediums depicting women. A lot of my friends use pictures of women from live-action shows or video games, because they're characters they respect. Personally, I've always just used images I find funny or interesting looking, probably stemming from the fear of retaliation/being treated differently by announcing I'm a woman on the internet. Saying TIM's use anime pictures because of a lack of any other choices to properly express themselves is a complete bullshit argument."

Having a special interest is a fairly common symptom of autism. It's defined more precisely as:

I personally know someone who is obsessed with ceiling fans as a symptom of their autism, and another who spends all their time reading about WWII and memorizing facts about it. Anyone who's spent enough time around autistic people has probably heard of the fire truck joke. You can read about it here: https://www.ambitiousaboutautism.org.uk/understanding-autism/behaviour/obsessions-and-special-interests

It's an interesting hypothesis that autistic people show high levels of interest in anime beacuse of simple facial expressions but it's way more likely that autistic people just show interest in topics in a way that other people don't and since anime is extremely popular among young people it makes sense that a lot of people on the spectrum would be exposed to it as well."

A quick exploration of the art tag on tumblr or Twitter shows this. TIM's are ""allowed"" to do whatever they want, but there's justifiable criticism in them relating to infantile or sexualized drawings over literally anything else. There is offense in anime girls being chosen as the easiest way to identify yourself as female, it shows a serious problem in the way feminity is perceived and using it as the end all to be seen as a verifiable woman propagates that idea. Literally a jpeg of a pink heart as an avatar would be read as female by anyone. Relating to an anime girl clearly goes deeper than just wanting to be seen as a woman.

There is no robust, international, definition of transition - currently the gender fascists are clear that you a) need to transition medically; b ) need only take ""cross sex"" hormones, c) change your outward apparel (and if you feel the need, your hair), and d) just need to announce your pronouns.

They were also holding up ‚ÄúPROTECT TRANS KIDS‚Äù signs or something like that... like alright... you keep on protecting children by advocating that whatever they say about themselves is true, messing around with their puberty and hormones and sterilizing them, doing god knows what to their healthy genitalia and rendering them pretty much unable to ever experience sexual pleasure, turning them into ‚Äúdrag kids‚Äù and exposing them to degenerate kinks and fetishes at the pride parade, in schools, in libraries, and in the media...

There is nothing stopping the TIM participating in powerlifting for fun. Why do they act as if they have a right to compete, when in their own division they wouldn't have ever had a chance due to being mediocre?

What about the women athletes' desire to compete, which the TIMs infringe on?

Also: ""trans athletes should be celebrated fiercely"".

No they shouldn't. Why should they? Why should mediocre men be celebrated at all when competing with women? It's the women pushing the capabilities of their body that ought to be celebrated, bit some enourmous awkward-looking blook with long hair who fancied a go 18 months ago.

>	Removal of Testosterone today does not remove the advantages of Testosterone in the past.

>	Although it is clear that reducing T to female levels does reduce current muscle size and red blood cell levels in males, it does not reverse the impact that T had during puberty. Puberty and early adulthood was when the size and shape of the male body was formed. It is well known that males are larger, have longer limbs, a larger rib cage with larger organs like heart and lungs, bigger hands, their legs are more vertical due to a narrow pelvis, the list goes on. The male body is optimised for physical performance. In contrast, in females there is an evolutionary trade-off between physical performance and the ability to bear children.

>	Future advantage due to muscle memory:
There is considerable scientific evidence now that muscles built under the influence of Testosterone will be easier to build in the future even in the absence of Testosterone. Links HERE, HERE. ‚ÄòMuscle memory‚Äô means that if an elite athlete takes performance-enhancing drugs, they may continue to be at an advantage over their competitors even if they stop taking the drugs. This is why elite athletes can have their titles removed retrospectively if they are later found to have taken performance enhancing drugs at any point in the past (not just at the time the title was acquired).

>Therefore it is likely that male-born transgender athletes who once trained under the influence of natural testosterone will forever be at an advantage over female-born competitors never exposed to such high T levels. Read an excellent short review on this topic HERE.

>	Even low levels of male-competitive advantage will dramatically change sporting outcomes.

>Suppression of Testosterone by male-born transgender athletes undoubtedly reduces their athletic performance. However, the key question is ‚Äòby how much?‚Äô It is highly likely that some competitive advantage will remain due to being born and developing as male. This is also borne out by the observation that many male-born trans-athletes are rising to the top of female competition. Link HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE.

>Seeing male-trans athletes rising to the top of female sport is inevitable because the difference between winning and losing at elite level is so small. Analysis of the performance differences over the last 3 Olympics confirm exactly how small that difference is. Link HERE. The average difference between winning Gold vs Silver is only 0.8%, for Bronze and no medal is 0.4% and making the final or not is 0.3%.

I ask because I've seen the trans community butt heads with the black community before... noticeably, when trans activists were showing up to Black Lives Matter protests and trying to shift the narrative to Black Trans Lives Matter.

What is their bone density like? Are white woman‚Äôs bone density reduced because of a low calcium diet in the North America‚Äôs? 

What TiM‚Äôs are really trying to say is black Woman are more masculine and less woman then a white woman. That‚Äôs the crux of this foolish argument.

2770,nocommentyet,"It's a little complicated. There are some really vocal supporters of transgender activism who are black, generally they are young black women and black gay men. 

I have always thought this is because in the black community, most of the trans-identified males we're exposed to are people who have been trans since they were teenagers, suffered through prostitution and other indignities, and are usually not very activist at all. They exclusively date men. Most of them are actually gay men and they are our relatives and while the black community has a reputation as being homophobic, when push comes to shove we are far less likely than other groups to exclude our people because they're not straight, like cutting people off or disowning people. So we stay around each other.

The trans activist types posted about here in GenderCritical, well many of them are more like fulltime crossdressers who identify as lesbian so they can get closer to women's spaces. I have never known any black trans male who identified as a lesbian, not saying they don't exist now, but that is well outside the norm for us. I've seen black trans people since I was a kid and never seen a Caitlyn Jenner type either, the kind who don't transition until they're late in age. 

So I bring all that up because I think the young woke black people who support trans activism have our kind of trans people in mind. Outside of them, I think the opinion on this is very strong in skepticism towards trans activism, very strong. "

When you consider the racial/ethnic stratification found in social classes, & we know class impacts education, which impacts types of employment), we could argue instead that it's being working class that increases bone density & that black women are more likely to be working class."
2773,YoureNotaClownFish,"Just an aside...North America has around the highest calcium consumption anywhere in the world (‚ÄúMilk dos a body good‚Äù and all), but we most likely have such poor bone density due to the amount of animal protein in our diet, which requires our body to pull calcium from our bones to keep our blood alkaline enough.

As for  new construction, if all restrooms are going to be gender neutral, women will never have privacy or security again.  I fear that it will be a positive sign for predators to ply their criminal behavior even more toward women and children.

Besides ""women are nurterers and want to help TIMs be comfortable and if you don't agree then simply screw what women want"" I could see the average person's logic also being that men might be uncomfortable at open urinals with women walking past.

Oh but that‚Äôs right, their kind doesn‚Äôt believe that women and men have different bodies. It‚Äôs just politics in all the medical resources where they document that men have on average significantly more muscle and less fat than women.

2844,Areliae,"Sorry, I don't normally comment (cause man) but it seems relevant.

The reason this issue exists is that men aren't bothered by it. This isn't due to ""strong men"" or something ridiculous, it's just the resulting comfort of a privileged class. The entire world is our space, so having a separate one really isn't important. They also aren't at risk for assault, don't have periods like women do, and don't really experience sexual harassment (to anywhere near the same degree). If I saw a women in my bathroom I would not be bothered. I'd probably just think ""huh, good for her,"" and go about my business.

And, of course, since this applies to us it must apply to every other human being on the planet /s. Or maybe it's just that it doesn't affect us, so these guys don't care."

None of these men have any right to decide what haircut anyone but themselves is getting. If they don't like what their girlfriend or whoever did with her hair, they should either live with it like the rest of us, or if they *must* and it's okay in the relationship they have, they can point out they liked the one before better or whatever, with no expectation to get a reaction beyond ""okay, but I prefer it like this"".

In my country it's just the norm basically, it breaks my heart to listen to grown women talk about how their boyfriend/husband don't allow them (as if they were children) to cut their hair a certain way, dress a certain way and so on. It's infuriating, I always use those moments to let them know they shouldn't allow this behaviour. I have short curly hair and women my age usually tell me about how they wish they could get a similar haircut without annoying their boyfriends and my heart breaks a little bit each time, many relaxed their hair cause their boyfriend/husband don't like curly hair. You're not supposed to comment about any of it cause it's ''between them'' people say."

2948,tervacious,"I had a similar convo with my stylist when I brought up changing my hair radically. She laughed and said, check with your husband first. Mind you this is in a hipstery joint in Wokeville.  I was like har har har and she gently was kind of like, oh I've gotten in trouble with husbands before and went on to recount numerous instances of women coming in and redoing haircolor (always demanding that the women go lighter/stay light, or demanding that the women cover grays) and straightening hair of clients who wanted to go naturally curly but going back to straightening it because their boyfriends/husbands hated it. And men storming in when their wife's haircut was too short and demanding they refund him rather than the woman who paid for the haircut!

She said she had one client whose husband accompanied her on her appointments and told the stylist how to cut this woman's hair, and how blond it should be. I assumed this was some trophy wife situation and she was like um no this woman is in her 60s and her husband wants her to maintain the same color she's had for like 40 years.

You know that whole Keanu girlfriend thing? It's like that. What we do with our hair is so scrutinized, we spend $$$ on it and can't take it lightly because of the reaction we get. It can range from mockery to job loss to violence. Women are drowning in privilege over here."

Not that long hair makes things okay. Then it‚Äôs the wrong color, then it‚Äôs ""why do you have your hair up in a bun"" (in fucking July), then it‚Äôs ""why did you trim your hair so that it‚Äôs only shoulder length"". All said by women."

2955,Pushy_galore,"I work in domestic violence/woman abuse and I read this a little differently. It seems to me that the stylist may be living with an abuser or her partner/father etc is abusive. It was the whispering that did it for me. A woman who has not experienced abuse and has heard some stories about ridiculous and threatening misogynistic abusers storming into the salons of friends would not necessarily give a toss and call security or cops right away to have him removed.  I am thinking that the stylist herself is living with it or has in the past. If she is, there is 24/7 help to move away from a controlling abuser. 
I have been doing the work for years now and years of hearing stories about these #$&holes has caused me to tell everyone I meet the three golden truths about woman abuse.  A male abuser is ALWAYS misogynistic in his thinking, abuse is ALWAYS deliberate and used to maintain control and abusers will ALWAYS play the victim and try to get his partner to feel complicit in the abuse."
2956,smiolet,"It enrages me, too. 
Domestic abuse is horrifying. I got bangs cut when my spouse couldn't come with me to the hair appointment, and was so angry. Apparently i should have consulted first. But I wanted bangs. This was 4 years ago. I later found out from my hair dresser that my spouse went  to my hair dresser, stormed up to him and told me he could never cut my hair again, along with many profanities. 

It was common for me to be told to put on makeup and do my hair in specific ways before I could leave the house with them, or if we had social plans. Even just going to the gas station I had to look 'hot'. Heavy makeup, straightened hair, and I learned it was best if my clothes were not showing too much skin but if they were tight, always had  to be approved or denied.
It was all about control and appearance. Cutting my hair without permission was treated like a massive betrayal.
But in the same way, when out with my spouses friends, if I was told to kiss Lester or show them a body part of mine, I had to comply. One time we were drinking and my spouse told J to let me touch his dick so I could see how small it was. I thought they were joking, until my spouse starting getting angry that I hadn't come over to them. When I did they whispered that J had no sex for years and it would be really nice of me to touch him, that he had a crush on me, he was depressed and it would make him so happy. My spouse took my hand and I was shaking and stuck it in his pants. I started crying and J was going yes yes thank you thank and my spouse was moving my hand, kept pinching me and saying come on be nice! 
My body was their property to them, but they liked to 'show' me off and to 'show' their friends my body and what it was like being with me.  They felt good when their friends complimented me to my spouse, sexually. after having to touch J's penis I was angry, but when I tried to tell them while we were going to bed they pulled me out of bed by my hair and said I had to listen to them.
We are not together anymore. Not divorced yet, but separated.

I kind of laughed it off and she then told me how her boyfriend wouldnt let her cut her hair shorter, even though she always wanted to try it out. He actually told her he would consider breaking up with her if she went shorter than shoulder length. I would've laughed in his face if my boyfriend said something like that, but she kind of accepted it as a part of being a woman in a relationship. It ridiculous."
2964,Mother-of-Rats,"I have demon hair.  It's fine, there's lots of it, it's not quite curly, not quite straight and I have a double crown.  Basically I look like I've stuck my finger in a light socket and have barely escaped a vicious attack by birds on a daily basis.

Since I've been married I've grown it long, dyed it blue, purple, fire engine ref and some more natural colours and even completely shaved my head.

Every time I do something drastic to it, the stylist (I'm cheap so I just go to Super Cuts or whatever) 99% of the time asks me if it's okay with my husband.

I never really thought anything of it (he doesn't care what I do to my hair unless he's the one trying to get it untangled from a zipper without scalping me) until one day I was in the chair having a perm (no, it did not turn out well) and the woman next to me was having high lights.  Her husband came in, I assume to pick her up or something and saw that she was getting highlights done.  He went off on her, called her a whore and threatened to leave her.  She was crying and had the stylist take the tin foil things out and wash it out asap.  When they left (he was still yelling at her) we all looked at each other like ""WTAF just happened?"" and my stylist said to me, ""you know, that's not the first time that's happened here.  Men.""

The boy looked a bit like he belonged in an 80‚Äôs metal/rockband (this was before manbuns were a thing).  Vagabond style. 
The girl took a lot better care of her hair but it still looked a bit like two huge curtains of thick curly hair hiding her face. 

One day she, spur if the moment, got it cut to a much cuter above the shoulder cut. More than half of her hairlength gone. 
I will admit she was nearly unrecognizable but nothing else changed right? Still a funny cute girl, only difference is he could actually look her in the eye now without the hair curtain. They‚Äôll be fine right?

I was honestly scared she would hurt me (she was abusive). But for her, she said long hair looks better on both women AND men so idk how rooted in misogyny her long hair obsession was. 

Still, I feel so happy now that I cut my hair! It's liberating and if men don't like it they can fuck off.  It's horrible reading about women who can't cut their hair because of men in their lives...like holy shit, women are not free if they need PERMISSION for a haircut!

 I'm curious to see people's reactions when I go into work tomorrow...I'm sure I'll be told I ""looked better before"" and I can't wait to tell people I don't care lol. Maybe I'll even buzz it off.

2978,Meonspeed,"A friend of mine who is a stylist told me that her cosmetology school added a course on domestic violence as a requirement for graduation.They learn the signs that a woman might be unsafe and how to talk to them about it, what steps to take. Sad that it's needed, but glad it's being taught.

I remember when my marriage started getting really abusive my mom paid for me to get my hair done while I was visiting her out of state to lift my spirits. In the hours I spent in the chair I told this young stylist everything- all my secrets, the raw and honest truth about how brutal he had been, things I normally downplayed or hid from my family, friends, even my psychiatrist. I was planning on leaving him and asking the state's attorney to prosecute him for the domestic battery charge he had been arrested for and I just needed to say it out loud, and she just let me spill it all without any shame or judgement. 

I saw her a year later, and told her I was back with him, he had changed, he was wonderful to me again like he was in the beginning blah blah blah. She looked anguished and said ""I can't tell you what to do, but I don't want the next time I do your hair to be for your funeral"" Those words stuck with me, I never forgot them, or the compassion she showed me that day.

I finally left him for good in July. Having a hearing for the plenary order of protection right before Christmas, which I'm confident I'll win, and then I have my appointment with her scheduled for December 28th. I'm really looking forward to updating her on everything."

Anyway, I remember the hair stylist asking me a ton when I was a teenager if I was positive I wanted all my hair chopped off. I kept reassuring her. Of all people, my mom got angry with me. She said I looked like I was a boy and called me ugly and was so enraged,. She didn‚Äôt threaten to kill anyone, but I remember distinctly my excitement of the haircut going from feeing free to getting sick that night/the next day. I literally was throwing up over HAIR. 

I don‚Äôt understand why our hair matters so much to people. I know my mom loves me and probably has no idea how much that hurt (maybe doesn‚Äôt even remember flipping out...she was abused as a kid), but it definitely left a scar on me mentally. It probably played a role in my transition too. Everything I loved being ‚Äúbad‚Äù because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfor girls.‚Äù

2993,,"I was a hairstylist for a decade and I cannot begin the enumerate the times that I would tell a client that a new short haircut would suit their face, be easier to style, would be fun and chic or would be told ""I would love a short haircut but my husband would kill me"". 

This didn't just apply to short hair but also to blonde hair color. I once had a client who had highlights that really didn't suit her and we kept talking about doing something darker that would look healthier and be easier to maintain. We did a pretty light brown that was no where near raven black and her husband called me at the salon to cuss me out and threaten me. He said that I was a ""fucking bitch"" who wanted to make his wife ugly ""because you fucking feminists can't leave it alone.""

I saw women bleaching their already fried ends to smithereens to keep their husbands happy. And then the husband would come in and I would meet him-- I was aghast! These men were always pudgy, dough-y and bald. I hate that women get trapped by the expectations of these men and it is enraging."

2998,Pikangie,"It's so sad... for such a trivial thing which should be all her own choice, her body.

It reminds me of a video I saw on Facebook, where a woman was stuck with her abusive partner and she had to trick the man to let her (accompanied by him) let her pet go to the vet. There she very stealthily slipped a written note to the desk staff to get help and warn that her partner has a gun, because that was her one and only chance to escape this abusive relationship, due to being kept locked up inside by him any other time. I am glad how the staff there handled it, and he was arrested by police.

But the sad thing is that this seems to be one of the few ways women have been able to find safety from such abuse where they are treated as hostages. It is not unlike the cases of serial killers abducting little girls and the girls' only way to escape would be things like tricking the man into friendship (that I won't be surprised if it involves enduring rape) til she can find opportunity to escape or get help, or distracting the man somehow to give her a chance to escape. The fact that this is as common as it is (and probably more than we hear cause of all the unsolved cases of abductions), while the other way around of boys being violently abducted by female serial killers is pretty much unheard of, it is really scary to be female."

3002,NW_Luna,"Wow, this is interesting. Up till 40 y.o. I'd always had long hair to about between distal scapula and waist. Most of the time would wear it in 1 or two braids, or up sometimes at work. I liked it because it was simple and I didn't have to get it cut or trimmed. Just wash it every so often. No fussing required, so very low maintenance. I recall one man telling me ""don't you find men think your long hair is sexy?"" and I said WTF? Huh? I suppose I was clueless about mainstream culture

Long hair is heavy, though, and mine was thick so especially heavy. I got it cut after 40 to about chin length, because I was tired of having so many HAs from wearing my hair up a lot. My husband was ""whatever you want"" when I told him I was thinking of cutting it, not that I would have paid him much attention about that -- it's MY hair! 

Frankly I find short hair is far more work than long hair. Short hair has to be trimmed/cut frequently, and has to be brushed/styled just so. My hair's thinned with age but still has a lot of (I guess it's called) volume, and looks weird to me. . With my long hair I just braided it back or knotted it up. Maybe trim the ends every six months. It didn't floof out several inches because there was enough weight to hold it down.

So I'm growing my hair longer again. Besides, long hair in a braid is common in many non-first-world cultures regardless of age. It's simple and straightforward."

It kills me because I desperately want to tell them to tell those dudes to worry about their own damn hair and grow theirs long if they like it so much, but they didn't ask me and I don't want to make them uncomfortable and I know not all of them are safe to do so.

3074,Nibbana0,I've seen women who look incredibly beautiful with short hair but get so much negativity they grow it out and never cut it again. Even today so many who really need to cut their old tired hair off at this point.
3075,ImPiqued1111111,"Interesting. As I've been scrolling down I've been puzzled by all the comments about men wanting women's hair to be long and I'm like, I have a pixie cut and I get plenty of male attention and I'm in my damned 40s. Well it's pale blonde so maybe that's it."

3083,TessKaos,"My grandmother thought long hair was childish. She berated all her grown daughters if their hair got longer than their collars. Called it ridiculous for a grown woman to have long hair. Of course she was of the generation that went to the salon for a ""set"" and wore kerchiefs to bed to ptotect the curls."
3084,ForsakenProfession,"But they all had permanents so it could be curly.  Curls, for some reason, were beloved and sought, even if short.  Audrey Hepburn made an impression with her ""pixie"" cut as well. 

I had boys--it was off to the barber for a buzz cut and they loved it, although they started growing long hair when they were teens in the 70s.  I just can't see myself spending hours doing long hair for a couple of  pre-K girls.  They would have had short hair also and taught how to manage it themselves.  I knew women who spent loads of money on hairdressers, but a good cut was all I asked for--and sometimes it was very hard to get."
3085,ForsakenProfession,"Too many girls and women actually think that ""he won't love me"" if I don't do exactly what he says and wants.  It really is pathetic that they are taught that.  It's up to us to spread the word that they should please themselves, not *him* or anyone else but oneself, unless you are doing someone a favor or service.  But just to gain approval from someone who thinks they can control you?  No, because they will never stop increasing what they want, along with  other means of controlling you to get it.

I like doing what I think is good for me and is right for me; I always have.  My biggest mistakes in life were trying to gain approval from some man, even if I thought it would benefit me."

3089,elvesdontgrowbeards,"Jesus, that's even worse, the oppression gets a shade of religion too, isn't it? There are many, MANY men like this in Hungary too and we are even more behind in women's rights than the West. But I'd still say that many other men don't give a single f about their girlfriend's/wife's/etc hair. Although my own father would be disgusted probably and he would say that I'm a lesbian(yes, it's a slur here, along with gay/faggot because these are supposed to be ""baaaad"" things), if I'd cut my hair short but I wouldn't care, he doesn't own me(never understood his logic, he has this extreme stance on other topics too). But my BF would be chill with it, we've talked about it. He would be sad for a short while but it would be completely okay.(He's strongly balding and he likes to run his fingers through my hair for some happy feelings :D)"
3090,kitcatkittycat,Agreed!! I will admit that with my ex I preferred his hair longer and made my preference known. I also took his opinion into consideration with my hair and sent him photos when I'd done things. I think in relationships there is a bit of give and take

Why how about a story where a mother was told her kid was sick and needed rest but the mother insisted that her son was fine well enough to keep performing in the play only to become unconscious and pass away all because his own mother wouldn't listen.

Or how about another story where both parents a Mom and a Dad treated their own child like property wanting to sell her off as it was her ""given right."" 

So yeah being a terrible person doesn't have to deal with what hangs between the legs but instead with how each given individual acts and treats others. I'll treat everybody the same way they treat me. Be nice to me and I'll do the same in return but treat me like crap and you get the same in kind."

People like this stompede over other people, and create a barrage of destruction in their path. If you're not 100% supporting of your father's demands, you're therefore totally against him, and must be demonized and destroyed.

No one wants to transition to just be an average woman it‚Äôs always got a huge element of fetish.

3126,Foltbolt,"Thanks for this post. A very interesting read and my heart goes out to you and yours.

Recently, Deirdre McCloskey (a famous TiM economist) wrote a piece published in the Quillette about his experiences after transitioning and one thing that leapt out was how his kids completely disowned him while he claimed he loved them and desperately wanted to be in their lives.

I kept thinking that ""If you had such a loving and healthy relationship with your kids before transition, this would not destroy your relationship with them. What the hell did you do to them that you're not telling us?""

Absolutely this. When I read any posts in r/inceltears, they read exactly like transcels. They reinforce the delusions with each other and it is a big circle jerk.

I just can‚Äôt wrap my mind around what a clever, well-orchestrated campaign they have created. There has been such a wholesale buy-in with the woke and handmaidens, as well as the straight community. 

The only possible explanation is that everyone knows that they are men, that trancels scream loudly and threaten violence, so, to keep the peace: compliance with their demand ensues.

The fable of the emperor that wore no clothes comes to mind. Everyone knew that he walked around naked but to avoid his wrath (and possibly their heads), everyone agreed that he wore a beautiful and fine set of clothing.

Transcels: naked and soulless."

I don't know what's going on inside his head fully since I only know what u have said but from what she/he's done I would say he/she is just using transitioning as another form of abuse, putting stress on the family. Which is also why real trans women who just wanna is put their life without being stereotyped as a violent abuser get abused so badly, because so many people use being trans as an excuse to hurt their family, sexually harass/assault people and other stuff too.

3190,nini551,What exactly are you getting at here?
3191,Neehigh,"Dunno, friend, silent rebellion is better than vocal support.

And, like all things done for attention and validation, they‚Äôll move on to some different form of it once their button-pushing gives them nothing but silent stares and pity."
3192,finallyaboy,"Well, I'm glad to hear that. Your family deserves it, after what you went through. It's sickening how fetishistic they are, and now he's dating people half his age."
3193,AnyGirlInSydney,There is no ‚Äúbiology‚Äù backing trans behaviour. It‚Äôs a cultural phenomenon. For adult male AGPs transitioning like in the example here it‚Äôs a manifestation of patriarchy that arises from bingeing on porn and male entitlement.

3195,mountainmammoth25,Jesus what the fuck is it with these narcissistic psychos. All the trans people I know (usually in discord servers where there are more people I like than don't so I tolerate them) are just the weirdest most self serving people I know.
3196,AnyGirlInSydney,I think being pornsick (bingeing on porn) has a lot to do with it. It warps their brain.
3197,nini551,"Hahahaha no. They wouldn't be parading their dicks around the women's locker room if that were the case. And that's just the autogynephiles. I do a co-ed activity that for some reason still unknown to me attracts a ton of HSTS. And they can't shut up about how they think they are superior to actual women, how vaginas are gross, how actual women don't know how to suck dick or do makeup like them, etc.

They have little to no interest in women for any reason, or actually trying to be one. They are focused on men and getting men's attention. The main time I really see them paying attention to any woman is when they are jealous she is getting a lot of male attention.

But autogynephiles especially have zero desire to blend, except for specific cases of individuals who are turned on sexually by blending."
3198,AnyGirlInSydney,"Do you really see the ‚Äúmajority of TW wanting to blend in and pass‚Äù? Or is that just the narrative we get told ad nauseum? Every single TW (without exception) I‚Äôve seen/read/heard has demanded attention, and validation - going from merely dominating the discourse, wanting to be centre of attention, telling women we are wrong through to this sort of destructive, fetishistic, narcissism that tears families apart and causes trans widows to suicide."
3199,StupidHappyPancakes,"It *used* to be that way for many trans people.  People have been able to change their gender for several decades, and there weren't any major issues with those trans people trying to invade single-sex spaces or censor speech to fit their narrative.  They were subject to extensive gatekeeping and were expected to pursue SRS, and WANTED to pursue SRS to alleviate their dysphoria.  

Now most trans people want zero gatekeeping, no SRS, and forcibly infiltrating single-sex spaces and taking opportunities that aren't *meant* for them.  They say they don't even *have* dysphoria, yet they expect the taxpayers to not only cover their plastic surgeries but also their electrolysis, waxing, hair transplants, custom wigs, etc."
3200,raccoonTowel,"I agree. It's not that trans people are all visible and trying to be special, it's that those are the ones people keep focusing on because it's a better story. The large majority are just living normally and trying to pass. Very few people are just randomly choosing to transition because they want to be special. Trans people face discrimination, that's hardly something that someone's going to choose."
3201,TryingforMighty,"I've often said that what really drove me away was my ex's narcissistic entitlement.  In the end I have ended up being glad he was such an unempathetic and demanding person, or I might have talked myself into believing I could live with a person who demanded I remake myself in his image (of woman and much else)."

Now, if you‚Äôd like to continue, please speak out to acquaintances, friends, colleagues, other family members, neighbors, etc., and share what you‚Äôve learned here. It is an unfortunate truth that your voice has more of an impact as a male. Please use it. Seriously. It does matter. Many of us cannot speak out openly without fear of violence or career suicide.

3214,Nibbana0,"Well normally would agree, but this is being pushed by some very powerful people."
3215,,[removed]
3216,StupidHappyPancakes,"I'm definitely not trying to discount your own experience, of course, but I think that even if *some* trans people were born with that predisposition, the majority of people who are going trans these days *are* making a choice.  

When you think of someone ""choosing"" to be gay, it sounds awfully implausible because there's a lot of discrimination and shame that is still attached to being gay, plus it doesn't seem like someone could *force* themselves to be attracted to the same sex if they actually *weren't*.  

But if you think about a straight man who has a fetish for imagining himself as a woman, then turning trans lets him fulfill his fantasy full time AND with the current social and political climate, he can claim victimhood, oppression points, and maybe even tons of free, taxpayer-funded surgery.  

There is less and less gatekeeping, so such people wouldn't even have to go through the bother of getting extensive therapy first.   They also can gain an almost unlimited narcissistic supply as they take over women's spaces and censor their speech.  

Finally, if the TIM is a straight man, then he *doesn't even have to change his sexual orientation*; he can just call himself a transbian and continue fucking women.  If a man comes out as gay, nobody would fault his wife for wanting a divorce, but if a man comes out as trans, his wife is cajoled or even *bullied* into staying with him

I *do* believe that some trans people have some kind of inborn susceptibility to this, but they seem to be very much in the minority today and are frequently derided as ""truscum"" by their own community.  The majority of TIMs now don't have to bear the financial, social, or romantic costs that the old school transsexuals did, and somehow it's even okay for them to keep their penises and *still* demand to be recognized as women.  Figuratively *and* literally, they don't have any real skin in the game."
3217,4eyedPurplePPLeater,"All I can guess is that the (modern) movement attracts that type... besides old school TIMs, that I could kind of understand due to external & internal homophobia; it seems to be a different story with hetero TIMs, where they're just misogynistic AF at the heart of it all.       

Besides times/ places with extreme homophobia, why else would men decide going ""transition into a woman"" (a very stereotypical one at that)... unless they're being motivated for nefarious reasons...    

Notice they never really want to women -- they just want to pick & choose the parts they see as ""fun""... all the sexual aspects about it scream narcissism too when you think about it -- wanting to possess faux female body parts for themselves as their personal built in sex toys to get off to whenever, is as narcissistic & misogynistic as you can get.         

They don't even stay consistent with APG either, by claiming it doesn't exist one min, then trying to claim that one shit survey says women are APG just like they are! üôÑ"
3218,MusingsOfASoul,I think so. That's the sense I get from watching transyoutube videos or in subrreddits where trans people post about how they are so happy to be able to pass and not cause any commotion. Seeing the lengths they go through for this I suppose is a testimony as well. I think most trans people don't want others to know they are trans.
3219,MusingsOfASoul,"Yeah, I think like many issues and stances in life the truth or ""proper"" approach is somewhere in the middle. Like a pendulum it is probably the responsibility for both sides of debates to push back on each other to find the appropriate point in the middle (i.e. appropriate amount of controls before medical transitioning or other rights is allowed). I just hope both sides can find enough empathy and step in each others' shoes to find this middle ground unfortunately inevitable with any growing population there will always be bad apples. I hope good ones can eventually dominate the narratives, regardless of which side they are on, and open dialogue be preserved no matter your stance."
3220,MamaAintPlayin,He's a massive douche. Agree entirely. The stalking and online abuse from him & his fellow AGP narcissistic fetishists that Alice Dreger describes in Gallileo's Middle Finger is pretty chilling.
3221,TryingforMighty,Google it.  It's easily found and down-loadable.
3222,Spottini,"Exactly. People will always find a way to foist blame on the women who speak out, but this same crap versus children is no match."
3223,thrownawaybytheriver,"I'll do what I can. I've been testing the waters with my friends, and some of them seem receptive. I do think there are more people that reject the trans narrative than it appears just because of how loud TRAs are."
3224,AnyGirlInSydney,Are you asking me to prove something that does not exist? ü§î
3225,finallyaboy,"That's just from my own experience speaking. I don't believe transgenderism is innate, however, that's just speaking how it affected me. Then again, i was labeled ""truscum"" for who i felt, because i believed to be really trans, you need dysphoria.

Speaking from people who expereince real, legitimate gender dysphoria, as i did, it's not a choice. But, AGP transsexuals are making a choice i feel."
3226,AnyGirlInSydney,"It‚Äôs exemplified by the names they choose - Munroe, Charlotte-Rose, Michelle-Lynn, Chloe, Veronica Ivy etc. - it‚Äôs never plain old Lisa, Kim or Susan is it?"
3227,whinecube,"Right now trans widows don't get any sympathy from mainstream culture.  I am not usually a fan when men post here, but I am thrilled that men (sons) are starting to speak out about the damage trans culture is causing.  When men start speaking out, they will be listened to, and maybe we will see a shift."
3228,lavenderamethyst,"Absolutely there are. But no one feels comfortable to be overt about it. That‚Äôs why I advise that the best thing that you can do is ask questions and sew seeds of doubt. Don‚Äôt introduce talking points in their fully matured form. TRAs and liberals/handmaidens etc. have been inoculated against this. There are many ways to bring up a subject without naming the subject, and you‚Äôll find that when you approach it from this angle people easily agree with a central point. If you were to label it, then they‚Äôre able to deactivate thinking because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been trained to do. But nine times out of 10 they agree with you, and enough of those add up and a person starts to feel the dissonance. Just remember that anytime that you feel nervous because you‚Äôre around a bunch of liberals, the fact that you are male Does protect you. Look at all the people being raked over the coals for going against this ideology; they are all women, no men, not really. You can speak out and return to your regularly scheduled programming. If you want men like your dad to stop abusing, this is what you can do to contribute to the larger movement."
3229,AnyGirlInSydney,There has been some rudimentary research done on how people reach ‚Äúpeak trans‚Äù. One was when they encountered a toxic TIM - whether IRL or online (e.g. Jessica Yaniv was a gift for us). I imagine you sharing your story with people in your life could have the same effect.
3230,InsanelySaved1010,Yes. It isn't an unfalsifiable belief and I posted videos that confirm the opposite.
3231,trawid2016,I agree with this. It would be great if more men talked about this.

I know it's their personal business who they date and all but it's refreshing to see that they're not all like that and that *some* hope yet can be held out for men. Keanu seems like a cool guy all round üëç

Im 29 dating a 32 year old and I just get berated for it because im settling and Im a ""loser"" for dating an older woman who is overweight.

I mean, it is celebrity culture so they're going to judge her lol. Men are not alone in this. Most people seemed fairly polite wherever I was reading. Most ""rude"" comments were just like ""I can't believe she's only 46."" Which is a reasonable (if not especially sensitive) reaction to have.

Another norm.

What really gets me is how older men who are wealthy or famous are EXPECTED to have a girlfriend 1/3 his age and is celebrated for it but if and older woman has a much younger boyfriend, she as seen as a ""cougar"" or a whore or someone who is almost basically a pedophile (funny they don't see the irony).

There is also this double standard where if a young women pursues an older man, she is seen as a whore or having daddy issues but if a young man gets with an older woman, he is a hero and she is still called a whore.

And don't even get me started on the whole ""she's past her prime"" nonsense which never applies to men.

It seems in any\every situation, women can't get a break but the penis pass is always granted."

3364,4leafDover,">People lamenting that she looks old for 46 and couldn't possibly be that young can go screw themselves. 

&nbsp;

Severely enforced cultural standards train an otherwise intelligent animal,  humans, to have a lazy eye (brain, actually). People see silver or grey hair and think ""old."" 

&nbsp;

In post-colonial societies with Western-inflicted self-esteem complexes, any woman or man with a light complexion was deemed a great beauty and any dark-skinned person an ugly brute, totally irrespective of facial features. 

&nbsp;

When I moved to the West, I observed how conditioned people, especially males, were to considering as ""conventionally beautiful/handsome"" any blonde-haired person with a slim (female) or tall (male) build, again irrespective of facial features.

&nbsp;

I love how so few words perfectly encapsulates the current male social paradigms on the grand scale. Of course there's few like Keanu who simply don't let it get to them and live their lives and love as they please, but so many other men do all of the shitty things and hurt other people and choose partners (instead of other ""lower status"" partners they may have better compatibility with) *all because they want to impress other men.* Not because they want to be happy, not because they think it's what's best for themselves, it's all just to look good in front of other men whose opinions they take way too seriously.

^(not gonna lie, that seems kinda gay--especially considering these dudes are usually homophobic AF loool)"
3477,zazaleaz,"I found that term years ago and ever since, many things clicked and make a lot more sense to me. You would think that heterosexual men would prioritize heterosexual sex and relationships, but many heterosexual men are primarily homosocial. They are homophobic at the same time, so it creates a very odd dynamic. They can‚Äôt express their feelings toward other men without fearing being seen as ‚Äúgay‚Äù. One of the only ‚Äúnon gay‚Äù ways they have of bonding with other men is through their ‚Äúconquest‚Äù of women. Creates a very weird (and bad) situation for all of us, especially for women who are used by these men as pawns in their dominance game. It really has very little to do with sexual pleasure or connecting with women.

By the way, I think a lot of heterosexual women are primarily homosocial (self included)- we prioritize female-female friendship over heterosexual relationships, even though we are straight. But we don‚Äôt really need that word because this is seen a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for women and it‚Äôs not a problem for women to express our friendship love for other women. Women can prioritize female friends without worrying about losing our social standing among other women."

It's a choice men make to display dominance.

You know what's way more powerful than brute force and murder? Mercy. Forgiveness. Love. The things men despise and shy away from, preferring weak, cowardly violence. It's not a good thing to bond with violence, especially sexual violence. It fucks up everyone involved.

This is a pattern of behavior men are keeping around purposefully because it benefits them materially. They *could* hug it out and say how much they care for each other‚Äîthat's a better way to bond than getting together and gang raping some women in the Tribe. But they choose group rape over hugs. It's a choice.

None of this lizard brain cavemen nonsense excuses or explains men's current behavior. We don't have to hunt and gather, there are no mammoths or sabre tooth tigers attatcking us, *there is no danger to bond over.*

All of the recent wars the US has engaged in have been about money, power, and showing dominance. They're bonding over that‚Äîthe sexual violence and dominance‚Äîand decidedly **not** bonding over being brothers in arms defending the Tribe."

Sex is not work. 

And why would somebody want to pay another for sex?  I've never understood it.  Okay for $500 you get someone being nice and flirty for 30 minutes which I guess is a major reason men like this - it's more than just sex its the talking, the flirting, the touching - and as soon as their time is up, the act is over, and they don't want to have anything to do with you until you come up with another $500.  I don't see why any dude thinks this is ok.  

I'm sure some dudes confuse it with love and beg prostitutes for marriage and their bubble is burst when they find out none of it is real and the woman is only acting that way because money is involved.

No wonder so many men who are attracted to this have anger issues.  There's no real intimacy or connection yet it seems like there would be.  The only reason the woman is there is for the money.  She would be thrilled if the guy would just hand the money over without her doing a thing.

Can't believe teen magazines have morphed into these billboards for young girls and old men.  That's just gross.  Forget the gorgeous young man instead go for the wrinkled old guy.  No.  I would have never been happy with that."

There is nothing about sexuality in that statement and certainly nothing homophobic - you're the one suggesting men having sex with men is demeaning. Also, the vast vast vast majority of people that visit prostitutes are men.  What world are you living in where women visit prostitutes at anything near the rate men do?"

If a man asks for custody, he gets it. He can be convicted of any number of crimes against children in general, women in general, his own children, the mother of his children - makes no difference.

Pride marches have been taken over by T so perhaps they could be scaled back or re-purposed.  Acceptance and blending in with the crowd is what was aimed for in the first place.
3765,UpsetSwing,"I had a friend/colleague ask me about transing kids. I essentially said I thought is was a progressive form of conversion therapy and she sighed in relief. She said she didn't want to come off as offensive or bigoted, but that she had worries about medical transing of kids. I assured her not all LGB people agree and many want to distance the movement from TRAs. You may be surprised to find out that your friends and family are not on board, but like you are being silenced out of fear of being labeled a bigot. I'm glad she felt like I would not judge her and that she could ask me an earnest question. Perhaps there is someone you know like that?"

Respectfully, that's not what happened. The progressive wing has been focused on economic justice, and the neoliberal wing has been pushing identity politics. I often become confused when people attribute the sjw/identity politics phenomenon to progressives, because as someone who was deep into the 2016 election and closely follows politics here, that's not at all reflective of the truth. Maybe the neolibs tried to coopt the word ""progressive""? There was an attempt but I didn't think anyone bought it."
3772,fuckincaillou,"Because it falls back on that old BS of gender roles dictating men must do this and be this way, and women must do that and be that way, with no allowance of any personal choice. It reinforces the notions that dictate things like how women are responsible for men and that men are not responsible for themselves, that men being violent is normal and okay, that it‚Äôs okay for men to be unfairly participating in relationships and kids and domestic duties, any and every sexist norm that has gotten all of us into this hole in the first place‚Äîbecause the trans ideology relies on the existence and perpetuation of those concepts to have any legitimacy.

3778,,"When Russia first opened up their ""Internet Research Agency"" they had no real objective other than simply to create chaos.  They supported anything that might be divisive or get people angry.   For example, they managed to create a pro-Muslim online group and then scheduled an IRL rally for that group outside a mosque in the United States.  At the same time, they created a separate anti-muslim online group and then scheduled for that group to have an IRL rally outside that same mosque, at the exact same time.  Neither group knew that the other group was going to be there, and neither did the local police, so there was definitely potential for violence.

They also liked to inflame racial tensions.  For example, whenever there is an incident of a white cop shooting an unarmed black person, they'd flood facebook with ads urging black americans to ""rise up against white supremacy"" stuff like that.  Anything to make a bad situation worse.  Then once Donald Trump started making pro-Russian comments, the entire focus of the operation switch from ""create chaos"" to ""get Donald Trump elected as President.""  Of course, those objectives aren't mutually exclusive, so they didn't really drop their first objective so much as continue pursuing it in a different way.

But despite all that, I don't think that Russians have anything to do with the trans movement, or at least, they aren't the driving force behind it.  The trans movement is funded by medical corporations first and foremost."

It also reminds me of something silly like the CIA would be wont to pull (along with bat-bombs, cat-spies, LSD mind-control studies, etc). I'm just not sure what the CIA would gain from such a move, but who knows? What's definitely certain is that mental health is still in its childhood (we're on the fifth decided-by-committee ""bible"" of 'what is a mental illness, exactly?') and often focuses on drugging people with pharmaceuticals with harsh side-affects over the hard work of actual therapy. 

Then there is the medical profession which has never seen a drug it didn't like, focusing on treatment rather than prevention because it's more profitable. The medical profession loves trans nonsense: hormone blockers, hormone replacements, drugs to deal with the terrible affects of the blockers and replacements, mutilative surgeries such as ""top"" surgeries (read: removing a woman's perfectly healthy breasts) and ""bottom"" surgeries that are so laughably bad that even most trans people don't bother with them. The ""state-of-the-art"" female surgery (I had a chance to look at my friend's binders and pamphlets: he's getting his surgery covered by the state, while my husband can't even get a root canal covered) is blending up a woman's uterus and ovaries and vacuuming them out, and creating a ""phallus"" from thigh skin. The ""state-of-the-art"" male surgery is castration and cutting off one's dick, and then stitching the remnants of the scrotum with some thigh skin to create a ""neo-vagina"" which is just a literal gaping wound that has to be ""stretched"" (read: the body desperately wants to heal, to close that gaping hole, but is prevented from doing that) and is a useless ""hole"" as far as any actual penetration is concerned, has barely any feeling, and is extremely prone to infection, and the surgery, is more often than not, ""unsuccessful"". Kids and young adults are being gaslighted with trans ideology, having their bodies mutilated, and closing the door on normal sexual behavior and relationships forever. Not to mention, this adversely affects gay kids."

3808,goblinf,"what pisses me off about this is before I was 40yo, whilst my life and career was being totally ruined by my ridiculously heavy constant periods, I wasn't allowed to have a hysterectomy until there was no chance of having kids and early menopause has risks. This was a decade ago. The gynae issues pushed my body so far to it's limits I'm now housebound and was bedbound for a few years, I've lost 7 years of my life to this collapse of my body, my friends, my career, my social life, for a while the ability to read on screen, and the ability to walk.  Yeah it's a comorbid condition but I am pretty damn sure if my gynae issues were under control it would never have got this bad.   


When I asked about hormones the male gynae laughed and said we can't control the dosage well enough to make  difference, the human body is to complicated.And yet if I'd been smart enough to say oh I am in the wrong body I want to be a man, it would have just taken a few counselling sessions and boom. I say smart, that's not what I mean, I think the way surgery is so casually provided and hormone treatment is appalling for future health of these individuals.  I honestly don't believe medical science has moved sufficiently fast in 10 years to change what I was told then.

What's my point? If it's dangerous for me as a hetrosexual woman to have a full hysterectomy at 40, then why isn't it dangerous for far younger women to have 'bottom surgery'?  This is so wrong. It is voluntary FGM. I've been failed and THEY are being failed - for different reasons, but effectively the same procedure."

No one here is saying bisexual people are more oppressed than anyone else, or that lesbians don't have it worse. I am saying woman to woman, it isn't cool to say we will fuck them.

To add that women who know they don‚Äôt want kids are frequently denied sterilization procedures. Yet if they wanted to sterilize themselves in the quest to ‚Äúbecome a man‚Äù it would be okay."
3815,weretomato,"The easiest way to describe it would be in two ways. One what do we make of racism when there are POC in power who are just as abusive of other POC as the white people in power? Something is missing from our analysis of systemic racism. Similarly, what do we make of women in power who are just as abusive to other women as men in power? Something is missing from our analysis of systemic sexism.

If we follow the logic, especially of the kinds of feminism and anti-racism favored by liberals or capitalists, then it's perfectly fine to be oppressive if you just have a diverse group of oppressors. What's desired is equal access to the upper class not the destruction of oppressive class systems.

Just take a look at recent history: Obama, a black man, happily bombed brown people to oblivion for big oil, military contractors, and national hegemony. Hilary Clinton, a white woman, was more than happy to help. She was also more than happy to take dirty bank money in the form of ""speaking fees"". 

The critical missing piece in many analyses of systemic oppression is the systemic oppression itself. For example, what exactly is the patriarchy? Why does it exist? How does it exist when there are women in power? How does it exist when women are the majority of the population? Sometimes you'll get ""radical"" (to the root) answers, and other times you may get something like an evolutionary biology or historical answer. That's because there are many ways to look at a problem. 

The ultimate issue, a socialist or communist would say, is that feminism isn't compatible with capitalism because capitalism is a system that favors exploitative hierarchies, of which sex has been one of those hierarchies. If feminists want to destroy the root of sexism they have to destroy class-based oppression, not just for themselves, but for everyone. 

According to a socialist/communist, if you keep capitalism, you keep oppressive hierarchies, and feminism accomplishes nothing except make conditions cushy for the women who happen to be sitting at the top, while the women at the bottom suffer."

3817,,"But no one's telling anyone that bisexual women should fuck them? Just that, *unlike lesbians,* bisexuals have the *possibility* to be attracted to them - which is as far as I'm concerned is not either forcing bis to have sex with them or ""offering them up to them."""
3818,goblinf,"it was worse than that. back in the 90s I had private health coverage. but you needed gp to recommend to see a specialist to be covered. My hormones were everywhere, so was the blood, and my gp made me go see a mental health nurse for 6 sessions in return for agreeing to refer me to the private gynaecologist. These days it wouldn't have been allowed.

Said mental health nurse (i'm crap at names but I remember hers) had nothing useful to say, I'd already booked a holiday abroad so couldn't make the last session and I forgot to rearrange it when I got back. Damn woman put on my medical records that I refused to engage and didn't finish the course of treatment and that I put 'very little effort' into it. Thankfully several decades on that's now dropped off my record after one of the many changes of doc when I moved house. But I still am annoyed by it. I don't hold grudges but I have a long memory for that sort of crap.  


And I agree, it's an uneven playing field. In particular with sterilization vs. trans. How is that any different? it's still mental isn't it? wanting to be a man vs. wanting not to have kids. Yeah someone can use the pill rather that sterilisation but a girl can wear a sock in their crotch and invest in some gum arabic and fake hair equally easily. It doesn't make any logical sense that trans is encouraged unless there's money in it somehwere for someone... And it's making money from vulnerable people, and that's against the hippocratic oath."

Define 'female' under the TRA mindset. Sometimes a 'dysphoric' TIM can love their penis and just want boobs to go with their penis. Their dysphoria doesn't have to follow a normal female body to be considered valid by the trans community. So they can also have 'dysphoria' about not having both a vagina and penis. I assume then that you support surgery to achieve these mentioned goals."

I've known girls growing up who were depressed to the point of being suicidal because they thought they were ugly, their breasts were too small, they were too fat, etc. Why don't they get government funded plastic surgery?

3894,4eyedPurplePPLeater,"That's why south park made sure to make mention of that too (The PC babies are crying because ""Mulan identifies as a man & Disney didn't acknowledge it"".)        

This alone should've been a red flag to their supporters, when they started to trans characters & historical figures, based on clothing. There's countless women that had to dress as men to pursue jobs & relationships they weren't allowed too. To ignore that history is misogynistic AF, sending the message a woman is only a woman if they ""Identify"" with their oppression (basically agreeing with the patriarchy; that women are meant to be a certain way, & if not, they must not be women.)         

Everything out of the trans movement is old news. It's the same thing women have fought against over & over... but this time it's from the inside, with a bunch of men in dresses, hiding in a giant wooden unicorn."

3897,femurfatale,What! Mulan has to dress in men's clothes because she won't be taken serious as a woman. Was Arya Stark trans too? Same concept. She wore men's clothes so she would be *mistaken* for a man and less likely to be needlessly assaulted.
3898,rinabean,"Oh no, she was a man. So was Joan of Arc, charged with dressing like a man, but she was a man actually. Hatshepsut whose existence was nearly wiped out after her death because she was a woman, guess what, she was a man too! They're all men. Every girlhood heroine of ours was a man!

I had one just the other day try and tell me you know all those graves and those sexist archaeologists saw swords or whatever and said ""it's a man"" without looking at the skeleton, which are fairly easy to sex if you know what you're looking for, and recently they've found many were women, well actually those were all men too. How weird that true real feminism has found that the sexist men were right and women have always done as they were told. But that's just science!"
3899,,But REAL women are content with their gender roles and stay home in the kitchen. That is what they are telling us with this bullshit.

3901,PoeBoyFromPoeFamily,"Well said. 

&#x200B;

The same thing happened with a character from Assassins Creed. If you're into pirates, you might know of Mary Read. 

&#x200B;

She was dressed as a male because her brother died, and her mother only got support from Mary's grandmother to fund her brother, so Mary was dressed that way until she got older. She went into the navy, blah blah blah. She only ever revealed herself to be female when she got married, her husband died, she went back to male, but then she went into poly with Anne and Thatch, so she didn't feel the need to hide herself anymore.

&#x200B;

A lot of people started claiming she was a ""transgender"" and all the bs, and if you said anything to object it you would be sent hate messages.

But they clearly did no research on her, nor pirates back then, as females would dress as males, and reveal their breasts to show their victims they were killed by a woman. Anne and Mary were known for this."
3902,PollyannaPenny,"This is so fucking gross. Mulan was an inspirational figure to me as a little girl as well. It sucks that modern little girls are being taught that having strength, cutting your hair, and being willing to risk it all for someone you love like Mulan did makes you a ""man on the inside"".

&#x200B;

Also, anyone painting her as trans clearly didn't watch the movie. Mulan never WANTED to join the army or fight in that stupid war. Hell, the movie starts with her willingly putting on her makeup and dress and doing everything she can to impress the matchmaker and find a good husband to honor her family. The ONLY reason she disguises herself as a man and joins the army is because she's terrified of losing her father and would rather risk her own life than let him march off to his death. 

And, when she gets to the army camp, she is so laughably terrible at ""acting like a man"" that she nearly outs herself on multiple occasions and all her fellow soldiers think she's a weirdo. And, in multiple scenes, she complains about how much she HATES living with a bunch of dudes because of how nasty they are. And, after she's outed; she never puts on her male disguise again (even though wearing her female clothes puts her at a disadvantage when she tries to warn people about the Hun attack and no one will listen to her because she's a woman). Literally nothing about her behavior or stated desires in the film indicates that she secretly yearns to be a man.

&#x200B;

But, according to the trans/tumblr cult, Mulan isn't a real woman because a real woman wouldn't have risked her life to save a loved one. A real woman would just put on her nicest dress and cry on the fainting couch while her father was sent to his death."
3903,breadandrosestoo,"*unhinges jaw and lets out angry swarm of bees*  Don't fucking touch my favorite Disney movie!

3921,FTThrowAway123,"WTF. Mulan is a WOMAN who only dressed as a man to serve in the army, to spare her crippled father from serving, and dying, at war.  It's pretty clear that she only wore the disguise for that reason. She doesn't show any interest in women (which is pretty clear during the song 'a girl worth fighting for'), and in fact she seems to develop a romantic attraction to the general guy. When he comes back to her home after the war, she's living as a woman and is clearly interested in him. Just because she doesn't submit to traditional cultural roles that women would DOES NOT MAKE HER TRANS.  

I've heard people claim that the girl in National Velvet was trans too, like no, she cut her hair and dressed as a male after they realized the horse only trusted her and would not obey other (male) jockeys, but the horse racing organization only allowed men to compete as jockeys.  Literally children understand these concepts."

3925,loleelo,"Mulan has always been my favorite Disney story growing up because it was about a girl proving she was just as strong, smart, and capable as any man despite the adversity and sexism she faced. She was stronger and braver than any male she fought with.

Her story had nothing to do with her *wanting* to present as a man, and everything to do with *having* to present herself as a man so that she would be accepted by males (by disguising herself), because as a woman she was not taken seriously. You know, an issue women still face it to this day.

So infuriating."
3926,thekeeper_maeven,"This so much.

But you know who else wasn't trans? Anne Lister. She was a proud butch lesbian! Butches aren't trans and they aren't eggs. They don't need to be divorced from their birth sex, all they need is to be free to be themselves. They don't fit society's narrow expectations of women, but that doesn't make them non-women.

While she was attempting to be in the different stereotypical ""gender boxes"", she failed miserably. She wasn't a good ""girly girl"", but she also sucked as a ""manly man"".

3934,Star_Aries,"But the fact is that if we are supposed to believe that woman is a feeling and not a biological fact, Mulan CANNOT be female and do the things she did, because she would be too weak, too sensitive, and too busy cooking and cleaning. 

If we are to believe the trans narrative as fact, we have to accept Mulan as trans, as the alternative is accepting that men and women are capable of wearing the same clothes and doing the same things.

Not accepting Mulan as trans would also force us to accept female oppression as something real, and this conflicts with the female privilege of the trans narrative. 

Mulan, Jeanne D‚ÄôArc and women like them are a threat to the trans narrative, and they have to trans them as they cannot erase them from history.

3948,Kaynxrhaast,Oh my God. Did I just agree with some PC bullshit? I don't know what side is up anymore
3949,lgballiance,"Mulan is fantastic for criticizing gender roles all around. The intro is a criticism of societies forcing women and girls into demure and sexualized roles, and the song ""I'll make a man out of you"" is about unrealistic standards of masculinity imposed on boys.
The trans movement, on the other hand, is all about forcing oneself into a strict box based on the artificial gender roles one believes one portrays. Mulan's subtext is entirely antithetical to the trans movement."
3950,MistressChara,"Nobody thinks Mulan is trans outside of fevered headcanons. Mulan is a big deal in trans spaces because the struggles she goes through trying to fake being a man in the army/trying her best to learn how to ""be a man"" resonates with a lot of trans people. Plenty of Trans men use the song ""make a man out of you"" as a way to make themselves feel better when dealing with dysphoria or transphobia.   


It's also because there is so little positive representation of trans people in quality media that people latch onto whatever character or show makes them feel validated. Sailor moon for instance is popular among trans women because it allows them to live the childhood they never really got to live in a way.   


The whole point is finding empowerment. Not rewriting Mulan into being trans."

Responding to them imo gives their insane claim legitimacy. 
Also Jeanne d‚ÄôArc DID wear male clothing and that‚Äôs one of the reasons she was convicted of heresy.
I don‚Äôt understand why you are even saying this. She did wear male clothing and once she finally ¬´¬†admitted¬†¬ª her heresy (after being forced to) she was forbidden to wear it ever again. And then she was returned to prison and surprise! could only find male clothing (a trick by the English) and in order to avoid getting raped she was forced to wear it again. Therefore she was considered relaps which means she went back to heresy and the result is automatically death.
Which is what the English wanted all along: to burn her. Not for her to spend her lifetime in prison, which was the original sentence.

Women weren‚Äôt exactly allowed to be warriors at the time: just because a few women did choose that profession (Jeanne des Armoises for instance) doesn‚Äôt mean it was totes cool. It wasn‚Äôt.
Jeanne d‚ÄôArc was an exception and it was stressed that she did it to save the kingdom and because God had chosen her. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be a normal thing for a woman to be in an armour and be around men (especially since she wasn‚Äôt married) but she was a virgin and the situation was desperate.

I doubt she would openly speak about her menstruations to him especially when he called them ""the secret illness of women"". It's even more doubtful after all the inspections she endured. All confirmed she was a virgin with absolutely normal genitalia.

It's even more disrespectful to claim she was secretly a man, since her conviction was about her femininity. She was literally burned at stake for being a woman."
4038,thekeeper_maeven,"Yes, it has. There was a nosedive when it stopped being perceived as a pencil-pushing job and became a more respectable position. As the demand for programming surged, the women were pushed aside for male applicants. plus all the earliest home computers were all marketed to men in pop magazines (along with video games). So we saw these two budding interests become gendered practically overnight. 

I think it's interesting because it provides us insight into how gender imbalance and sexist ideas about capability begin. The older generation that saw this shift and were more aware of early female involvement were less likely to believe in sexist ideas than the younger cohort who simply observed the imbalance and made snap judgments like ""men are better at programming than women"". They observed AND THEN tthey justified their observations."
4039,nikitatx,"It has. I work for a consultancy, which in practice means I work on several projects a year with high profile tech clients. Every single time I go onsite to meet a new client, without fail there are almost exclusively men in engineering. Row after row, floor after floor. The one good thing about an open office is it makes spotting that really easy. 

What‚Äôs sad is that many of these companies participate in ‚Äúdiversity hiring‚Äù, and host events exclusively for women. I think that‚Äôs great, and more women are needed in all departments for these companies, but the majority of attendees are not software engineers. I honestly believe there are not enough female software engineers to begin with that diversity hiring doesn‚Äôt do anything to correct the root of the problem. We need to be teach girls and young women that math and science aren‚Äôt ‚Äúuncool‚Äù, and excelling at those subjects is a good thing. To me, it feels like some sort of unspoken taboo that a girl should not want to grow up to work in a STEM discipline, and _that‚Äôs_ what really needs to change."

4043,Thatstealthygal,How is it that there aren't heaps of historical men being redefined as transwomen? I only ever see it as women being redefined as trans men. It's almost as if there is some socio-cultural reason why women have historically presented as male in order to enter certain spheres or be independent. What could it be?
4044,Thatstealthygal,"Yeah. What I find odd is that these are all women being posthumously and ahistorically transed, presumably by transmen. Who are women. So their disdain for being female is SO profound that they happily refigure these amazing non-conformist risk taking women as trans, because they're projecting their own ideas about themselves on to them.  


But then again IS it transmen who are doing it? After all the person who  insists Kurt Cobain was a trans woman (uh, no seriously NO, he might today have decided to be NB at best) is female, no?"
4045,Thatstealthygal,"Of course they're not. But the women being touted as trans men of history are most of our role models.

Once again women are expected to.give up what they have to support other groups while men get a free pass.

Apparently it's more important that we do because of our history of.being oppressed or something. The line goes that we should be fighting harder for others because we once - oh so long ago, it's all over now - experienced oppression. It infuriates me."

I remember the debate in the 80's about girls in math and science (predated ""STEM"" as a term), with the influence of that ""Bicameral"" split brain crap still in the air, I heard women=language ability (soft) and men=technical or math ability.  Thing is, the brain is (in certain areas) divided and math and language come from the same side.  Either both are ""male"" or both are ""female""  (or neither). No split. We knew that then."
4056,GoshawkToday,"As someone who wanted to be an engineer and was pushed into arts and literature, I partly agree with you. I've heard people say what you said that girls need to learn that math and science aren't nerdy or uncool, but I'm not sure that is the main problem. 

A big problem I see that is very difficult to correct is informal learning environments, for instance boys who program hang around with other boys who program. By the time you get to a college environment, they have more experience and it can be discouraging. When I was in high school, most of my friends were interested in the arts and literature. We spent our spare time writing and reading poetry, drawing and similar things. By the time I got to college, I had a pretty developed skill set in those areas and a lot of confidence. In many STEM subjects I felt inadequate, not in terms of raw ability but in terms of acquired knowledge.

It was later in life that I went back to school and took some of the math classes I didn't have the time in my schedule to take when I was an undergraduate. When I learned to program it was in a summer session that was directed at career changers and about half the class was women, so the interest is there.

Trying to do things to counter act those informal learning environments could be helpful. It may not be a coincidence that the percentage of women in CS started declining shortly after the introduction of the desktop personal computer.

Of course, a lot of my experience is decades old and since I never had children I haven't kept up on what young people do. My step daughter is studying engineering, but I've never talked to her about how she decided that. I know my husband encouraged her interest in that a lot. 

I'd be very curious to interview college age women who did well on the math section of the college entrance exam but did not go into a stem field and find out why not. It's possible we could get answers we don't even anticipate.

I have some other thoughts on that subject, but I don't want to bore you."

4061,nikitatx,"I absolutely agree that informal learning environments discourage female participation from a young age, and in my personal experience that doesn‚Äôt change as one gets older. I think this is another puzzle piece that explains why more women don‚Äôt choose to work in STEM. 

Another piece is that once women do start in these fields, the environments in which we work are overly competitive and aggressive. I think about that quite a bit. I‚Äôm established in my career and refuse be forced out, but I also can really empathize with the women who choose to leave the industry. It‚Äôs not the outright harassment that wears me down as much as the constant and overwhelming soft sexism. 

I made the choice awhile back that I will no longer work for an organization run by a man. I know this position comes from a place of privilege though, and women with less established careers most likely can not afford to make the same decision as it severely restricts one‚Äôs employment opportunities.

How many times did you chant *marg bar umrika* that you believed the IRI‚Äôs bs propaganda about the West? Lmao Fox News, sooo tacky.

Sure Iran has the highest ratio of female to male post-secondary graduates but what is the female workforce participation [like](https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-business-and-markets/78671/iran-s-women-labor-force-participation-lowest-worldwide)? What is the point of getting an education when you can‚Äôt apply your knowledge or expertise? What is the point of pursuing your passion when you‚Äôre barred from entering (male-dominated) industries?

Tell me which regime implemented the educational institutions, which I‚Äôm assuming you benefitted from, and which regime implemented medieval laws that prevent women from working (ie asking the husband for permission first because that‚Äôs so liberal and feminist of the IRI)?

You know, a good portion of this sub stands in solidarity with WOC in countries where they still don‚Äôt have basic human rights or safety in public. Oh, which sounds exactly like the IRI.

Then along came one friend who questioned all of it for me. He asked me not to get pissed-off, but to just listen (*Devil's advocate, ready?*): *how can a physically intact man claim to be a woman, let alone a lesbian?*  
I immediately got defensive and he dropped it. But the cracks had formed. I eventually peaked and ended up here!"

4108,antigender111,"I hope one day to write a post on GC that makes Nick Parrot cry.

One of the (many) things that really pisses me off about Nick William Parrot is that an actual woman, even with the porn attire and drag makeup, would NEVER, EVER, get a sliver of the attention he does for his quarter assed ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù channel. 

If she were to dress the way Nick Parrot dresses she wouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously for a half a second. If she were to make the childish emotionally based ‚Äúpoints‚Äù that he makes in the vast majority of his videos she would be chewed to pieces by the Internet, not praised as a messiah.

Nick Parrot is not a particularly smart man. He was born into a wealthy family, he had an education that allowed him to posture and pretend he‚Äôs intelligent, but Nick doesn‚Äôt have any actual ideas of his own. 

He may be an empty husk of a man, but he is smart enough to understand, deep down, how much of a fraud he is. 

That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs still so unhappy even with all the attention and praise he receives. That‚Äôs why going on r/gendercritical ‚Äúmakes him cry‚Äù. It‚Äôs not because some women use the t slur and talk about his huge man hands (which by the way are huge indeed Nick you don‚Äôt pass), it‚Äôs because the women on here see straight through him. 

That‚Äôs what kills him, it is the refusal to submit to his fantasy that he is a Natalie Portmanesque waif of a genius, and not an aging, porn addicted, botched, talentless, mediocre man who tried to turn into his sex fantasy but wont be able to keep up the facade much longer :)"

4118,downofthepeach,"I used to follow him in the heyday of the YouTube atheist community when he had a few thousand subscribers. I remember the porn livestreams, his naive sexism, his pretentious aloofness, and that footage of him at an atheist meet-up where he got ridiculously drunk and had to be babysat by his friends, one of whom I think was his girlfriend for a while (a much more popular video maker at the time). He seemed socially awkward and a little bit sad. He disappeared, as did most of the rest of that community. 

When he came back as Contra, he made a couple of interesting videos and I wasn‚Äôt at all surprised that he was still a vainglorious aesthete but at least a little more sophisticated than before. Now the cultured pretty boy has truly come into his own. He‚Äôs the perfect face for the trans movement - he‚Äôs shallow, cynical, superficially charming and clever enough to fool stupid people into thinking he‚Äôs a genius. Thanks to the generosity of his followers, he can finally afford to be the libertine he aspired to be when he was twenty. But he‚Äôs still a sad, now rapidly ageing, nerd who has peaked in popularity. I don‚Äôt think his story will end well. I don‚Äôt wish ill on him, but he‚Äôs a woman-hating prick so I don‚Äôt wish him good, either. I think self-destruction is part of his ultimate goal, and will be curated beautifully, I‚Äôm sure."

But now it seems that every video lately involves more navel-gazing and obsession with very narrow issues. The last four videos are all mostly related to trans content and the particular issues with which Contra is struggling in the moment. Before, Contra talked about racism, fascism, cultural appropriation, toxic masculinity, things which impact people on a much larger scale. And now it's just stuff like ... plastic surgery? Pronouns? And angry feminists who hate trans people? And the conclusions are so wrong, or based on such incorrect assumptions, that it then makes me question the content of every other video which I previously liked."

Contrapoints‚Äô video on Gender Critical was really bad and neglected to address the issues that made me GC; like cotton ceiling rhetoric, trans women in women‚Äôs sports, and trans bullying of women who have the audacity to refer to their own reproductive anatomy  ( the bullying of women who wear pussy hats to the women‚Äôs march is what peaked me)

As a side note Contra acted out a TERF character in the GC video who was like a Wiccan earth goddess rad fem and I honestly started liking and identifying more with the parody character than Contra ."

That's why I'm disappointed. What happened to steelmanning? Jordan Peterson, incels, the alt-right, even the fucking golden one got a fairer shake than transmeds and and rad fems in your most recent videos. 

One specific example: In Transtrenders, Tiffany Tumbles says that she's trans because she has a gender dysphoria dx. The counter (contra?) argument? Gender dysphoria wasn't recognized until 2013! Ha! Except, (1) that's not how medical diagnoses work and even if it was, (2) gender dysphoria was just called gender identity disorder before then. That's just one of many. Are arguments that shitty supposed to actually convince anyone? I thought you were better than that. The quality and strength of your arguments has dropped.

I posted about it and encouraged people to get in touch with WNYC (the New York City NPR station) and let them know what a bullshit move it is to have a misogynist, TRA, former MRA advocating anything.  This was about a week (?) two weeks (?) ago.  The show was All Things Considered - you can go to the WNYC website, find the segment and listen.

* ""I'm not an anti-feminist, that's offensive. I'm just gender-affirming/""gender-euphoric"", even though gender is literally what male supremacists put in place to force women to look and behave differently from men.

But now that I've watched the video, just *uh*. It's even worse than I thought. Calling revolution to fascism can only mean he doesn't even understand basic marxist concepts.

4338,black-highlighter,"As much as people here ""take back"" ""TERFs"", it's really not a reactionary movement. It's second-wave feminism applied to the 21st century. The idea that women need their own spaces/orgs is 50 or 100+ years old depending on how you want to count, before ""trans"" was a sparkle in someone's underwear. It's like saying Stoicism is a reaction to Nihilism.

""TERF"" is much more akin to ""queer"", in that some people are offended by it because it's a vehicle for hate and violence, some people adopt the phrase as a form of resistance. To really believe the acronym describes a political group, you'd have to believe that feminists organize to ""exclude"" trans people specifically, which is clearly false. Feminists get together to exclude men, of which TIMs are a subset. This shows that ""TERF"" is a word authored from the TIM perspective, not the female. It literally centers men and erased women outside of their relationship with men. Hence: www.terfisaslur.com

4367,,"i feel like this is really easy to say when you live in a country where you can just ‚Äúidentify‚Äù out of womanhood. in most countries outside of the west, women are women because they have vaginas and can potentially produce life. women are oppressed because they have vaginas and wombs, because they menstruate, because they can have miscarriages, because they can abort fetuses, because they are physically smaller and thus more fragile. its these physical qualities that make them oppressed. these are qualities that no one chooses. its not just ‚Äúnot male,‚Äù and in fact, thats a very typically sexist view. the whole male is the default and female is just an afterthought (that kind of thinking comes from the patriarch‚Äôs manual: the bible, eve being a simple extension of adam‚Äîthe default human). 

you are a male. maybe you recognize that, but youre drawn to femininity. nothing wrong w liking feminine things at all. but youre literally mansplaining To Me, someone who was Born a Woman, what it means to be a woman. its not a special little feeling. its not about wanting to twirl in a dress. its not about opting out of maleness just because the expectations of manhood are too much, as if womanhood is Life on ‚Äúeasy mode‚Äù (which is what a lot of you seem to think).

im going to assume youre relatively young. truly, deeply examine what this path really means to you. oftentimes people transition to escape from mental illness. nick is a perfect example of that. i have anxiety disorders too. i am gender noncomforming too. but i respect that my body is my body is my body. gender isnt real. sex is something i didnt choose. the only real difference between male and female is biological; beyond that, anyone can be as masculine or feminine as they want.

just stop calling yourselves female and stop coming into lesbian and female only spaces and demanding equal treatment. female only spaces and lesbians exist to get away from penises. bodies are real. gender isnt. so plain, simple, and logical."

4373,,you should ask iranian penpal about sex-based oppression in iran. they might have some insights
4374,pleasedontuwume,"Bro im livin in islamic country, gay men are pushed to transitions and lesbians are not real here (cough correctively raped cough) cuz who would ever reject the mighty penis????? Iran as a society is homophobic as fuck, rather have a trans ""fake"" daughter than a gay son cuz a man is not a real man if he's being penetrated. It is not progressive, super sexist and should not be a standard of trans positive measure, it's fucked up."
4375,dulead,"I mean in regards to the whole male being default, I meant it as a bad thing. simone de beauvoir said that women are defined by their relation to men. Women are called the imperfect men and even Aristotle said some high key sexiest shit about women, which one can possit this line of patriarchal thinking is just deeply rooted in western thought. I hope one day we don't identify women by their biological abilities or organs because that would women who had their uterus removed for medical reseaons wouldn't be considered a women and that's messed up. 
I've never met a trans girl who has ever said that being a girl is life on easy mode, I've seen a lot of male cringelords who say that though and I'm more a pants/tight person I got scars on my legs I wanna hide. 
I did't think I was explaining anything in a condescending manner, you asked me what I thought it meant to be female and I answered with what I think it is. Sorry if to came off that way. simone de beauvoir said that a woman is able to make chooses like men and elevate oneself into a world of freedom where they won't be defined by their relation to men. 
I can't speak for other places but I'm fortunate to be here even more so after what my family went through and what I did when I was younger to be where I am but I did years of therapy and lots of deep soul searching. It was either this or suicide and I'm happy with this, I'm happy with who I am now. It wasn't a funny little feeling it was lain, lots and lots of pain because yeah gender isn't so logical"

4380,MagikalWords,"I'm not the OP, and I started to type out a comment. Then I decided to google what exactly Simone de Beauvoir said about choices and I find the exact paragraph from wikipedia you just paraphrased, including the mention to Aristotle lol anyway, here it goes the gist of my comment.

You talk about choices, women not shaving their legs or deciding not to wear ""feminine"" clothes, and I can't believe you dont realize how much of that is a superficial and privileged view. I don't fucking care about having support about not shaving, I care about being able to wear clothes that won't land me a heatstroke and not being leered at or even harrassed, I care about not being asked I have children in my job interviews, I care about women not being able to have a goddamn abortion in my fucking third world country without risking jail time or dying in one of those clandestine clinics, I care about not being afraid of going out after dark because the most that can happen to me isn't simply having my phone and wallet robbed, I care about not having to think I can't be sitting in an aisle seat when I take the bus because some dude may want to rub on me, I care about not having to deal with dudes that can't understand I just want to play a game without being hit on or hearing my place is in the kitchen after being repeatedly turned down, I care about my fucking president saying that he had a daughter after a bunch of sons because he had a moment of weakness, I care about not having to constantly have my earphones on when I'm out so dudes will leave me the fuck alone. I could keep going, but I want to be clear I don't fucking care about shaving."
4381,,"i dont have the energy to reply to most of what you said but i will say this: i am sick and tired of trans rights activists using women who no longer hace uteruses to say ‚Äúwell she doesnt have a uterus so she‚Äôs not a woman either.‚Äù 

what an awful, ignorant and disgusting counterpoint.

a woman who has to undergo a hysterectomy and lose her uterus is still 100% a woman, because that surgical experience and its aftermath is 100% tied to her womanhood. my aunt had a hysterectomy last week after suffering for decades with endometriosis. she was never able to have children and everytime she got her period‚Äîwhich TiMs also claim to have just cuz HRT gives them cramps lol; that, or they fetishize it‚Äîshe would experience excruciating pain and an extremely heavy blood flow, so debilitating she couldnt leave her home. do you know how many women suffer from endometriosis? 1 in 10. they might be infertile. they might have to have their uterus or ovaries removed, but they are still women, because those are real women‚Äôs issues. they are not menstruators or uterus-havers‚Äîthey are WOMEN. 

i know TiMs don‚Äôt see older women as real women but those are women too. my mother in law had to get a mastectomy after breast cancer diagnosis. my mom is going through menopause right now, which comes w horrifying symptoms. they are still women. those are women‚Äôs issues. you would not understand."

4384,strawlesbian,"And on the left we have Exhibit B, anti-feminist reddit user outright lying to justify hatred for feminists whose viewpoints are inconvenient."
4385,pixiebiz,"TERF was coined by libfem/funfem TigTog, a male kowtowing blogger, specifically as a slur against radical feminists.  Its original use was as a way to pigeonhole and demonize women who prioritized female liberation and the fight against male supremacy and refused to get on our knees for males and chanting the holy catachisms ""Transwomen are Women"" and ""Feminism is for Everybody"".  It was then popularized by such internet Trans Luminaries as Char the Butcher (an actual self professed Nazi, also originator of ""Die Cis Scum""), Gender Bitch (Infamous for blogging about torturing a black radfem with acid, among MANY other women hating fantasies), Jos Triutt (who took over as editor of feministing and immediately began to purge women who stuck up for the rights of actual female humans), and of course the lovely Julia Serano who thinks that reproductive sovereignty focused feminism is transphobic because he feels it is ""alienating"" to him as an ""infertile woman"".  So no it was not coined by radical feminists, TERF has always been a term used against us by misogynists who hate the fact that there are women who are willing to name the problem of male violence and refuse to shut up about it.  Mary Mother of Kittens, the level of historical revisionism you fuckers propagate is as bad as the most craven of the patriarchal religions.  Take your lies elsewhere dick worshipper."
4386,dulead,"I mean yeah I paraphrased a book I read a few years ago, by reviewing the Wikipedia page. But that doesnt take away what the philosophy she posisted, I'm happy you reviewed it; doesn't sound like you ""read exactly what she said"" though :p 
I used shaving as an example :< I was just trying to say women shouldn't have to do something unless she choices to. Not the end all be all of womenhood is about shaving or something  :/"

4389,MagikalWords,"I haven't read it, I own up to it instead of bringing up dumbed down arguments from wikipedia without a proper way to validate them. I don't think you meant shaving is a symbol of womanhood or anything, but your view of feminism is shallow if these are the issues you feel compelled to mention when talking about what means to be a woman."
4390,strawlesbian,"Radical feminists are feminists. I understand that you hate feminists, it's ok, really! Most people do. Please stop lying though, really not a good look right next to all the anti-feminism."
