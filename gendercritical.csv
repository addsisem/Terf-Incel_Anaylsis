@jk\_rowling Thank you for saying this. WE LOVE YOU ‚ö°Ô∏è [twitter](https://twitter.com/rGenderCritical/status/1208084151573725184)"
1,"Christ... the kind of shit people are replying you'd think she'd murdered an entire nursery of disabled kids or something.

It's twitter though, so no real surprise it's full of absolute clowns.

Apparently it's now *""cruel and primitive""* to understand that sex exists... Who the fuck are these people? How do they manage to function in the real world?"
2,"The replies to the tweet are just incredible. All she said was don't fire a woman for saying biological sex is a thing, and people are saying that trans kids wouldn't be allowed in Hogwarts and that Rowling is a literal Death Eater üòÇ"
3,"The fact that she put the hashtag #ThisIsNotADrill indicates she knows perfectly well what she is doing. ""This is Not a Drill"" is the title of an article, mentioned in another post in this sub, written by Kathleen Stock and subtitled ""I call upon UK academic philosophers and other academics to publicly demonstrate their disciplinary values."" Kathleen Stock is mentioned in Julie Bindel's recent article, ""Triumph of the Trans Lobbyists.""

I wonder if anyone else if putting up any #ThisIsNotADrill tweets."
4,"Digg.com's article on the issue said that J.K. Rowling is wrong because ""trans people have a right to exist"". Jesus fuck. Any time some random person doesn't give them what they want, it gets blown into some massive human tragedy on par with the worst violations of the right to live. 

NO ONE SAID TIP DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO EXIST. Fuck. Not buying into your ideology =/= believing you don't have the right to exist. 

It's like having someone refuse to convert to your religion and claiming that they want you dead because of it."
5,"I still can't believe a CHARITY WORKER was fired. 

People in the biological, medical sciences say things like ""sex is immutable"" every single day. 

If I wasn't on this sub I don't think I would understand the level of pushback a statement like this would cause."
6,"This is fantastic! This must be difficult for her as she'll undoubtedly attract a lot of venom from some of her own supporters. Like Dumbledore says: ""It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.‚Äù"
7,"As much as I love this, the replies are so bizarre. Guilt-tripping someone for acknowledging reality. I hope she doesn‚Äôt cave in and apologize to the TRA circlejerk."
8,"SEX IS REAL.

What the actual fuck is going on when you're ""violating human rights"" by stating an objective scientific fact?"
9,"Ok today is the day. I've fucking peaked. Reading through the comments to her tweet has well and truly stuck the knife in. All my life I have suffered because I am female. I don't ""feel"" any way in particular, I *am* female. And I have suffered for it. From being raped at 7 to being abused by my ex boyfriend and everything in between. Now we are being told these experiences are imaginary and to suggest that our experiences are because of our BIOLOGICAL SEX is fucking transphobic!  I just can't anymore. This is insane, I am done."
10,Now THAT is a brave and stunning woman.
11,"I'm not surprised! She might be filthy rich now but once upon a time she was the kind of woman who spent time in women's shelters. I speak from experience when I say middle class privilege makes it easy to chant transwomen are women because it doesn't even occur to ask questions like ""what if I was at a homeless shelter and my roommate was the Gamestop Ma'am? What if I were in prison and had to share a shower with Kate White?"""
12,"People are losing their damn minds in the replies. They love posting that photo of Emma Watson wearing the ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äùshirt, as if JKR is advocating for the hunt of trans people for sport."
13,"I‚Äôm shook right now. I feel like I will never have the professional and personal security to be so bold.
Seeing JK be brave enough to STAND UP is amazing to me. HP was a big part of my childhood and family life."
14,A few months ago several of my acquaintances went to local libraries and hid Rowling's books so patrons couldn't find them.   At least two refused to let their children read Harry Potter because they consider her a TERF.
15,"So surprising (/s) how such a sound, non aggressive statement is met with loads of memes saying ""shut the fuck up terf"" with cutesy guns being pointed from the side shouting about being on ""the right side of history""."
16,"Oh thank goodness. Well done JK. We need someone with her profile to stand up for women.

The replies and indirects about her tweet is absolutely INSANE.... all this whining and crying about ‚Äúhow will the trans kids feel seeing this‚Äù and all this... what?? Nobody should be so fragile and deluded that they cry at the MATERIAL REALITY that biological sex is a real thing. Like other commenters have said, people are making it seem as if she is some sort of mass murderer for acknowledging a basic fact that EVERYONE ACCEPTED up until recently."
17,YES!!!  So glad a celebrity had the balls to stand up and SAY SOMETHING!!!
18,"Oh damn, JK went IN!"
19,"Thank you, J.K."
20,"FANTASTIC NEWS!!

And this is why I love when poor women end up super rich but don't forget about their sisters- she is still in touch with her struggles as a single mother and the other underdogs thrown under the bus

Also writing fantasy novels for a living she probs has a lot to say about that LOLLLL

Glad JK was able to see the growing gravitas of this issue. This is actually huge given her level of fame!! Seems like she was flirting with it in the background but has now decided to go full throttle GC!!!"
21,"I find it deeply disturbing that merely saying ""sex  is real"" is now front page news. I genuinely feel like I'm going crazy reading the responding tweets, like I've stepped into a parallel universe."
22,Oof. According to some of the comments this post is rising in /r/all. Prepare for the TRAs
23,The comments under her tweet are a living proof that many transgenderpeople unfortunately have severe mental health issue. The way they are losing it is more than creepy and the way they threaten women for their agenda disgusting. Everybody supporting them supports a new form of misogyny. Plain and simple.
24,Yes!!!! I love to hear celebrities pushing back.
25,The idiot trans loons who trashed her from a Like on a tweet caused their own issues. The more they screech and whine and ban and censor the more people push back. Of course she was going to be a terf. This is what happens when you are metaphorically and literally bullied by men. You push back.
26,The man who started all this with Maya referred to a feminist charity group as ‚Äúroasties‚Äù and said he hoped they got raped. Incel language.
27,"Rowling didn‚Äôt even mention gender ideology, and the TRAs are losing their shit.  She only mentioned that biological sex is real. How can ANYONE with a functioning brain stem argue with that? The fact they are frothing at the mouth at a statement of objective true just shows how crazy this movement has become."
28,Is woke twitter going to start comparing her to Voldemort now?
29,"This court ruling has emboldened cyclopath.  He is talking lawsuits and is wanting to contact major news publications.   

He really thinks he can sue every woman into shutting up, but will more likely begin a campaign of contacting employers of every woman who speaks out.   I have nothing to lose to this bully, but I fear for women in the U.K.

I can read his twitter account from my phone only (which I find difficult), since I'm been blocked on my computer.  :)"
30,"Came to this sub to see if anyone was talking about this! I saw ‚ÄúJK Rowling is a terf‚Äù trending and thought, ‚ÄúGood for her. I like her more now.‚Äù"
31,"""Cool."" - Magdalen Berns"
32,Watch them burn their Harry Potter books.
33,The replies to her tweet are all people claiming to be in tears and heartbroken. I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine being that affected by someone‚Äôs words.
34,"I read the tweet and my first thought was, she‚Äôs not saying anything wrong. She‚Äôs acknowledging reality. The people angry about her comment are so deep in denial. I don‚Äôt get it."
35,[deleted]
36,"So wonderful that JK is brave enough to stand up for common sense and women‚Äôs rights. A large number of her fans are crying about it. Looks like they still believe in fantasies.

Maya F is crowdfunding her legal fees. Unfortunately she has only hit ¬£85,000 so far. It‚Äôs against rules to link it but please please donate if you are able to."
37,"I cannot believe saying ""sex is real"" is such a massive issue. Also how is it even transphobic whatsoever? Even trans people fucking know they have a biological sex. This is all so ridiculous lol."
38,[deleted]
39,"Just some minutes later you'll see hundreds of raging lib HP fans dissowning JK and talking trash about their fav franchise.
Maybe now they'll read another book"
40,Goddess bless her.
41,"I‚Äôm so amazed. I wish she‚Äôd know that despite all of the people who throw this to the erroneous extreme of, ‚ÄúShe hates trans people‚Äù and attack her accordingly, there are women out there like me who read that from such a distinguished person and felt that they could breathe a little more easily. I had really believed that no person of her caliber would ever do this‚Äî hell, I had even doubted that any were out there who didn‚Äôt buy in to the fantasy. Anyone who accuses her of hateful bigotry is living in their fragile imagination. She‚Äôs not calling for trans abuse in any way. She is simply speaking up for what she knows as true regarding justice and reality. 

People often tell the story of how she started Harry Potter, and I see that same determined woman in this tweet. Congratulations to J.K Rowling for living with integrity."
42,the like ratio is also really encouraging! way more likes than any of her recent tweets!!
43,Women continue to suffer while men don't. This is not fair and it is not right.
44,"BEAUTIFUL. Thank you JK! I've always felt a little honoured to have a signed copy of The Goblet of Fire from her but now it's extra special ngl. 

I take back everything I said about the Crimes of Grindlewald being kinda bad. (But not the Cursed Child. I stand by my review of 'pretty show, not nearly as good as the actual books')"
45,"Holy shit I hope JK Tweets about the Scottish GRA reform consultation. The fucking bastards have been trying to sneak it in below the radar like they always do. Coincidentally Wings over Scotland, the biggest Scottish GC Twitter account and the one with the widest reach, got banned the day they announced the consultation."
46,Just got called a terf today over in Twitter for applauding her. üòè
47,"maybe shes sick of literal hundreds of creeps arguing about 'girldick' in every fucking tweet she makes

it would bother me less if there werent actual tweets from children sandwiched between these fucking girldick tweets

god bless you jkr"
48,"The only negative consequence of this are the liberal think pieces that are going to flood youtube on why JK Rowling is cancelled and how ‚Äúwrong‚Äù she is. üòÇ

_All_ the people I follow who usually stick to pop culture and avoid politics, are going to have something to say about this. I‚Äôm tired already."
49,finally
50,Holy shit TRA heads will explode.
51,I think I‚Äôll go out and buy the entire Harry Potter set just for this üòÜ.  Yessss!
52,Hurrah!! I was so miserable this morning - the court ruling was outrageous. I now feel galvanised. Speaking out always makes a difference.
53,"She‚Äôs in a unique position in that she‚Äôs made her fortune and success and is no longer reliant on public opinion. We all know she‚Äôs had these opinions for a while but I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs finally being open and bold about it. The TRAs can cry and complain if they want, and call for a boycott of one of the world‚Äôs biggest and most beloved franchises, and it won‚Äôt make the slightest bit of difference."
54,"If you listen closely, you can hear thousands peaking at once"
55,"Really appreciate when influential people, especially women stand up to this bullshit. Maybe she can have a word with Emma Watson.

The replies are both sad and comical at the same time.

Edit: remember the outrage over a tweet she liked? She knew she was gonna catch hate for this but did it anyway. Good for her."
56,[deleted]
57,"Shout out to JK Rowling for taking a stand because this shit has been getting ridiculous. They're enraged and it's currently trending on Twitter. They even have ""JK Rowling is a TERF"" trending. LOL"
58,"Such a big deal. I have been trying to battle commenters on that post by explaining what the T-word means, who uses it, why the case was important, why it was so disappointing, why it's outrageous she lost her job, how sex cant change. 

The basics really. Same as in real life, gently gently explaining to people why this is harmful to women. 

If you arent already, would any of you mind joining in on Twitter and helping us look as reasonable as we are? The TRA's are out in force. Unfortunately for them, they've come out with the gun memes and manga characters and look, frankly, ridiculous."
59,T\*RF is trending now on Twitter üôÑ
60,"Good for her. The replies to her tweet are so pathetic, I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre at a point in time where stating basic facts about biology can get you crucified. Ridiculous."
61,She said how I feel exactly! I don't care if men want to dress like women or even call them women as long as they are not legally recognized as women and i don't get thrown in jail for calling them a man
62,Why is it wrong to understand there is a biological sex? People are completely overreacting. I see a lot of Harry Potter tattoo coverups in the near future.
63,The number of people apparently reduced to a puddle of tears over this - a statement of biological fact and reality - makes me laugh.
64,"Apparently Mark Hamill liked the tweet. I suspect a lot more prominent figures share the same views but don‚Äôt want to deal with the Twitter circus and ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù. Twitter really thinks they are the majority opinion because they start trending topics and try to cancel everyone when it‚Äôs really propelled by teenagers and college age kids trying to be woke and regurgitating they same mantras, such as‚Äùtranswomen are women‚Äù, without a clue of what they‚Äôre talking about . They can‚Äôt even define woman without circular logic or sexist stereotypes"
65,She is wonderful and knows actual kindness‚Äî not TRA-‚Äòkindness‚Äô threatened into her. We need more people like her standing up for women.
66,This is almost too good to be true!
67,"They're gonna try and cancel her in every way possible.

Too bad cancel culture doesn't exist. I can think of very few people who have been ""cancelled"" on Twitter and had anly longterm negative impact on their career. All she has to do is not address it."
68,I‚Äôm so glad
69,"Never read the Harry Potter books, because i was too old when they came out, but i'm all in. I'm teaching philosophy, so maybe i can work her into on my syllabus. Great news!"
70,"Well! Excuse me, while I cheer (silently at work)! üòç 

I'll remember this, when the famous skeptic dudebros come along and appropriate the resistance against TRA. The cowards."
71,"Good for her. I know she's super rich and all, but it takes guts nowadays to speak common sense. She didn't say anything particularly controversial, yet we all know how simply acknowledging biological sex as a reality is considered ""transphobic.""

I enjoyed the Harry Potter books when I was a kid, but I never stuck around too long in the fandom. Every big fandom has its overzealous fans; the petty side of me wonders how libfem HP fans will handle this. Judging by the responses on Twitter, I'm sure they'll be oh so calm and open-minded, unlike evil transphobic JK Rowling...

Seriously though, I can't believe we live in a world where ""sex is real"" needs to be said and is considered offensive. I'm glad someone greatly influential like JK Rowling is speaking out.

Edit: I looked up more responses on Twitter and Tumblr, and I can't feel a smidgen of gleeful pettiness like I thought I could. The viciousness and heartbreak many people are showing is exhausting. Rowling said nothing hateful or prejudiced, yet people are treating her as if she's a supervillain on the levels of Voldemort."
72,"Good for her. Never been a Harry Potter fan, but that may have to change."
73,"Some idols never let you down.. 

This is absolutely wonderful! And she was so classy about it, too."
74,"Where's that David Tennant 10th Doctor 'GOOD OL' J.K.!!!!!!' gif????

(Also, presumably, The Tenth Doctor knew about all this, considering he's a Time Lord and all. The Doctor is a TERF, confirmed.)

I think I might wear my Gryffindor scarf today in solidarity."
75,"I hope she stands her fucking ground.

One look at the replies and I wanna gag, I hate these people so fucking much. I'm not a rad fem so I find it ironic they call anyone a terf simply because we hate their bullshit.

I doubt JK is even a TERF, she's just peak trans and I'm glad she had the balls to speak her mind.

\#IStandwithJKR"
76,Finally. Saw this coming from all of her rabid genderkweer fans annoying her constantly. She was gonna crack eventually.
77,"Pleasantly surprised at the amount of support in the comments, even if it is intermittently placed in between memes that are LITERALLY calls to violence against ""t\*rfs"""
78,"I've liked her tweet. That doesn't seem at all like a big deal but I'm becoming less afraid. Especially considering women (and some men like @glinner but let's face it mostly women) are actually paying with their livelihoods for stating the truth. It's the least I can do.

Edit: a number of people I know and follow have called J.K. Rowling an ""evil terf"" or something to that effect, saying they stand by ""those she has hurt with her transphobia""... And these are otherwise intelligent seeming people. I've not uttered a word of my own on the matter but I can't help feeling like I need to brace myself for some backlash soon."
79,"I picture her reading the responses, laughing, surrounded by piles of money. I love it."
80,"I feel so sorry for Maya that she is having to go through all of this, from her writing she seems to have a very clever and smart point of view about international tax policy, its a pity she isn't still in the job she loved but at the same time I am enjoying the sun shining through the overton window now that people are now discussing how batshit this all is."
81,"I‚Äôve been a Harry Potter fan since I was 8, and I thought that I couldn‚Äôt love her more. She has officially proven me wrong! I‚Äôm so glad that she‚Äôs using her massive platform to say what the rest of us are thinking."
82,I was SO HAPPY when I saw this on Twitter earlier today. This is a big deal.
83,Well done Rowling! Looks like my country is leading the way in resisting this trans bullshit.
84,I'm proud of her.
85,Yes!!! Queen Rowling. It is so valuable to have people in her position who cannot be silenced by firing or intimidation to speak out on behalf of women. I‚Äôm so happy she‚Äôs done this
86,Things like these shows the true qualities of the trans movement. Ignorance and rudeness.
87,Well done Joanne! The TRAs are going crazy and showing their true nature to an even wider audience now!
88,Fuck yes! Ily JK Rowling! Come visit us at this sub :)
89,What a fucking queen. Unironically.
90,My favorite part is the trans activists comparing her to characters from her own book
91,"I'm so glad she finally came out of the Gender Critical closet officially. We need women like Rowling in our corner because not only is she a beloved figure, she's so rich that she doesn't have to worry about her income being slashed or becoming financially destitute as a result of being ""cancelled"". So she can say things that many other women WANT to say but can't because they can't afford to lose their careers and reputations.

&#x200B;

TRAs can call her ""Hitler"" and ""TERF"" all they like. She'll still be collecting those sweet Harry Potter royalty checks!"
92,"""Joanne Andrea,""¬†I said quietly, ""you were named for two censored feminists. One of them was called a TERF and she was probably¬†the bravest woman I ever knew."""
93,"Hilariously, I remember back in the early 2000s when it was the religious right who were banning Harry Potter books for being full of the devil's work. Now the Left have met them on the other side of the horseshoe and are banning the books too!"
94,"Original tweet was awesome and she clearly knows what shes doing! If I didnt work in games and animation I'd retweet with a million confetti horn emojis! Really depressing to see my entire timeline filled with people I look up to in my field or consider intelligent equals saying ""if you're a terf you can go die"" and just repeating ""trans rights are human rights"" 

No they're fucking not frankly, they're exceptional not standard. Human rights (for women,for minority groups, for disabled people) are rights and protections you CANT CHANGE. If you change your mind on your gender WELL LOOK AT THAT YOU CHANGED AND IT MEANS ITS SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY THAT ISNT IMMUTABLE. That makes any request for those rights or protections exceptional, a luxury,NOT a requirement"
95,"A beautiful peak trans end to a decade of madness.   
Hi r/all please read links in the sidebar and also visit r/itsafetish or r/actuallynotlesbians for more great content."
96,"> Trans folks have an extraordinary high suicide rate... can we just let them have the identity they want please? They're not doing anyone any harm. Leave them alone. 

Some of these people are so full of shit it's coming out of their ears. The fact that mentally ill men kill themselves is not our problem. Why the fucking hell should all the women of the world have to agree that a woman is a identity for a mentally ill man to have? 

As for not doing any harm that's a laugh. This woman is being fired for stating they're not women. Rowling is being called horrible names for standing at her side. How about they leave us alone?"
97,I am so happy and just came here to say I love all women of Gender Critical and especially the mods and veterans for doing the hard work for years!!!! You absolute stars!
98,"Honestly, seeing what feels like the entire female nerd establishment coming for Rowling‚Äôs neck makes me feel so hopeless. It‚Äôs so hard to be reminded that women that I once felt so much kinship with are caught up in this misogynist ideology almost to a fault. I saw Siobhan Thomas tweet that Rowling was a bitch who should retire, and it just broke my heart. Mara Wilson, Noelle Stevenson, Kate Beaton... I know that these women are libfems, they have to be to get anywhere in the nerd establishment, but it‚Äôs still disheartening to be reminded of how intolerant and extremist the whole scene has become. Or maybe it always was? I think I finally understand what the gamergaters meant when they said they wanted politics out of nerd media (even if I otherwise think they were a bunch of fools).  

I am so glad Christmas is happening and I at least won‚Äôt be seeing my irl nerd friends until this has hopefully calmed down a bit, because I‚Äôm sure they would talk about it and I just can‚Äôt deal with that. I just want to agree to disagree and move on to talking about Godzilla."
99,"I was raised to think that accusations of thoughtcrime, crimethink, and wrongthink were worse than the blasphemy they sought to punish. FYI I am a man (adult human male) - and suspect that we both read, interpret and take lessons from Orwell in exactly the same way. 

That was a very scary judgment.....and the decision, to use a legal term - seems ‚Äòperverse‚Äô indeed."
100,"From the BBC article:

>""It is a core component of her belief that she will refer to a person  by the sex she considered appropriate even if it violates their dignity  and/or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or  offensive environment,"" he continued.  
>  
>""The approach is not worthy of respect in a democratic society.""

So, calling things as you see them is not allowed in a democratic society? Have we no freedom to think as individuals anymore? What makes such a society *democratic,* then?"
101,"People are acting like she said transpeople don't deserve rights or respect. She literally just said that a woman should not lose her job for acknowledging biological sex. You can't change it. Maybe one day that technology will exist, but it doesn't currently. That's like someone saying ""believe what you want, but don't fire someone for saying the earth isn't flat"" and it causing huge outrage. Hard sciences exist and we shouldn't cover our ears and act like theory is more viable. 

She probably knew there'd be a lot of backlash and posted the tweet anyways. Proud of her."
102,Someone rich and famous finally stood up for women! JK Rowling if you read this board... I LOVE YOU!
103,"I loved *Harry Potter* so much as a kid and adolescent (and I still have a lot of nostalgia for it now), and JK hasn't let me down üòä"
104,I'm so proud of her
105,GOOD FOR HER!!!!!!!!!!
106,The Twitter mob tantrums are so damn funny. Can't wait to piss off the woke crowd just by being a HP character for Halloween next year.
107,"The amount of people losing their shit over someone saying bio sex is real is.....wow. I honestly can't believe this is reality. 

Also reading everything going down on twitter, the cult like aspects of transgender ideology are really apparent."
108,"My male friend tweeted in support of Maya. A few TRAs attacked him, contacted his employer & he got fired today."
109,"Jameela Jamil grows more irritating by the day:

https://i.postimg.cc/dt1jKyms/CF304-E97-0-F25-4335-9748-36783-FF4963-F.jpg

Tying herself in knots trying to be everything to everyone."
110,She has fuck you money and gives no shits. This is brilliant heh
111,"I read some tweets, and one of them is like, I grew up reading your books and loved Harry Potter. What have I done to you? Why do you hate me and people like me?

Who the fuck said she hates you? You're just not a woman. FFS.

I knew what it would be like, but the pile on she's experiencing now is just incredible.

Thankfully, she has lots of money and I don't think she gives a fuck."
112,Prepare for a total fucking meltdown. I love it. You fucking go Jo!!
113,"I really fucking love this woman more and more everyday. Let me get my coins together and go buy the Harry Potter box set for people for Christmas, brb."
114,fucking incredible. just saw the tweet. followed
115,"The hysterical responses to her tweet are so insane: ""Your books showed me that anyone could be a hero if they were treated with respect and love; today, you betrayed me and destroyed my childhood!"""
116,I love JKR. Loved her always!
117,"I love her even more now. And the abuse being hurled at her from TIMs and handmaidens is just strengthening her resolve. Really, the TPAs do the work for us."
118,I wish we could all pull a Harry Potter weekend as an act of celebration üéâ
119,"Yaaaaaasssss!  She's one of us!

  
That said, I figured JK was GC, but the Maya Forstater situation must have peaked her enough to actually come out with it."
120,"I get more and more radical feminist as a pushback to all this shit. I have no problem at all with transgender and fully support them IN THEIR OWN SPACES.
But we women are constantly being asked to make room for those who did not grow up female and who make everything into uterus-havers and pregnant people.
They deserve to have their own space. Women deserve our own space, free of being shut up and shut out by biological men."
121,AWWWWWYIIIIISSSSSSS
122,Go you good thing!! Imagine being one of the cabbages who think this makes her a bad person?!
123,"One thing that‚Äôs fascinating is watching people not involved in these ideologies tip-toe around the drama. 

So many people being like ‚Äú*obviously* this isn‚Äôt about saying you can change your sex. *Obviously* you can‚Äôt *actually* change your sex. This is about gender and *identity*.‚Äú 

These people about be cancelled and they won‚Äôt know what hit them. 

People jumping on the hate bandwagon, because they assume the backlash has to be something more than just ‚Äúmales cannot become females *literally*‚Äù."
124,"In Scotland the number 3 trending hashtag is ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äù, number 5 being ‚ÄúI Stand With Maya Forstater‚Äù.

So twitter is at war of trans folk losing their shit and shouting ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äù, gender critical folk pointing out ‚Äúbut women‚Äôs rights aren‚Äôt trans rights‚Äù, lots of threats towards Rowling, lots of folk speaking out in favour of Rowling including gender critical Scottish MP Joan McAlpine and Blair White, and several trans folk supporting Rowling as well (sadly being drowned out), basically a bit of a war zone.

Vast majority of Scottish folk I‚Äôve seen online support what Rowling has said.

Maya Lost her job for being gender critical, and folk are trying to claim she was horrible etc, but she was calm, makes sense, is defending women‚Äôs rights, and trans folk are screaming over the top of everyone, including Amnesty International, 


[her judgment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12P9zf82TicPs2cCxlTnm0TrNFDD8Gaz5/view) (google drive link, has a PDF of all the legal papers)"
125,Fuck yes!
126,"Posting this from another sub because apparently actual biological facts are also offensive now and I was instantly banned for it (though I guess I'm not surprised since it was on a sub called ""TRRRRAAAANNNNSSSSS"", but seriously and honestly can someone actually explain where I'm wrong here with actual logic?

>Why should she even apologize? What she said was 100% fact. Lopping off your manhood or attaching one to yourself doesn't magically change your DNA. You still have the same XX or XY chromosomes and are still biologically whatever gender you were born as.

>Regardless of what anyone believes, if a trans woman who was a man leaves behind blood at a crime scene, and that blood is tested, the police will be looking for a male, simple as that. No amount of surgery is going to change that."
127,Good for her. She's seeing the truth and not afraid to speak up.
128,"Very proud of JK Rowling for taking what should be considered a normal stance but in today‚Äôs world, is controversial. The crazies can keep crying on Twitter. There are more people that support her than dont."
129,I would just like to toss in my two cents and say that sex is obviously real and the controversy is silly. OK bye.
130,"This is great since they‚Äôre typically all obsessed with Harry Potter (well, second next to anime) and having to be reminded by having their rooms in their parents house decked in HP stuff (I think there‚Äôs a correlation between trying to live in a fantasy world and many of the T) that not everyone agrees with their BS is good. It‚Äôs also interesting given the old arguments that sex and gender are different and Maya had just said that men can‚Äôt change their SEX nothing even gender related and they‚Äôre losing their minds ü§£"
131,Influx of new peak trans posts from this event in 3...2...1...
132,I've had a silly grin on my face all day. This is wonderful! So many people will peak because of this and at the end of the day you can't change reality! Biology is real my dudes!
133,I wonder if she‚Äôll keep doing this - maybe make a vaguely gc tweet every couple of weeks and watch everyone lose their shit. I‚Äôd have fun with that
134,Damn straight.
135,Ahahahahahha wooo! Go JK!
136,Woohoo! No more Hogwarts stripey socks!!
137,JK Rowling is powerful. She used her influence to speak out against injustice and she is unafraid of the backlash. Good for her.
138,"I love her. Honestly, I wonder if her recent turn towards politics and increasingly controversial and radical stances is in any way a reaction to getting fucked over by Brexit, after advocating for union on indyref1. Maybe she took it as a wakeup call that ""politics as usual"" isn't so usual anymore."
139,Good for her!
140,"
HELL YES"
141,Who else thinks Jo lurks this sub?
142,I‚Äôm wearing my HP T-shirt with pride today.
143,I love JK even more now
144,Oh lawd she serious
145,I‚Äôm so happy! What a brilliant woman!
146,Wow I always thought she was an annoying libfem. Very glad to hear that a woman as famous as she is actually a radfem. Or at least a gender critical fem.
147,"This is the woman who wrote Harry Potter. Has it seriously not occurred to any of them that maybe she has a point? 

Side note, I'm really happy she did this. I grew up obsessed with Harry Potter and this proves she stands by her morals, not running and hiding from bullies."
148,"Woohoo! If you have a twitter, remember to go over there and write a message of support! I made one just to do that...and I'll delete it tomorrow."
149,This tweet makes me so damn happy y'all. So happy.
150,How are people mad about a basic fact?  No man will ever have a baby.  Noman will ever become a what man.
151,What great news to wake up to.
152,JK Rowling isn't perfect but she stands up for what she believes in despite the people who will demonize her. And that is what makes her great.
153,"I would just like to remind people that the first reply to Rowling's tweet, Eugene Gu, is a narcissistic, abusive prick. Welcome to politics in 2019."
154,üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
155,I was also glad to hear it
156,Good for her! Happy to support both of these amazing women.
157,Wow nearly 400 comments!
158,"""""""""woke progressives"""""""""": gender and sex are different!!!!

also """"""""""woke progressives"""""""""""""": gender and sex are the same, I can be whatever I want!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111"
159,"I forgive her for the whole ""wizards shit in their pants"" thing."
160,Finally grew a spine. Proud of her.
161,"Is it really about whether sex is real or not? I thought the whole point of trans is that sex is different from gender. That you can be any gender, regardless of what your sex is...? So what's the problem with this?"
162,Good on her.
163,lol maybe i'll read harry potter now
164,"I feel like everyone knew she felt this way, but Im glad she‚Äôs finally being honest and direct."
165,Based Rowling
166,"I‚Äôm so proud of her! THIS is stunning and brave! 

I tried not to read the replies because I don‚Äôt want to raise my blood pressure but it‚Äôs ‚Äúfunny‚Äù how they can act morally superior and tell a woman to ‚Äúsuck my dick‚Äù in the same breath.  I also wonder how many times Tumblr exploded today. It seems like these people are overly invested in Harry Potter."
167,"I was so happy to see this tweet. It pretty much embodies my reaction to reading about the decision and how I feel in general. 

I don't understand how there are people saying that she's being a transphobe, though. And confusing gender with sex. And saying she's standing with ""people who hate them"". All because she doesn't support someone losing her job because the person stated that sex is real."
168,I came here from sorting by rising on r/all. I don't understand what all this is. Can someone explain?
169,Yay! Good on her.

171,"And the fact that every SINGLE Western media outlet has like 10 stories specifically about this.... a TWEET!! And most of them have an obviously biased tone of condemnation against Rowling. 

Yet when you have stories like kids trying to de-transition, or parents losing custody of kids because they don't agree with genital mutilation... silence. Not a goddamn single story about any of that stuff in the centrist/leftwing media and we are forced to go on right wing sites or foreign sites to even find out about it."
172,"One of the replies in the Twitter thread really gets me.

""That's a straw man of a complex argument, and as such more divisive than useful.  Trans folks have an extraordinary high suicide rate... can we just let them have the identity they want please? They're not doing anyone any harm. Leave them alone.""

&#x200B;

Translation: Give them what they want so they don't kill themselves.

&#x200B;

Isn't threatening suicide to get what you want textbook manipulation?"
173,"Her twitter thread has a positively all-star cast. Wife beater and failed doctor Eugene Gu, creepy male feminist Charles ""Charlotte"" Clymer, the straight woman 'lesbian' Amanda Knox, doughy TIM Avery Edison, and so much more. So many unique people from different walks of life, all coming together to have a public meltdown because J.K. Rowling knows that sex is real and immutable."
174,BuT SE x iSn'T bLACk anD WhiTe anD mEn Can hAVe xx and FemALEs caN HAVE XXyyZ and the BRAIN IS BIOLOGICAL AHHHHHHHHHHHH
175,">Who the fuck are these people? How do they manage to function in the real world?

They don't."
176,">Christ... the kind of shit people are replying you'd think she'd murdered an entire nursery of disabled kids or something.

In their view she did something far worse.

She failed to validate some people."
177,"We can couch our explanations in as gentle terms as is possible, and TRAs will still scream at us for being violent transphobes who want them dead."
178,"My favourite bat shit crazy tweet was: ""she's been a bigot for a while, you can see it in her books. The goblins at Gringott's bank are clearly just an anti semitic trope."" I'm absolutely loving people raking through children's books published years ago to find evidence that the author is evil."
179,"I‚Äôm shocked at the number of people who are acting like she‚Äôs retrospectively destroyed their childhood. I grew up reading the Alex Rider and Diamond Brother Series by Anthony Horowitz. They‚Äôre still my favourite teen books today, even though Horowitz has made some questionable remarks about having a black James Bond. I can separate his personal politics from his books, and I‚Äôll never forget how excited I would get when his latest release was available in my local library. They have the mind of a child, honestly."
180,Trans kids WOULDN‚ÄôT be allowed at Hogwarts. The stairs to the girls‚Äô dorms turn into slides if boys try to use them.
181,I _adore_ Kathleen Stock and am an avid follower of her works. The fact that Rowling used her hashtag was the most exciting part for me!
182,Oh that‚Äôs awesome! I didn‚Äôt catch that. I <3 Stock.
183,It's my favorite non sequitur: stating that men cannot become women or vice versa means that you're literally denying the existence of trans people.
184,"> It's like having someone refuse to convert to your religion and claiming that they want you dead because of it. 

*""I don't believe that Jesus Christ is my personal Lord and Savior. But I support your right to believe it.""*

*""OMG STOP HOLOCAUSTING THE CHRISTIANS YOU GENOCIDAL MANIAC!!!!""*

&#x200B;

At this point, I don't understand how anyone can see the mainstream transgender/queer movement as anything other than a fanatical religious cult."
185,">It's like having someone refuse to convert to your religion and claiming that they want you dead because of it.

That's exactly what it is. It's not enough to say people have the right to their faith, and everyone should live in peace and security. You have to 100% believe the TWAW dogma, or at least pretend to. Or else you're a dangereous bigot."
186,"I‚Äôm currently trying to decide what I find more ridiculous: 

This reaction...or Republicans comparing the impeachment proceedings against Trump with Jesus being nailed to the cross.

I think we have a tie."
187,She didn't even openly oppose their ideology. She just said that opposing their ideology shouldn't be a reason to fire someone.
188,"I'm seeing people *literally*, without exaggeration compare Rowling's tweet to the KKK. And no, they aren't trolls. You can't make this shit up."
189,These grown ass people legitimately struggle with object permanence
190,">It's like having someone refuse to convert to your religion and claiming that they want you dead because of it.

perfect!"
191,"""Charity"" in the British sense, i.e. non-profit. Her job was to research tax evasion."
192,A whole lot of people would rather disengage from this crap if they have the means and she probably made the decision to fight it back hard as she can and bail if young people are this stupid.
193,"Idk, I feel like it‚Äôs been popular to hate on JKR as a show of wokeness for a while now. I don‚Äôt think anyone who wasn‚Äôt already on board the JKR Sucks train is going to care much. Her statement was completely reasonable to anyone who hasn‚Äôt drunk the TRA flavoraid. If anything, I think the vitriol fired at her for such a benign statement will show people how insidious trans ideology is."
194,She‚Äôs taking a leaf out of Harry Potter‚Äôs book
195,"I think Rowling knew the reaction she would get, based off previous posts she‚Äôs made. I don‚Äôt think she would have said anytbing at all if she was going to backtrack later."
196,"Rowling isn't even saying that *she* disagrees with the TRAs: she's literally just saying that she thinks people should be *allowed* to disagree with them. And apparently, we're not even allowed to think that."
197,"It has allowed me to find a bunch of people to mute on twitter though.  I mute people who use the word terf. I mean, I'd mute them if they called her a fucking b#%#h and it's the same sentiment (edited for slur)."
198,"~~Totalitarism~~ **Totalitarianism** (forgive me, I'm not a native english-speaker)"
199,If you don't agree that 2+2=5 you will be sent for reeducation.
200,Not participating in their life-long roleplay is *literal genocide*!
201,"Welcome to the realm of sanity. You are welcomed, listened to, and supported here."
202,You are welcome here. I'm very worried that it will become more difficult for women to seek safety from violent households if we continue along with this idea that identifying as a woman is the same thing as being one. Women need our own spaces. This idea that identifying biological sex is some great evil that must be squashed is a huge threat to important female only spaces.
203,WELCOME SISTER you are now home with those of us here that get it. ‚ò∫
204,"Welcome; this really is the only place I feel I can say what I think. I agree with every word J.K. Rowling wrote.  I too don‚Äôt care who has consenting sex with whom or what clothes they wear. I tell my teenage kids the same thing, so I‚Äôm certainly as a parent stressing ‚ÄúLove who you want to; no judgment.‚Äù But when they try to diminish what we have gone through with 30 years of monthly bleeding, pregnancy and childbirth, menopause ‚Äî and that‚Äôs just the physical stuff, no mention of being afraid to do trail runs alone, etc. ‚Äî well, that‚Äôs when I lose my patience."
205,"Welcome, sister."
206,">Ok today is the day. I've fucking peaked. Reading through the comments to her tweet has well and truly stuck the knife in.

Same. I didn't think it was possible to peak so many times in a single lifetime, let alone over the past few months, but here we are."
207,I bet she's reading this by the way
208,"> She might be filthy rich now but once upon a time she was the kind of woman who spent time in women's shelters.

I‚Äôm certain that this right here explains why she diverges from the Woke^TM neoliberal worldview on this specific point but converges with them on pretty much every other point."
209,"Exactly! All the libfems who play cheerleader for TiMs are middle to upper class women who have NEVER had to fear homelessness nor had to worry about what would happen if they were forced to be searched by a ""Lady Cop"" who is actually a male in a wig. They've also never had to fear that their one shot at a college scholarship would be stolen because a dude took their slot on the high school track team.

&#x200B;

It's easy to campaign for a policy when you have the money and privilege to insulate yourself from the consequences of said policy"
210,I totally agree. She has lived part of her adult life in poverty so she is incapable of buying into these ridiculous luxury beliefs. She knows what's at stake because she's actually lived it. Great point!
211,"I know, people are saying JK is advocating for the bullying of trans people. It's crazy how they twist her words. These commentators need to go to a Logic 101 class to learn how to argue against the words that are actually written, not some imaginary phrase they think goes along with it."
212,"Another thing stolen from women. It was originally ""Women's rights are human rights""."
213,"> *as if JKR is advocating for the hunt of trans people for sport.* 

Exactly! This is just manipulative hyperbole meant to shut down debate. No one is threatening them, yet if you say, *""sex is a biological reality, on the basis of which women are oppressed""*, all they say is, *""omg you're all so hateful and violent, trans rights are human rights‚Äù.* There is no in-between for these people, if you don't agree with them, then you're transphobic."
214,"> ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äù

This phrase has always confused me. What rights are they talking about? The right to assembly? Right to enter/leave their country? Right to not undergo unreasonable search or seizure? Cuz I'm pretty sure they have all of those. 

There is no 'right' to protect men in heels and dresses from weird looks..."
215,"Had a TRA in my replies the other week telling me women who disagreed with him should be hunted for sport, then acted all offended when called on it."
216,"> They love posting that photo of Emma Watson wearing the ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äùshirt, as if JKR is advocating for the hunt of trans people for sport.

In the minds of TRA's, there is no middle ground or room for debate. You must either swallow 110% of their dogma (including letting them in the bathroom with you and letting them castrate kids), or you're a NAZI who wants to round up all trans people and shove them into a giant gas chamber"
217,"If transphobia literally kills trans people, the undertakers must be working overtime today."
218,">People are losing their damn minds in the replies.

People are getting four-figure likes for pithy contributions such as ""stfu terf"", and all that goddamn anim√©..."
219,[deleted]
220,TRAs making more work for low wage workers? It's more likely than you think!
221,My ultra-christian coworker won't allow her kids to read them either.  There's another thing they have in common with the far right.
222,">went to local libraries and hid Rowling's books so patrons couldn't find them

That is just an inch away from burning books in the streets like actual bloody nazis."
223,"Did they do it because JK followed Magdalen Berns, or was there something else that she did?"
224,Funny how my conservative parents wouldn‚Äôt let me read her books as a kid because they were about ‚Äúwitchcraft.‚Äù  Funny also how they don‚Äôt seem to feel that way anymore.
225,Their kids are going to hate them.
226,"I went to the book store today and rolled my eyes at all the shitty libfem texts available. While I internally mourned the fact that people will read and be influenced by those garbage books, I didn‚Äôt attempt to prevent anyone from reading them. How scared do you have to be of an idea to prevent someone from making contact with something associated with it (not even with the idea itself!)?"
227,How do you find people in real life who think this way!? I must live in a very hick town because I doubt 99% of the population here in the real world knows what a TERF even is or care LOL.
228,How ridiculous. Perhaps they could also have an annual book burning in their garden - go the whole authoritarian hog.
229,Lol back in my day people refused to let their kids read them because they thought it was full of satanic spells. Funny how times change
230,I guess her books aren't being read out at Drag Queen Story Hour then?
231,Please report all such tweets as inciting violence. Twitter will take those reports seriously. It's basically a death threat dressed up.
232,"One particularly mindblowing tweet which showed up in my feed said something like ""an author's first duty is to make their readers feel safe.""

I'd always thought that an author's first duty is to open the reader's mind and imagination to other worlds (which at times indeed will make readers feel just a little unsafe) and to encourage them to see things from others' perspective, or at the very least just to tell a good story, but hey maybe all this time I was wrong ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
233,"This is great, coming from a massive celebrity and someone who's well-liked by the Left. 
As much as TRAs like to believe GCs are a shrinking minority, this makes it obvious that the social tide is shifting - and not in their favour. 

I notice it more now - colleages/friends/family of mine don't *want* to talk about this stuff because it's so easy to be labelled as -phobic, but when they do - they're as stunned as we are at this craziness."
234,"*ovaries

Ovaries of steel.

And she's going to need them; she's dipped her toes in the terven water before, so I'm sure she has a sense of the stakes, but I hope she's able to stand up to the avalanche of frothing vitriol and sniveling guilt-tripping that's coming her way."
235,"And she still had to preface the criticism with a bunch of qualifiers.  If you just say ""sex is real"" they treat it like you are hanging up ""its ok to be white"" signs.  The trolls are winning."
236,"Martina just tweeted about this, as well!"
237,"Exactly this. It's almost 2020, I am a med student that would like to do scientific research and today I learned I'm not allowed to say we can't change our set of chromosomes. How unreal is this? It's a bit scary."
238,*sorts by controversial*
239,"People are trying to make issues out of nothing. It's all an oppression olympics that lots of people try to play up. 

Jk Rowling has a completely rational stance, and it's not like she's an actual jerk who wants to make people's lives harder for no reason."
240,I believe that if trans males (it is usually males) could get away with beating and murdering women they would do it in a heartbeat. Psychotic.
241,"Here‚Äôs what gets me: if trans are such a tiny minority, then the people who are commenting under her tweet are mostly just woke folx and not actually trans themselves!"
242,The asylum just called asking for their lunatics back.
243,"I have been reading the comments and it is horrifying how vicious they are. It is indeed misogyny - completely undisguised misogyny - to call women garbage, to say we don't deserve rights, and of course, to express the desire to punch us. These people actually consider themselves virtuous for wanting to punch women."
244,"I think its mainly narcissistic rage/injury. What JK said was just common sense, a sentiment shared by most people, but they always have to present themselves as the victims so that their other behaviours such as intimidation, threads of violence, actual violence is justified by their enablers (or allies as they are commonly known)"
245,This is especially hilarious to me because I know at least two genderspecials who had Harry Potter themed weddings. LOL
246,"For real.

May as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb."
247,Well I hope that will now get the attention it deserves!
248,"Daaayum seriously, you got a source on that? I looked and couldn't find anything and have read a few articles about this."
249,">How can ANYONE with a functioning brain stem argue with that?

*""Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in  his right mind. It's been twisted and warped by fear. Now fear makes  people do terrible things, Harry. The last time Voldemort gained power  he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear. Now he's returned, and  I'm afraid the Minister will do almost anything to avoid facing that  terrifying truth.""*"
250,"they started trashing her long ago just for *liking* GC tweets, so I hope she‚Äôs out of fucks to give"
251,[deleted]
252,The harder these crazy men push the worse the pushback. They had better hold out on a world destroying women because if we ever get our rights back these men will be on the short stick of the bullshit they have been throwing at us (minus the rape and death threats).
253,love love
254,I miss her.
255,"1999: ""JK Rowling is a witch... burn the books!""
2019: ""JK Rowling is a ~~witch~~ TERF... butn the books!""

Time really does move in circles"
256,Words that specifically encourage their right to live however they like!!
257,"Yes there shall be many ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a TERF?‚Äù moments which lead to 

1) ‚ÄúEvil, stupid women who want to murder trans people! Hang them all!‚Äù (Although I‚Äôve never encountered a single call for trans violence, rejection of them as human beings, or even claims that they can‚Äôt, as Rowling said, have whatever ‚Äúexpression‚Äù and sexual orientation they‚Äôd like). 

2) ‚ÄúWomen out there making sense and saying what I never knew I could say or knew how to say‚Äù 

Number 2s, we welcome you.  Hell number 1s are welcome to hang out as well and discover they‚Äôre incorrect about us (if they‚Äôre capable of understanding the GC perspective)."
258,They're busy calling her a cunt. They're all supposedly women and yet they hurl the most sexist insults ever.
259,Rowling will dry her tears with her millions in her Scottish mansion. She doesn‚Äôt need to prove anything to anyone.
260,"No, they'll just declare that Harry Potter no longer belongs to JK and that all the characters are actually trans, so there! I've seen it happen before when a fandom doesn't like something the creator has done. They just decide they own it now and their narrative is the only one that matters. Now why does that sound familiar...."
261,"I‚Äôve already seen some of them disown her for just liking gender critical tweets or supporting other women last year.

I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs so upset by these people with the cognitive dissonance of a toddler."
262,I guess my libfem sister won‚Äôt like the Ravenclaw pajamas I got her for Christmas! üòÇ
263,Lol this makes me want to go buy some more HP merch.
264,Lol I was just thinking how two of the things they never shut up about HP and the trans are now in conflict.
265,I‚Äôm of the opinion that the Fantastic Beasts movies are well-written fan fictions (and the actors are superb!!). Cursed Child is blasphemy.
266,Hopefully they‚Äôll peak some people then. The fact that she is getting backlash for saying that sex is real is ludicrous and normal people understand this.
267,That‚Äôs exactly what I did as soon as I saw the tweet. Can‚Äôt wait to re-read the series over Christmas break!
268,This gives me a reason to get some of the new covers... hm...
269,My kiddo definitely needs the entire illustrated collection ASAP
270,"My son's about the right age for the HP series and has been asking me to get them for Christmas. I was going to get him the first 1 and see if he liked it before buying more, but now I'll be buying the whole collection, today."
271,"Then people see that, google ""what is a terf?"" and peak themselves."
272,"Good, it leads people here."
273,"it's insane and shows that these trans women are not women. Women have WAY more resolve, given the fact that we've had to deal with ACTUAL violence in our century long attempt to gain rights. Not this you-hurt-my-feelings violence everyone is claiming. 

but to be fear, a lot of libfem women are crying too so..."
274,Seems Stephen King did as well... interesting
275,‚ÄúCancel culture‚Äôs‚Äù bigger impact is that it silenced those afraid of being cancelled. If I spoke out about this my career would be over. OVER. People get cancelled in my business all the time for less. It‚Äôs very real.
276,ü§®This all started with a woman who got fired for saying biological sex is immutable.
277,Cancel culture doesn't affect rich men. If affects women of all backgrounds.
278,"Oh gosh. If you do, please share. I'd love to here some critical thoughts on the philosophy of HP. 

I hope you enjoy them, though!"
279,"I read them in my 20s. There is a lot there for adults, especially if you're interested in mythology, history or language (the spells and people's names are linguistic fun)."
280,"I've never read them either, but tempted to go buy the Galbraith ones just to support JK today."
281,"She‚Äôs super rich now, but she was a single mother on benefits and has used women‚Äôs shelters in the past. So I think she‚Äôs quite a good example of who should have a say in this discussion."
282,"Oddly enough, that particular episode was written by the Who writer who got his chapter canned from a book, because another writer in the collection said he was transphobic. The cancelled guy had a welsh name, was gay, more libertarian than radfem and had tweeted some GC ideas. I'm sure I posted it in r/cance11ed if you need the details."
283,"I retweeted it. I don‚Äôt have many followers, but the least I can do is boost her retweet numbers w positive messages."
284,"It's weird. It was a big step for me to like GC tweets. At first I just followed. Then I liked. Then I unfollowed anyone with pronouns in their bio, or anti-reality in their tweets. Then I muted people for that kind if anti-reality stuff. Maybe one day I will be brave enough to retweet."
285,"Not to mention one of the players in this case is a total misogynistic creep, beardo who identifies as ""non-binary"" and got sacked for calling women c\*nts."
286,"Calling her Delores Umbridge and her whose the group demanding we not say certain words and speak a certain way?

Do we just whisper Voldemort and run away?"
287,Not surprised they don‚Äôt seem to know the difference between fact and fiction. Just look at the amount of shit they spew.
288,and r/thisneverhappens
289,Well mentally ill men should get all the help they need but they aren't women that's all
290,"Even if the technology existed, biological sex would \*still\* exist. They can't cope with this very fundamental fact of life, and that is something they need a different kind of help with. I've reached a point I no longer believe the kind or compassionate thing to do is humor it in any way, it only exacerbates dysphoria (where it does exist), and emboldens the predatory types, putting everyone at risk."
291,She‚Äôs certainly made up for herero-fying Albus in FBAWTFT
292,"Jameela Jamil is a self-righteous fool. More women have died at the hands of transwomen than the other way round, yet they‚Äôre the group that needs protecting? She can fuck right off with her woke politics."
293,"They're trying to suicide threat her into obeying. Typical abusive ""I'm not abusing you"" tactic."
294,The responses are so hysterical. These people are really reaching and twisting her words.
295,"The only thing you're wrong about is that they don't lop off the penis, they turn it inside out. But yea you are correct. That's why you got banned, it makes them feel uncomfortable to see what they know deep down is the truth."
296,"Hallelujah, we can finally hoard all the merch for ourselves."
297,"A while back after she followed GC people on twitter but said nothing else, I suspected she lurked, or had an alt account. Now, anything goes! Hi Jo! We adore you."
298,Agreed They SHOULDN'T be flipping out over what she tweeted
299,"Saying sex and gender are different was just the trans movement's Trojan horse. Now that they have power, they're trying to erase sex altogether and install gender on the throne - see locker rooms, sports, sexual orientation. Everywhere where biological sex was considered the defining factor is now being harnessed to gender."
300,"In the UK, a woman who tweeted that biological sex could not be changed was fired by her employer. (Note that she wasn't accused of not using trans people's prefered names or pronouns, and in fact explicitly said that she would do so out of courtesy; it was simply her stated position that men are male, women are female, and the pretense that one can become the other is nothing more than a legal fiction.) Yesterday, a UK court upheld this woman's firing, claiming that her statement that people could not change sex was incoherent and incompatible with a democratic society. JKR is coming out in support of the fired woman, and by extension the many UK feminists who question the wisdom of overwriting sex with gender identity in UK law."
301,">And the fact that every SINGLE Western media outlet has like 10 stories specifically about this.... a TWEET!! And most of them have an obviously biased tone of condemnation against Rowling.

And yet I don't think a single one of the same news outlets could be arsed reporting on the  lesbian couple and their son who was murdered by a TIM prominent in the closure of Mitchfest. Another thing that never happened I guess."
302,"I've seen a grand total of one place where everyone in the replies isn't completely insane, and it's a shock because that was the LAST place I would've thought would have people saying biological sex isn't the same as gender and Maya Forstater shouldn't have been fired."
303,"I've heard that specifically described as emotional blackmail. 

Somehow the solution there isn't to get them proper help, oh no, it's to totally abandon all logic in favour of pandering to their delusion.

What makes them suicidal? Is it really just because some people don't want to adhere to their fantasy; or is it the fact that they're trying so hard to accomplish the impossible, fighting against reality itself to keep that fantasy alive in the first place?"
304,Yes and it‚Äôs the exact same manipulation used by misogynists! Who would have guessed!
305,Even after Transition these people are not okay
306,Off topic but at first I was confused when put Amanda Knox. I thought you were referencing the Amanda from the murder trials.
307,"Some even higher profile people, like those who are famous for more than their gender status, have started jumping on board. It's depressing."
308,"At least the like ratio gives me hope that we won't be seen as ""the wrong side of history."" I think the TRA's have fewer allies than they realize (even tho I hate that term, it's not like the trans community is being denied their basic rights as citizens)"
309,"outrage culture sucks because it looks like these people don't even read into what JK rowling really said:

>Live your best life in peace and security

is the same as wanting trans people to be unsafe???? lmao ok then. TRAs sound like dogmatic religions who think *not believing in god = hell*"
310,"And make threats of physical and sexual violence against us, which are somehow OK."
311,"Lmao seriously? I'm Jewish and never once assumed that from reading the books multiple times, that's hilarious!"
312,"Is it just me, or it seems antisemitic of THEM to instantly  associate greedy bankers with Jews?"
313,I‚Äôm guessing these people have never read a Stephen King book.
314,"It's like these people never look up fantasy and folklore references. Goblins have existed in folklore in Europe since the early 1100's at least, and have always been known to steal and horde money and jewels.  Anyone that says that the Gringotts goblins are Jewish tropes are outing themselves as antisemetic."
315,As if most of that kind of left aren't massive anti-semites themselves.
316,"If you carry a hammer around long enough, everything starts to look like a nail. Scraping literature for all the evils, and manufacturing it where it isn't present, this is the new paradigm for evaluating fiction."
317,"Ok to be fair people have been drawing the goblin - Jew comparisons for years. I‚Äôm Jewish, and upon first reading the books as a kid thought it was funny how many Jewish stereotypes the goblins embodied; greed, small-stature, cleverness, long noses,financial wiles, insularity, etc. Tho I don‚Äôt think JKR is anti-Semitic by any means, I do think she very likely drew on a certain trope without consciously recognizing that such a trope was historically assigned to Jews...and she probably should have been a bit more careful not to do that lol

Still a huge fan of hers tho of course"
318,"Chris Brown beat Rihanna until she almost died and most of his fans still support him and downplay the crime.

JK shares what is a common opinion in real life the left is happy to abandon her in order to appease trans extremists.

(Edit: I know it's not the same and you can criticize opinions, but damn if men don't get away with actual awful shit all the time and women are expected to shut up even when it comes to our own existence.)"
319,"While I agree, I don't see the point of the discussion going there since JK Rowling didn't do anything actually wrong. She doesn't think sex can actually be changed-- aka, she subscribes to reality."
320,">I‚Äôm shocked at the number of people who are acting like she‚Äôs retrospectively destroyed their childhood. I grew up reading the Alex Rider and Diamond Brother Series by Anthony Horowitz. They‚Äôre still my favourite teen books today, even though Horowitz has made some questionable remarks about having a black James Bond

The woke activists try to push for cancelling EVERYTHING a person has ever done if they say anything even vaguely ""problematic"". And they seem to think that, if you can look past the author's questionable statements and just enjoy their art, you are somehow agreeing with and/or validating everything they have ever said or done."
321,It‚Äôs because she‚Äôs a women. Men can get away with not being woke
322,"Well, maybe they would...they would just be housed with their appropriate sex, not gender. Because I'm pretty sure the staircases were bespelled to prevent teen pregnancy, not hurt feelings."

328,"Yeah, she won't. She's awesome. Successful, talented female writer who won't 'trans' any of her characters. 

So, TRAs can either... a) renounce her, her books (and half their childhood), or b) admit she has a point :)"

333,"Exactly. She was a broke single mom of three. She's had to fight for everything, and managed to write her way out of poverty."
334,"They have twisted the narrative completely, because now pointing out objective and scientific facts like ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt change sex‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen don‚Äôt have ladybrains‚Äù is bullying. It‚Äôs societal gaslighting. And if they now have the legal system playing along we are in trouble."
335,"She literally said ""live your best life in peace and security"" and they're still claiming she's supporting discrimination. Proof that being against violence and housing/job/medical/etc discrimination isn't enough, you have to go along with everything they say 100% or you'll be their next target."

339,"We need to stop being surprised that they are ""accidentally"" defaulting to logical errors, misinformation, inaccuracies, thought terminating cliches, emotional smear campaigns, and bullying. 

It's not an accident, they don't care about truth.

They are undermining truth and peoples' ability to speak it so they can force people to stop saying they believe in observable reality.

It's a hell of a task they took on and they're not going to achieve their ends through debate and facts and they know it on some level. That's why they don't engage in that kind of rhetoric and why they mostly bully."
340,"That's impossible though, because they don't *have* any arguments against what is actually said."
341,"what can you expect, men are always doing this with feminists

they ignore our legitimate points backed up by crime figues/gravestones then make worst case scenario assumptions and project it onto us in order to shut down debate. Men have been gaslighting women for centuries about our sex based fears- this is simply the new woke wave of it"

359,"I've been in that place before I peaked. First I went into that queer nonsense, but it didn't last long. Then the ""we cannot talk about that"" phase.

362,"Oh there's a massive wave of media condemnation coming her way though. People saying she ""joined the Death Eaters"" and crap like that in gossip blogs, I've only seen pushback in one sorta-liberal place and of course the TRAs are throwing tantrums there and calling every gc-looking commenter 'old' and JKR 'trash' and painting everyone as ""terfs"" who are simultaneously also ""right wing"". (Feminists? Radical feminists? Right wing?)."
363,"They can't really touch her. What are they going to do, block her on twitter? Why should she care?"
364,She's gonna be fine. She knows what she's doing.
365,"The qualifiers are for the normies watching on the sidelines who know nothing of this debate. TRAs will try and smear her with homophobia and intolerance, she‚Äôs making it clear that not the issue here."
366,She's being tactful and attempting to communicate with her audience from the lense through which they understand things. That should be commended and the GC movement needs to get better at it.
367,"Many of them are incels, no question about it"
368,Some of them openly say they fantasise about killing women and think killing and beating terfs should be legal.
369,Oh they already do. And if libfems acknowledge it at all it's only to virtue signal about how they should still be referred to as 'she' uwu.

It's good to see her standing up for other women and using her public image to spread awareness. Many people will be angered by Rowling, but many others will see the utter ridiculousness of firing a woman for saying biological sex cannot be altered and support Maya too."
383,"It's apparent how brainwashed these genderists are, when they just can't seren to grasp why a woman, *who had to use her initials to get anywhere as a writer*, would defend other women... JK knows what it's like to really be a woman & I commend her for speaking up."

This is how it happens!

I will lose a job in a hot minute for something like this but then again I had a tough upbringing & am really not with the bullshit. Also my value lies outside of capitalism and its demands so I really do not give a shit about some poncey woke male telling me to swing my hook bc I made a man in fishnets uncomfortable. I just think about the Nazi's to remind myself of the importance of speaking up for morality against the madness of crowds. So often people make out like they are trapped in their job- no you have trapped yourself in that job...the world is very big and there's plenty of employers who won't force you to believe biological sex is a lie. Way more than you think in fact...or worse comes to worse work at home/online for an agency. Work for yourself and cut out the woke middle man. Connect with your sisters, I'm sure at least one knows a position going or a lawyer of some kind. Don't allow them to make you feel fearful and trapped

Damn...it was only 30 years ago marital rape was legal...wake up women! We aren't as safe as you think! Our rights need constant defence in the numbers! Think of the bigger picture!

I hear a lot of women talking a big feminist empowerment game nowadays but when it comes to supporting their sisters in difficult situations and saying SEX IS REAL they are somehow easily swayed into silence or the 'ummm ermmm I don't know'?

He then dressed up in her clothes and was presumably going to live in her home and ""take over her life"" according to his manifesto.

Doesn't that just make ya feel the \~sisterhood\~ with TIMs?

They definitely are infatuated with womanhood to the point of violence, probably even more often than the average man, which is really saying something.

The show is on Hulu and I believe this is the last episode of season 3 if anyone is interested. It was tragic. People don't take stalking victims (which, no coincidence, are overwhelmingly women) seriously and it costs lives."

I'm sure many of them will come forward and sue once they get old & wise enough to realize what was stolen from them. But I fear that a lot of them might not be able to because, for all we know, the combination of blockers & cross-sex hormones in childhood will cause them to die extremely young. :("
436,"This makes me wonder if lots of folklore and mythical creatures itself originated in historical stereotypes/caricatures of it's day, but since it's been passed on for hundreds of years through general fiction stories the original connotations have lost their intended meanings for the later generations, who reinterpret them in their modern fantasy works.

So basically, you might be able to argue these tropes are rooted from a anti-semitic/racist/sexist place, but modern writers aren't consciously using them for those specific implications.

Not sure if what I'm saying makes sense since it's not that eloquent, but I'm hoping the point I'm trying to convey is coming across."

They love the beyonce empowerment songs and the 'future is female' malarkey when they broke up with a guy....but when it actually comes to opening your mouth & getting in trouble for your sisters they'd rather look sideways and let some other woman do it

Unfortunately the vote was not won by the former sorts of women....it was entirely dependant on the latter growing large /loud enough. But it benefited them all...and perhaps the silent ones should remember that"
445,They think the right to be free from any criticism or being held accountable for their actions are human rights.
446,"Peppa was banned due to links with mobsters, but was unbanned for the year of the pig."
447,"yeah precisely think of your local crack addict that dresses wild- doubt you'll see many people giving her sympathy

but a grown professional male in his 40s wearing dresses MUST be respected

I'm sorry I think a lot of it is them being jealous that women get attention- as in women have used tools of oppression like makeup etc to make their money & capitalise off it

I hear soooo many men talking about 'instagram thots' etc and they just all sound incredibly jealous and hypocritical since most times they are watching similar looking women on porn or liking their photos

Now the menz are jealous of this and they want in, but only once they've lived a full life of male privilege and had a midlife crisis. They have to infiltrate everything

For men, makeup is a choice. For women its largely due to pressure and the fact its expected etc but women learn to use it to their advantage. This seems to fly past them and think femininity = makeup"
448,"This, I have always spoken up, even when my survival depended on my job.  Used to be racism though, the fact this is harder is actually insane. Not trying to shame those who don't want to take risks but it's going to get a whole lot worse if more women don't do it, even politely."
449,"I‚Äôm shunned and gossiped about at work because I‚Äôm the only one who won‚Äôt put pronouns in my email. It‚Äôs absurd to me that‚Äôs even a fighting point but here we are. I also had a tough upbringing and won‚Äôt start cowering *now* as an adult. Every one of us is capable of acts of resistance no matter how small and it‚Äôs our duty to show these mobs that we won‚Äôt buy in no matter the cost. 

Just imagining where this could go if we all start conceding that sex is not valid and women do not deserve protected rights is horrifying. How can the misogyny of these ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù agendas going unseen be at once so unsurprising and still so unbelievable?"
450,"This rings true for me too and never quite thought about an obvious reasoning: I too had a hard upbringing. A lot of neglect and abuse, needing to spend all nights and afternoons in the library to stay safe...I read a lot, I developed a hard sense of empathy but was never with the in in crowd so passing fads and acceptance was something I gave up on young and those things stopped having an affect on me. But they affected the friends I'd make in and after college..."

They can't really do anything but hurl their ridiculous accusations at her that everyone can see are not true."

463,"Good I'm glad to hear!! Sometimes bravery /personal sacrifice is required to get the message heard loud and clear. We need more like you!

I'm sorry but in 2019 I'm kinda cringed out by the sheer number of women who have allowed someone to convince them biological sex isn't real& to give up the rights of other women without any solid evidence whatsoever to confirm this. I mean its not a complicated thing- biological sex is MATERIALLY evident- it takes some passivity to believe its not. Its one thing to know its bs and not speak out of fear...but its another entirely to actually buy into behind closed doors & be part of its manifestation throwing other women under the bus for some woke SJW points for a tiny mentally unstable minority. I think the latter set of women need to have an even stronger word with themselves than the former. As in they clearly need to learn to have humility/ assertiveness. Some of these women had to be told 28874329 examples of why this is a bad idea for them to finally get it- I think that signals ignorance.

I don't want to hear your feminist views if you're all fluff when it comes to defending our boundaries. Thats just lip service- and we need more action. We need more women that put their foot down when they're say they're going to

I never bought it- I remember the first time I got put in the hot seat for my views in a room full of lib fem students who already despised me for not being a hipster....and the minute I spoke up they fell silent and the trans lecturer called me transphobic...but you could tell on their faces they wanted to nod and agree. They were just scared.. & I thought WTF? Are we back in the 50s??? Whats the point having access to education/ right to vote if women aren't going to use their voices???!

I couldn't NOT say anything because it sounded so bullshit...and was being taught to people in higher education- I immediately wanted to debate what he was saying. It was like a lecturer claiming the earth is flat to a bunch of naive paying students

All for asking what happens to womens boundaries if we allow men to say they're women...that was my crime

I knew from that day forth this TERF/ transphobe business was just a convenient way for men to say 'shutup woman'. The minute I asked them to defend their position I was shut down. Says it all really"
464,">if they do, it would be a big news story. it would draw a lot of very interested eyeballs onto what the little despots are doing.

Agreed. I'd LOVE to see them try it. Siccing the cops on the creator of Harry Potter because she dared to state a basic scientific fact is going to draw international attention to the UK and it's insane ""hate speech"" policy"
465,"It's happened several times now. Someone complains to the police that you're using ""hate speech"" (Hate speech laws in England and Wales are found in several statutes. Expressions of hatred toward someone on account of that person's colour, race, disability, nationality (including citizenship), ethnic or national origin, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation is forbidden.) - quoting wikipedia here - and the police will come and investigate. Even if what you said doesn't reach the standard of hate speech, the fact that you've been questioned by the police is officially recorded. Did you notice which category is NOT covered by this law?"
466,"Speaking of shutting down free speech, apparently one of my links would be removed (reddit auto message) because the Spectator is ""conservative"". Yes, it's right wing but it's hardly Breitbart. And one of their writers, James Kirkup, has been doing a good job covering the GC issues in the UK. So banning it from this sub seems....odd.

Anyhow, on the non-criminal ""hate incidents"" that get people harassed by the cops, Kirkup wrote about a 74 year old woman getting the Suffolk cops sicced on her for saying ""gender isn't real"" on her blog."
467,"Unfortunately yes. Non-criminal ""hate incident"". Multiple people have had the cops show up to ""check their thinking"" on trans stuff.

Male medical professionals & investors? Absolutely nothing left wing about this deep down

Yes I agree the authorities are serious cowards- they have been infiltrated by political ideology & people are fast waking up to this BS. I think they can smell the lawsuits coming

This is why I have always been suspicious of people who are quick to defend 'authority' on that basis alone...if a doctor told you poison was good for you, would you believe it? I'm sure there's some arrogant gullible people who would & would readily argue with you about YOUR arrogance lmao

To me this just signals something off is happening with British healthcare- they have been selling bits off to private healthcare firms for some time. I truly believe one motivation for them doing this is to overwhelm the NHS with trans patients thus pushing it further into desperation that can only be 'saved' through more privatisation (I mean seriously- its costs MONEY to dish out these hormone blockers/medical transitions/mediate lifelong effects). And I believe this even more so because trans culture is very established/widespread in America where for profit healthcare is already the same  (they NEED customers= ¬£¬£¬£¬£). With free healthcare there is incentive to keep people well as that drains the government less & keeps costs down. Thus to me, this signals Britain's NHS moving towards a for profit structure.

And ofc the icing on the cake is that they can erode womens hard fought boundaries that they resent allowing us have (to a degree). Can't have equality if you can't tell who's who!!

There's a million other reasons I believe they're doing this...but those are the main 2"

I really feel with this Brexit malarkey (which is going to dint the UK economy longterm anyway) this is their perfect chance to slide it in under the carpet. There will be a lot of hoo har though bc the UK is very protective over the NHS

Yeah exactly! People overlook this aspect when I mention it as if its a conspiracy but its really not. The NHS has been struggling for some time due to forced austerity since the financial crash etc...and quite frankly the NHS could do WITHOUT a huge influx of trans kids and all their complications adding to the bill. I mean the trans journey is quite a long & costly experience...and the government funded NHS has to foot the bill for taht. The fact they are getting behind the trans BS just makes me more suspicious this is all part of their plan to overwhelm and privatise the NHS

484,"Great news for sanity. That site is hilarious, BTW.

If anyone is curious why TIMs insist on entering womens sports even though everyone can see they have an unfair advantage, in order for a sex change to be 100% and never mentioned again legally, they need to be included as women for sporting events. TIMs being banned from female sporting events would mean their actual sex would always have to be a matter of record. So they will fight this one to the death. It's probably going to be one of the things that sink in the court of public opinion because it's obvious even to the average sports fan a TIM has an unfair advantage over women.

You'll also notice the article avoids the fact that recent research is showing they maintain male muscle strength even after T blockers, and TIMs are two SD large than females. Which means an average size TIM has at least a 2SD head start in terms of strength on plain old Jane. This means only about only about 1/40 women is as strong or stronger as the average TIM.

EDIT: just realised a some of you won't know what 'SD' means. It's [standard deviation](http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) and it's referring to a distribution curve. The average man is 6 inches taller than the average woman. [Image to help you visualise what this means in terms of groups.](https://tall.life/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/New-height-distribution-with-legend.jpg) About one man in three is 6ft or over, and about 1% of women.

485,">	USA Powerlifting has banned all transgender women from competing as women, even as a trans powerlifter in Minnesota recently won a state championship with another association, setting a state record.

>	JayCee Cooper, a trans woman, had applied last year to compete in a recent USA Powerlifting event in Minnesota. In December her application was denied.

>	‚ÄúMale-to-female transgenders are not allowed to compete as females in our static strength sports as it is a direct competitive advantage,‚Äù wrote USAPL Therapeutic Use Exemptions Committee Chair Kristopher Hunt in an email to Cooper.

>	Hunt followed up with Cooper in January with this explanation:

>‚ÄúTransgender male to female individuals having gone through male puberty confer an unfair competitive advantage over non-transgender females due to increased bone density and muscle mass from pubertal exposure to testosterone.‚Äù

>	The ‚Äúbone density‚Äù red herring has been thrown out there for years, at least since MMA fighter Fallon Fox appeared on the scene. The bone density of black women is, on average, significantly higher than that of white women. In fact, some studies have shown the bone strength of black women to be higher than that of white men.


>	Yet we don‚Äôt see any great rush to divide lifting categories by race (which of course would be ridiculous), proving this bone-density argument to be nothing but a canard designed to specifically target trans athletes.

>	Hunt did not respond to an email requesting clarification.

>	Still, USA Powerlifting‚Äôs ban on transgender women competing as women is in place.

>‚ÄúUSA Powerlifting is not a fit for every athlete and for every medical condition or situation,‚Äù the organization said in a statement. ‚ÄúSimply, not all powerlifters are eligible to compete in USA Powerlifting.‚Äù

>	USA Powerlifting did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

>	The organization‚Äôs ban has forced Cooper to look for other opportunities to compete, landing her at events hosted by the U.S. Powerlifting Association. The USPA is smaller and holds fewer events in Cooper‚Äôs home state. But she‚Äôs happy to be able to compete.

486,"What does the journalist mean 'the right side of history?' The side of history the marginalises women in their own sports categories, that let a trans women NOT declare their trans status and proceeded to smash a woman's skull in, that let's feelings triumph over logic and science?

I don't think the journalist is the one on the 'right side of history'. Anyone who disagrees with the idea that transwomen should NOT be allowed to participate in women sports, and instead says they should be allowed, does not care about women at all."

493,">Trans athletes should not be feared but celebrated fiercely.

This is a little off topic, but why does disagreement all get labeled as fear? It doesn't sound like USA Powerlifting was making the decision out of fear. You could argue the science is wrong or that the decision is based on misinformation, but declaring everyone who disagrees as ""phobic"" or ""fearful"" is just dismissive. It sounds like as a governing body the goal (whether right or not) is to keep the sport fair. Fear of unfairness? Really?"

I would naturally expect those distributions to have greater spread because the physiological differences between males and females are exaggerated at high levels of competition; i can swim faster than all my male friends, but I could never swim faster than michael Phelps, even if i grew a foot.

She made a not so veiled threat (around min 58) that the Crossfit Association had to settle after facing millions in legal actions.  Interesting, how these 'individuals' can find the necessary funds to take people to court!

We would occasionally  go to the weight room for pt. And there were a few super hardcore women who powerlifter and hit the gym every day that ran the gambit of lifting with me, to out pacing me, to one female who actually  started to keep up with some of the male power lifters. But all that being said........I was never trying to work out like that and it took that much effort for most to work out at what I saw as pretty average male lift weights.

This is such bullshit.  It's to target **males**.  It's a physical competition, what your gender identity is is irrelevant to whether you should be allowed to compete.  If it were to target trans athletes men would be allowed to compete but transgender people would not.

It's kind of like how most of us grew up with Christopher Columbus as a hero.

And EVERYONE else regardless of their place in society has to maintain continuity of identity from birth to coffin - why? to protect society as a whole against the harms of a few wrongdoers.

Or you might need to be okay with it being a hobby and having fun with it, instead of needing to win at it.

I'm disabled and very few ""feminists"" worry about professional sports being completely inaccessible to me.  They certainly don't worry about it to this ridiculous level and I was born female.

It would be impossible to make racial categories in sport, since there would be no way of knowing who belongs where. There is however a pretty easy way of classifying people into the two human sexes.

Not sure if bone density as much to do as muscle and upper body strength, in weightlifting anyway.

Edit:

Also, after menopause, it is loss of 'estrogen' a that makes women susceptible to menopause.  Most probably it is the loss of testosterone in TIMs that make them susceptible.

There are genetic differences in different populations of people. These differences exist in hair type, skull shape and population genetics. Scientists can examine  skeletonized remains and determine what population of people they came from. They wouldn't be able to do that if humans weren't genetically different.

I meant (in the UK) where when you become a client of say a solicitor you have to show them that you have existed for a long time, and they have to google you to check you don't fall into particular categories. So if someone has a name change, like say a Lord coming into an inheritance, they provide birth cert with birth name, then deed poll to current title, because the other documents will have the original name until the deed poll, then the new name afterwards. The system is created to cope with there being a change of name.  
Similarly if you are a woman and get married and take your husband's name, except there you provide the marriage certificate.

There's a continuity of ID.

Whereas withthe self ID legislation (that's just been kicked into the long grass here in the UK) there's an assumption that there's a prior 'dead name' that won't ever be used again. And the new name. Well that's just NOT feasible in a society that, for example, has antimoney laundering rules to protect against terrorism and crime. The protection has a higher public good than the attempt to stop dead naming.

Not sure that's any clearer. But basically, if you change your name, your old name/existence follows you. As Freddie the seahorse has found - the court said only women can give birth to kids, therefore your current name is on the birth certificate, under the mother box not the father box. The law is interested in what's going to make sense in society for the long term - not magical thinking currently in vogue.

We don't actually have ID cards in teh UK, it was mooted but there was such an outcry it didn't happen. Which is fine, until you don't have a passport or a driving licence, then since 9/11 and the changes in ID verification rules, doing anything official becomes a nightmare...."

There recently was a scandal when it was found that many doctors erroneously believed that black people have thicker skin than whites, and treated accordingly. 

Does testosterone or oestrogen contribute to higher bone density or lack thereof?"
652,"Yep, it absolutely does"
653,"That‚Äôs what kills me. Whenever the TRA‚Äôs rage about this shit, they‚Äôll point to one single factor and claim that it varies amongst women. And, yeah, these things *do* vary. Some women have a lower q-angle, other women are really tall, whatever. But the TRA‚Äôs choose not to acknowledge (and the uninformed general public seems to not fully understand) that it‚Äôs the *multiple, compounding* physiological differences between males and females that ultimately confers the advantage and warrants the ban."
654,I won't be surprised if that study compared career female weightlifters vs pasty basement neckbeards who would already huff and puff after a 3 minute jog lol
655,"It made me curious how r/weightlifting's regarding the entire issue. Fortunately, there's still sanity, peppered with the fuck offs that cry misgendering and ""Such vile transphobia in here! SHE'S A WOMAN!!"" 

I even found out that Laurel Hubbard's very wealthy FATHER used to be involved/headed the NZ weightlifting association and led the creation of the trans qualifications. Well now... ain't that grand. And they have the gall to say ""It's not her fault! She just wants to lift! She's just following the rules."" Yeah, no."
656,"Well good luck classifying people into these categories then. I can already see it ""this is a competition for 30% Irish 70% sub-saharian people only, sorry but you don't fit the pre requirements"". 
Of course there are genetic differences between ethnicities, there are even genetic differences between blonde people and red heads, and that doesn't make it a race. And if we take that route there are also differences from one family to the other and even in those families from the descendants of one person to those of another, which is why we don't all look the same and have the same attributes..."
657,"Doesn't everyone, really?"
658,Yes they do. Most of the alt-right hate trans people and want nothing to do with them. They are seen as freaks and not accepted.
659,Lol. Wut? But powered exo-skeletons will be legal?
660,and I agree. they need to stop!
661,"What? Asian people can hold their own in basketball. Have you heard of Yao Ming?

Sure, there might not statistically be as many 6ft+ Asian players, but at least it's physically possible. It's not physically possible for men to become women.

We don't need separate leagues for race, that's crazy racist."
662,"Yeah, but there are outliers in any race , like Yao Ming the basketball ball player for instance. Sports and genetics can‚Äôt be made fair. But separating by sex is common sense, I mean men and women are obviously built completely different?"
663,"I think estrogen actually enhances bone strength in women. Like women who skip periods due to high-intensity cardiovascular athletics are always warned they are at a higher risk of osteoporosis when they get older, because the lack of periods/estrogen weakens bones in the long run."
664,ah. nepotism is alive and well... I note it's not the mother that has the power and wealth and is pushing for the son to invade the female side of the sport.
665,"Why would they be illegal? They're work tools, not weapons. They're meant to aid in heavy lifting in warehouses, care homes etc. Last time I checked, hammers are still legal even though they could be used to kill someone."
666,"Op literally said to use one to fight off rapists. If they could be used to fight off rapists then they would be weapons. The legality of weapons varies from place to place. 

Are you 12 years old?"
667,"A hammer, frying pan, glass bottle, or a camera tripod could also be used to fight off rapist. And yet they're legal virtually everywhere."
668,"The point was that we are not strong enough. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are waving a frying pan. Our best chance is to lower the number of rapists and just run away. I was delusional too, I tought that I would fight off like my fav characters, but this is putting myself in dangerous situations. If you are not doing weight lifting every day and boxing, self defense etc I suggest running away and just so you know, I trained for running and cross competitions during 4 years and most guys my age just come and they‚Äôre better than me. One day I saw a 6ft guy just run in front of me jokingly (he was playing with his friends) while I was coming back home, and he was so *fast* none of us can do this. Just imagine how done a girl who don‚Äôt do sport is if someone like this (1 in 3 guy is like this) try to harm her."
669,It's so gay it's straight
670,"Can truly say I've never thought of it this way, but I completely agree. We're told to examine our ""preferences"" yet get silenced if we even suggest therapy to trans identified individuals."

681,"The answer, as always, is to follow the money."
682,"Well, I hate to break it to you but most of trans people just don't want to change their genitals. I have commented my Peak Trans experience on this sub about a trans identified female, who basically look like any random woman, yet really wanted to be called and considered male. Her """"""gay"""""" boyfriend (he identifies as gay but says he dislikes penises, lol) even says that people shouldn't expect trans people to get bottom surgery lmao. They say transitioning is hard but they basically fight the whole world for it to get adjusted to them (them: 0,1% of the population at best)."
683,Awesome.
684,"Exactly! Gender dysphoria should be seen as a mental health issue, not something that can be solved by having your genitals changed. There's actually a very high number of sex-change people who've regretted having their genitals operated on but obviously can't go back."

693,"The ones who are pushing lesbians and gays (and straights for that matter) to violate their sexual preferences are usually the ones who do love their own genitalia.  Many (if not most) transgenders never get ""bottom surgery"" and don't even want it.  They love their penises and want to force lesbians to love their penises as well."
694,"Or even gay conversion therapy in the first place, at that rate."
695,Oh this is PERFECT.
696,I'm not sure what the first part is referring to?
697,"In what other mental illnesses is society expected to encourage the delusions of the mentally ill? Like are we supposed to pretend schizophrenics are actually God? Supposed to pretend that depressed people should commit suicide? But for the trans delusion we have to pretend they are the sex they ""feel"" they are, and we have to mollycoddle them, welcome men into female only areas, and even welcome them into our beds....whether we want to or not, for fear of being labelled a TERF or transphobic."
698,"This is what I don't get. 

If your gender is innate like they say it is (that's the whole point of their movement), the thing that would make most sense is therapy to try to come to peace with your body, while your mind can be whatever-fucking-gender it wants."

The author of the post concedes that no one *has* to date transwomen, but makes it clear that if you don't date transwomen, it reflects poorly on your character:

>You aren't into penii *[sic]*. I get it, and for what it's worth neither am I. To be fair, many trans women who carry that particular anatomical burden are not big fans of it either, so you have that in common at least. But many trans women don't, and many of those who do won't for long. **Be careful about using this biased sample to rule out all trans women.**

>Also, **would you rule someone out because she had six toes?** Whenever I hear a straight man ask how sex works in the absence of a penis, I feel sorry for his girlfriends/wife, because he clearly doesn't understand how sexytimes work; **when I hear a lesbian rule out trans women because of the presence of a hidden penis I feel sorry for her partner, because how superficial is that?**

So yeah. There is actually immense, ubiquitous pressure on lesbians to be open to dating transwomen, and you clearly don't know what the fuck you're talking about."

Below is from an older article so I'm not sure what advances have been made. I'm also not sure what to make of the last two sentences of the abstract. The study itself requires payment to read. [Found ironic (?) typo in lead sentence.]

Orgasm in the postoperative transsexual.

Lief HI, et al. Arch Sex Behav. 1993.

Abstract

The dearth of information regarding organism [sic] in postoperative transsexuals prompted the authors to study its prevalence. The sample consisted of 14 male-to-female (M-F) and 9 female-to-male (F-M) postoperative transsexuals. The relationship of orgasm to sexual and general satisfaction was explored via a specially designed questionnaire. Orgastic capacity declined in the M-F group and increased in the (F-M) group. Despite the decrease in orgasm in the M-F group, satisfaction with sex and general satisfaction with the results of surgery were high in both groups. General satisfaction of 86% replicates other studies. Frequency of sex increased by 75% in the M-F group and by 100% in the F-M group. A phalloplasty does not appear to be a critical factor in orgasm or in sexual satisfaction. The general conclusion is reached that it is possible to change one's body image and sexual identity and be sexually satisfied despite inadequate sexual functioning."
769,I think they try and attach the neophallus somewhat to the clitoris and I know Balian Bushbaum has talked about 'having sex as a man' but I honestly can't imagine it working
770,"Yh I agree that words should mean things, that's why I always make the distinction when speaking factually. If it's just everyday conversation kinda stuff I will use a trans persons preferred pronouns.

If we were talking about serious stuff like I dunno.. whether trans-women should be put in women's prisons, if they should be allowed to compete as women in sports, stuff like that.. then yeah I will tell it like it is and point out the fact that they are trans-women, not women."
771,I think we can be critical of gender and still not make a point at the expense of embarrassing or making someone uncomfortable. Come on.
772,"Obviously I do. I am a woman. Why is this all being put on me? What do you want me to do, harass trans people in the street? If somebody asks me my views, I'll tell them, simple.

At work, of course I'm not going to use someone's 'undesired' pronouns just to prove some point and get my dumb ass fired, I can't afford to do that, I need pay for stuff just like everyone else."

790,"Nobody's forcing you to work there. If you disagree morally, seek another position."
791,The things I heard from men when growing up are being echoed by the trans community and woke leftists. Sexual orientation is NOT a choice.
792,"There‚Äôs a minority of people without dysphoria wearing the label ‚Äútrans‚Äù as a get out of jail free card. Those are the ones who are (generally, there‚Äôs bound to be some dysphoric people too) demanding sex from lesbians and suggesting that not liking penis is ‚Äúgynophilia‚Äù- a perverse attraction to female genitalia as opposed to the female sex- and that lesbians should re-examine that. 

If you don‚Äôt see why that‚Äôs a problem, you‚Äôre blind. Lesbians have to overcome compulsory heterosexuality, and imagine overcoming the hardest hurdle to accepting who you are, and then someone from inside your own house (lgbt community) says what sounds like the exact same thing. Here‚Äôs a helpful script. 

SOCIETY: You have to like dick, sleep with men. 

LESBIAN: I‚Äôve tried to overcome it but I just don‚Äôt like dick, I quite like women, actually. I think I‚Äôll date women from now on. 

LGBT COMMUNITY: You like women? That‚Äôs great. These women have dicks and you have to be open to sleeping with them because they are more vulnerable than you and women can have dicks. 

LESBIAN: Actually I just like vulva. I don‚Äôt want to be involved with a dick. 

LGBT COMMUNITY: WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU‚ÄôRE SAYING? You can‚Äôt say that!! There‚Äôs plenty of ways to have sex without PIV penetration, you know! 

And just real quick? Most of us have experienced this phenomenon. So I don‚Äôt understand where you get off, thinking you can come into our place and tell us how our experiences work. We have conversations here. We don‚Äôt just TELL each other how things are, that‚Äôs it, no other opinions."
793,"How do you know what ‚Äútransbians‚Äù do or not do when sexually pursuing a woman when you‚Äôre not the one they‚Äôre pursuing? That‚Äôs like telling black people racism doesn‚Äôt exist because you personally haven‚Äôt experienced it as a white person. 

Also, get the fuck out of our space. We don‚Äôt need a brainwashed fool who‚Äôs drank the ‚Äúfeels > reals‚Äù koolaid so hard to mansplain to us that our experiences didn‚Äôt happen and the misogyny/rape culture prominent within the TIM community doesn‚Äôt exist."
794,"Off topic, but I disagree. I‚Äôm not vegan but I love that Luna  and Larry‚Äôs coconut milk based ice cream. It‚Äôs anything but disgusting!"
795,"Yep, it would feel much more sanitary. especially after the pictures I've seen of necrotic tissue, blood blisters, pus, infections on them. Whatever, just being honest."
796,And your body doesn't try to reject the dildo
797,"I guess for a trans-man it's better than having a vag, right?"
798,Voluntary FGM....imagine the privilege you have to have to be able to do this...while women in 3rd world countries have been trying to fight against this for ages.
799,"Sure, many trans people may be more comfortable with their sexuality after transition and therefore more responsive and open. TIFs are taking testosterone which will boost sex drive and with nerves retained from clitoris, which is twice as enervated as penis, it makes physiological sense that TIFs are more sexually satisfied post surgery. I wish it were less sexually rewarding in terms of social consequences but at least I understand transitioning more, given this information. 

The bright point of what I read was that some TIMs will only masturbate rather than seek out sexual partners, due to the complexity of their genital situation. I honestly do feel badly for them but am relieved that the conflict of having TIMs pushing for sexual acceptance in lesbian social spaces may be lessened by some TIMs choosing to take things into their own hands. Sorry, I'm a pragmatist."
800,That's my thought.
801,"I suspect as much. A TIF I know wrote on their blog, after starting T, that they were totally floored by how horny they were. Like, constantly horny. I gather it settles down a bit."
802,"No, it's just that if they've gone through all that trouble to pump themselves full of hormones and alter their body to the point where they are no longer recognisable/resemble the sex that they were born as, it seems a bit stupid to go on calling them by pronouns that seem so far from that person's original form. That's the way I see it anyway, I guess maybe a small part of me is rewarding them a little bit then.. but a trans-man with a full beard, flat chest and deep voice is no longer a woman to me, soo.. we have to call them something."
803,Lol no
804,Yo we are totally on the same page! That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. I just mean I don‚Äôt want to argue to someone who is dysphoric to their face. I‚Äôm in a humanities masters program rn that includes gender studies (blech ) so there are many people that I have to address by plentiful pronouns. The first day of class we had to wear name tags with our pronouns on them. It‚Äôs tiresome. (I didn‚Äôt fill my pronouns in as a tiny personal protest. ) anyways just sayin there‚Äôs appropriate behaviors to follow regarding individuals vs the issue of gender widely? Idk it‚Äôs 2 am and my brain is on half power.
805,"Yh, in an Ideal world I guess we could all just quit our jobs whenever we don't agree with a colleague's views ¬¨\_¬¨"
806,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a minority. The ‚Äúgenital preference‚Äù = TERF/Literal violence thing is quickly becoming their mainstream ideology
807,Biological facts dont care about your hurt feelings. Men are men. Women are women. Trans people are a category of their own....
808,"But you're not an ice cream maker or critic or whatever...my point was more that if you are an enthusiast about something, you are more likely to want very authentic and high quality thing, rather than an imitation. 

There are vegan brands that are really good and definitely hit the spot. But if you're being a purist, they're not ice cream. Just like TIFs don't really have penises."
809,">but a trans-man with a full beard, flat chest and deep voice is no longer a woman to me

 So, to clarify, to you what a woman is comes down to appearance?"
810,Okokok
811,So there are some delusions you dont encourage then....
812,"And its seeping over into the ""woke left"" lexicon. The mantras of ""transwomen are women and transmen are men"" reminds me of being brainwashed in the catholic church with slogans, phrases and false dichotomies.

813,"That‚Äôs the issue, isn‚Äôt it? There is a very small minority of ‚Äúactually trans‚Äù people with dysphoria and no real want to participate in the absolute shitshow their movement has become. And then there‚Äôs this massive majority of men masquerading as trans for attention or more nefarious reasons, and they‚Äôre making all the publicity!"

816,"I don't encourage delusions, I tolerate them in settings where I think it would be inappropriate for me to interrogate the person, for example at work. Maybe you see that as encouraging..

I have no issue questioning/challenging trans people in my free time though.

818," I was just confused because the type of hair on your face, and your voice and, the size of your breasts are appearance things.

 I often interact with TIFs, as colleagues and clients. And every time I‚Äôm forced to say ‚Äúhe‚Äù there‚Äôs this metal grating sound inside my head. So, no.  When I see them I see a woman with a lot of self-hatred, and I have so very much compassion for them even when they‚Äôre acting like fucking assholes. But I can only have that compassion for them because I know they‚Äôre women who have internalized  so much misogyny that they‚Äôve tried to cut it out, cover it up, or poison it away."
819,"What if they asked to be referred to as a woman? You know there are people that physically 'transition' but still retain sexed pronouns, right? 

https://streamable.com/tq514

There is nothing wrong with being a feminine male. There is nothing wrong with being a masculine female. Sexed pronouns help us establish reality and prevent us from perpetuating harmful gender roles."
820,"I speak what I feel. I'll say whatever pronouns you want, but have been very vocal in the fact that there are areas and spaces where men are not welcome. Whether they have fake boob implants or not. A womens domestic abuse shelter or rape shelter is NOT the place for transwomen. An all-womens team is also not the place for them. I'll call you whatever bullshit you want to be called, but once you infringe on my space (I'm a lesbian rape surviver) then you can take your xy chromosomes and fuck right off."
821,Exactly. That's what makes it so dubious. The only ties they have with womanhood are only superficial...
822,">I love caring for children

X to doubt. I've read so many transwidow stories about how their TIM selfish husband turned 'wife' literally did nothing for their kids before or after transition. (one said she couldn't trust him to FEED the baby if she wasn't there) But they'll certainly demand to be called mommy without doing the actual work of being a mother. They're such liars."
823,"I'm sure they exist somewhere, but I've never read anything from a TIM claiming how much he loves kids.  I have read many times how much they want the experience of periods, pregnancy, and nursing, though."
824,"All true except please note, they NEVER say they want to clean all day. Or at least, I have never heard that, ever. It's all about makeup and high heels.  They never crave the boring/negative/passive/drudging aspects of stereotypical femininity. ""I must be a woman because I can't wait to do 95% of the housework, be passive and deferential to men and then make less money than they do even though I'm equally qualified,"" said no TiM ever."
825,This concisely puts into words the lingering question I secretly always had as a liberal feminist: What the fuck do clothing and hobby preferences have to do with being a woman or man?!
826,I love pointing out the parallel to gender ideology and race ideology. if the world wants to accept males putting on makeup as females then why are we not accepting Rachel Dolezal as an African American?
827,"Just to play the devil's advocate, what about TiMs who say something along the lines of ""I'm male and have dysphoria. Socially presenting as female helps alleviate some of that dysphoria which results in an increase in the quality of life, but I acknowledge that I am not a woman, and that being transgender is a different set of life experiences than women have."" Are there even trans who talk like that?"

Soon after my AGP TIM ex-husband declared he was ""a woman in a man's body,"" we were at an outdoor potluck.  When rain started up, I got up to cover the food.  Then I thought, Nah, if he wants to be a woman, he can do it!  Not giving away the ending if I say the food remained uncovered."
848,None of them dream of working in sweatshops either.
849,"I've taken a peek in a few trans discussion boards and there are genuinely people who want to be stay-at-home mothers and take care of the children and the house. And have a husband who's the breadwinner. So the ""traditional"" setup. Not saying there's anything wrong about being a stay-at-home mother but like... some of them seem to act like that's what you should strive for."
850,"Just watched a documentary last night on Netflix about her.  I learned that not only is she more delusional than I thought, and arrogant, and self centered to the max, but all those qualities and everything she said can be applied equally to trans people."
851,"There are, but they would be considered heretics to many in the trans community.  To say one is their biological gender regardless of their gender feels is considered hateful and potentially violent."
852,"Depending on the definitions you're working with such a person wouldn't even be trans. A man who wears make up and 'feminine' things isnt trans if he says hes still a man who just likes those things (as Bowie and any number of musicians). A man who hates his body isnt automatically trans. A man who hates his genitals and wishes he has a vulva isnt trans. What makes a person trans is BELIEVING that they are a woman ""on the inside"" and that particular feeling or behaviors are evidence of that.

Miranda Yardley is a transsexual male (a man who had surgery to feminize his body including genital reconstruction) who now acknowledges that he is and always has been a man and that claiming to be a woman in any way is sexist and harmful. He speaks out on this a lot. He wears make up and wears his hair long but doesnt claim that he is ""socially presenting as a woman"" because that would be extremely sexist. He does NOT claim to be transgender and isnt considered to be transgender by the TQIA community. He uses ""transsexual"" to refer to the state of his male body."
853,"That would be fine.

I don't think the women here deny gender dysphoria exists and is a real problem. The problem is that this idea is now getting pushback because people think it's regressive and bigoted, as it's basically seeing being trans as a mental illness (which.....it is. Maybe the real problem is just the stigmatization of mental illnesses--at least in my pov that's a larger issue here. Not all mental illness is ""bad."" It's just not the norm.)

The problem is the definition of what 'trans' means is changing from dysphoria to an innate 'identity' that's affecting the legal system."
854,"Other kinds of dysphoria also exist, such as body integrity dysphoria. Personally, I'm not against body modification (well, maybe limb amputations are too much haha) so if a man wants bigger breasts, be my guest. But it doesn't make him a woman."
855,"They are still men and belong in men's spaces. Trans is just a title that means nothing because they still aren't actually transitioning to anything.

And honestly Blair White's reason for gender dysphoria is bullshit. That he has a female brain and all. Dude is just a self-hating gay man."
856,"There are, but they are few and far between. They belong to a few Facebook groups I‚Äôm in and I totally respect them. I also feel bad for them because the 95 percent of TIMs who are psychotic absolutely harass them."
857,"That's what transsexuals were like back in the 80's. There are several TIMs today like that (mostly HSTS like Blaire White) but they're called ""truscum"" (not kidding) by the community at large and they're banished from neo-lefty spaces."

And ofcourse attention seeking behavior- it‚Äôs a handy way to try to guilt actual women in to feeling for you and convince them that you are sincere about being or wanting to be a woman, if that makes sense. 

If it were possible for them to carry a pregnancy, most wouldn‚Äôt pursue it because they don‚Äôt actually want that, they just get off on the idea. 
The ones that would go through with it (again if this were possible) would be in for a rude awakening- and not just because of the physical aspect of it, but the primary caregiver part. They cannot conceive of that it‚Äôs actually like to a woman, much less wrap their male socialized brains around that aspect of the female experience."

878,"As far as body modifications go, I think there's an ethical problem for a medical professional.  I believe the bioethic ""first, do no harm"" or the Hippocratic Oath's version, ""to abstain from doing harm"" challenges the ethics of performing unnecessary procedures.  

There are cases where the lack of a cosmetic procedure may have a significant negative impact on a person's life, such as in the case of burn victims.

But breast augmentation is a great example of my point given the frequent and terrible side effects experienced by many patients.  Even in ideal circumstances, best practices would have future surgeries down the line as no implant is made to last for life."

The expert said her salon‚Äôs refusal to provide sexual services has resulted in name calling, intimidation and customer requests to masturbate in her salon.

Even at this late stage, it is periodically still *shocking* to me, how gross many men are. Just... damn.

Not nearly enough, honestly. They should have figured out how much income the women lost(especially Ms Benipal whose business closed) and then given that pervert a bill.

I want to believe this will set a precedent. But, sadly, it seems that Canadian and other left wing news outlets are just scrambling to bury this story. They're praying that Yaniv just goes away so they can continue to pretend that all TiMs are asexual, harmless angels and that the threat of straight ""cis"" men using the trans label as a trojan horse is a bigoted conspiracy theory"
922,">Ms. Yaniv argues that a brazilian wax is the removal of hair between the belly button and the anus, regardless of the genitals involved. The Represented Respondents argued that a brazilian wax is a commonly understood industry term which refers to the removal of hair in this region of a person with a vulva. They distinguish it from a ‚Äúbrozilian‚Äù or ‚Äúmanzilian‚Äù, which is the removal of all hair in this region from a person with a scrotum. Ms. Yaniv strongly objects to these terms on the basis that she is a woman and not a ‚Äúbro‚Äù or a ‚Äúman‚Äù.

> She says that it is common industry practice for certain businesses to restrict their services to ‚Äúwomen‚Äù (meaning persons with a vulva) or ‚Äúmen‚Äù (meaning persons with a penis and scrotum).

Have scanned through the decision though, and the reasoning in the arm and leg waxing section is awful - no consideration for the vulnerability of the women offering the service or that they may not want to visit the home of a strange man. If not for Yaniv's abhorrent behaviour, it looks like the tribunal would have found against those two women.

And of course the decision is peppered with gems like ""a person with a vulva"" and ""I have explained that the Respondents‚Äô assumption that she was a man, even if it was wrong"", etc."

968,"Can Canadians confirm something - my impression is that sex is not a protected characteristic under Canadian law, is that correct? The judgement seems to find in favour of the women because Yaniv was motivated by racism and because their religion prohibits them from touching men.

Whilst I'm glad that these women won, the way they won seems a dangerous precedent as it states that it's specifically because he wanted a genital wax rather than an arm or leg wax that they were right to refuse him. So essentially it seems to be saying both a) a white atheist woman would have lost this case and b) women working from home have no right to refuse male clients for non-intimate wax services."

1004,Their expert is spot on. This is actually something that was covered in my cosmetology school instruction and we were informed that if we were not comfortable we were not obligated to learn to do it because it is difficult to do and the risk of creeps is high. Just in case anyone is questioning this quote and whether this shit is really that common.
1005,"I used to wax both men and women. Every man who had genital waxing got an erection. 100%. Most were embarrassed about it and really apologetic, and there are ways as a professional to mitigate it (such as draping). You also typically have the man assist whilst you wax (to hold the skin taut - think scrotal skin); to have them ‚Äòhandle‚Äô their junk when it‚Äôs erect. 

Mostly, getting an erection was an automatic response to being touched. They do not last long, especially once the pain starts (don‚Äôt want it to seem as if men have them the entire appointment). 

It was not uncommon for a man to try to request more, or to suss out whether you‚Äôd offer more. Usually they tried to be subtle about it (they weren‚Äôt), but some outright asked, or just started talking sexually. They never tried this at the beginning of the appointment, all asked whilst well into the waxing. 

I once had an old guy start commenting on how he loved hot wax dripped on his balls. 

Some men outright begged you to ‚Äòfinish them off‚Äô, and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs always the creepy, feral men. I had many extremely attractive men hint or blatantly ask for sexual services. You have to presume that many of these men were partnered.

Didn‚Äôt matter whether the salon was highly reputable, or a suburban corner shop, both ends of the spectrum experienced unwanted sexual conduct from men. 

Unfortunately, if you‚Äôre going to offer intimate waxing for men you must have policies in place to handle these situations as they WILL occur."
1006,">estheticians who are not trained in male genital waxing should not attempt to wax a penis and scrotum due to the risk of serious injury to the customer

That almost makes me feel a little disappointed that the women didn't give him the waxing he demanded.  Almost."
1007,That‚Äôs not how the Human Rights Tribunal works. You‚Äôre thinking of how they would calculate damages in a civil action
1008,that's ridiculously small. insultingly small. it doesn't cover legal fees never mind loss of business!

1010,"> Not that I expect it'd get paid, but Yaniv's benefits and paypal donations being garnished for years to come would be a strong message.

This is foolish, but I actually can't decide which outcome would make me more angry: Yaniv writing a $6,000 cheque like it was no big deal and waltzing away from this whole mess . . . or the women never collecting because he's broke."
1011,Yanniv is such an absolute piece of shit.
1012,Keep in mind that this was just *one* of the businesses Yaniv went after.  He pulled this scam at a dozen other places - working the system and suing people for not waxing his genitals was a business for him.

1020,">Ms. Yaniv strongly objects to these terms on the basis that she is a woman and not a ‚Äúbro‚Äù or a ‚Äúman‚Äù.

Women aren't bras, but okay.

This seems more satirical than actual satire."
1021,"Whenever I bring the Yaniv story up to TRAs and their handmaidens, they either say, *""but he's not REALLY trans""* or *""you can't judge all trans-women based on one bad person! You wouldn't judge all women because one female did something evil, would you!?""*

&#x200B;

They don't seem to understand that the trans inclusive laws they champion are exactly what empowered Yaniv to use the Canadian government to punish immigrant women for the ""crime"" of refusing to touch his genitals. And that he used the Protected Class status of trans-women to evade punishment/judgement for doing shit that would have landed anyone else in jail. It doesn't matter if 99% of TiMs are saints. The point still stands that these laws empower shady men to do exactly what Yaniv did; and that problem needs to be acknowledged and addressed.

Yaniv is only catching heat for this because his Lady LARP is so cartoonishly pervy and gross that even hardcore activists like Morgane Oger had to publicly distance themselves from him. Can you imagine how many AGPs are pulling similar shit and we're just not hearing about it because those other men aren't total morons who broadcast every creepy thing they do like Yaniv does?"
1022,"> If not for Yaniv's abhorrent behaviour, it looks like the tribunal would have found against those two women.

This is a ***VERY*** good point. 

I honestly believe that the only reason Yaniv lost this case was because he's a cartoonishly creepy freak who broadcasted his intentions to screw over immigrant women, blatantly lied in court, has a documented history of sexually predatory behavior, attracted international attention/embarrassment with his antics, and basically embodies every negative stereotype of an AGP we can think of.

If Yaniv wasn't a total moron who left receipts of his bad behavior all over the internet; he probably would have won this case."
1023,It was his racism and him getting permanently documented on places like the farms that sunk him. Not so much the sexism underlying his behavior. And that makes me uncomfortable.
1024,"However, /r/Tranada was pretty quick to remove my link to this article"
1025,"only kind of. it‚Äôs because Yaniv is just so mind-bogglingly bad at his hobby of harassing women and girls (and also, it appears, because of the use of clear language in defining certain services). if he had the barest hint of skill at dissembling or covering his tracks, we‚Äôd be reading a different decision.

this should stand as a sort of caution sign, I think. *attention: you ladies got lucky.* next time, there will be a skilled and sympathetic manipulator. no one will have thought they needed to specify who they meant (or itemize body parts) when they said ‚Äúwomen.‚Äù they‚Äôll learn that ignorance of the new language, which they didn‚Äôt even realize they were speaking, is no excuse."

They seem to be suspiciously  right leaning.

1044,"Actually, sex is protected under BC human rights law, which is why VRR won their supreme court rulings against Nixon. I think it's less clear in federal human rights law though and the 'trend' is to protect gender ID above all else including race and religion so even if sex is explicitly written into BC human rights law it doesn't mean sex-based rights will actually be protected.   


Then again the HRT has an agenda but the actual supreme court of BC is less likely to put up with this kind of silliness since they need to act more like a real court and Yaniv would've been found in contempt of court a long time ago if it weren't the HRT."
1045,They claim Yaniv is not actually trans
1046,It's kind of a busy news day.
1047,">I feel like it‚Äôs not yet okay for any form of trans people to fully accept their identities. Society still wants them to live within norms. Should not someone who identifies as female get a service from someone who identifies as a person who touches female genitals for a job?

>How was this ever a question?

>When  did we get to a point that someone had to actually decide that a person  could not be compelled to touch someone else's genitals?

Yaniv was able to do this because he claimed genital waxing was necessary ""gender affirming care"". So these salon workers were literally killing his inner woman by refusing to give him a ""lady wax"". 

&#x200B;

Never mind the fact that the VAST majority of actual females never get a genital wax (so it's not needed for any dude's Lady LARP). And never mind the fact that these workers typically have the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason such as hygiene, rude behavior, etc. If a man in a dress wants a cosmetic service, suddenly it becomes as vital as cancer treatment and anyone who refuses to do it is a monster."
1051,"When trans cult started gaslighting everyone that if he's now a woman, then every  part  of his body is now female, too (hence, girldick and girlballsack are no different to the vulva, just shaped differently.)

At least this negated the concept of girldick. Now, to apply this to gym lockers, spas, etc."

I think it's actually a good thing for everyone to see that blatant bollocks and grievance claims without substance actually face pushback from normal people.

Frankly I don't really know much about what has happened here. But I will say that there seems to be, and have been for some years now, increasing resistance to the idea that absolutely anything can be imposed upon a third party due to nothing more than self_identification.

I think this yaniv person has other issues as well, but maybe it was good that someone so blatantly over the top actually got told to sit the fuck down and stop imposing their personal insanity on their community.

I‚Äôve heard from nurses and a friend, who needed a catheter due to rhabdomyolysis, that hitting the top of the head as hard as is reasonable also makes the erection and unwanted sexual arousal (which my straight friend claims he got as a natural reaction to the male and female nurses touching his part) go away immediately. I suppose waxing could also cause enough pain to make that go away quickly. On a more serious note, it‚Äôs a shame that there are so many males out there who think that an erection means they absolutely need to get off."
1059,I don't know how you could stand it. Ugh.

People who supported the estheticians here are not trying to ban people from providing services to ""transgender"" customers.  It is not about that.  They can if they want to.  Just as these women can choose not to wax male reproductive organs.  How do these ""trans rights"" people make the leap from ""respect"" and ""validation"" to overriding the rights of others?

1101,I think by now my face is permanently frozen with that expression.

Most of them are also pleasant, courteous and ‚Äònice‚Äô, so when they unexpectedly ask if you do extras (after the 5 visit, the 20th...) or want to hear my ‚Äòhorror stories‚Äô of men overstepping the bounds (which is them simply testing the waters to see where my boundaries are and what they could possibly get away with), it‚Äôs an extremely uncomfortable and unexpected situation.

It‚Äôs not as if I hadn‚Äôt been exposed to the piggery of men before, but working in these environments filled me with a new level of disgust.

LARP is an old nerd term meaning ""live action role play"". It mainly refers to people who wear costumes, get together with their friends, and act out their Dungeons&Dragons personas.

Forcing a business owner to allow transwomen into the women's bathroom is actively forcing them to accept the belief that a transwoman is a biological woman or other similar beliefs that you may not agree with.

Gay people want to be free to do what they want. They aren't asking everyone to be forced to make special accommodations for them."

I object to the idea that it should be considered ""considerate of one's partner"" to get all one's pubic hair ripped out - if people want it done, I'm not stopping them, but this kind of rhetoric normalizing procedures which are potentially dangerous, unnecessary, and fueled by porn isnt productive."

1157,"The problem with that specific scenario, the baker, was that they not only walked into a bakery that it was very clear they were Christian-oriented, the couple ended up trying to doxx said baker. 

Anyone in the LGB community who knows that story and all its details will tell you that they vehemently disagreed with what the couple did to that business and it‚Äôs completely the opposite of everything we stand for... no self-respecting homosexual couple would ever give their money to a business that is vocally against homosexual couples being married; it was specifically to harass these people."
1158,"the supreme court ruling was extremely limited. it primarily ruled on whether the previous court had given an unbiased judgement, and used statements made by the court that suggested they had discriminated against the bakery on basis of religion.

some of the justices did pen secondary opinions that a custom wedding cake is a form of art - since you have to design it - and thus, forcing the bakers to create art celebrating a gay marriage was coercing them to express something they did not believe in. it's been a while since i read the case, so i don't remember all the details, but i believe the bakery offered to sell them a premade wedding cake instead of a custom one, further delineating between 'refusing service' and 'refusing to create art.'"

1162,">Didn't the baker win their case?

Eventually, after having to take it to the US supreme court. But in this situation, both the Colorado courts and the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (CCRC) most certainly attempted to impose requirements on another group. Both the initial ruling and the appeal in Colorado was in favor of the plaintiffs. From the wiki article:

 *The case was decided in favor of the plaintiffs; the cake shop was ordered not only to provide cakes to same-sex marriages, but to ""change its company policies, provide 'comprehensive staff training' regarding public accommodations discrimination, and provide quarterly reports for the next two years regarding steps it has taken to come into compliance and whether it has turned away any prospective customers.""* 

Worryingly (in my opinion), SCOTUS did NOT rule that the baker had a right to refuse to create a custom wedding cake for these two gentlemen's wedding. (For what it's worth, the baker never refused to *sell* the couple a cake. He refused to make them a custom cake.) They simply reversed the original rulings based on the CCRC's blatant hostility to the baker's Christianity, which they stated violated his first amendment rights. This leaves the door open for further attempts by woke organizations like the CCRC to impose its ideologies on private citizens. 

As an aside, after SCOTUS's ruling, the CCRC decided to drop a second case against this baker, which they had brought after he refused to make a custom cake for a TIM to celebrate his transition.

&#x200B;

> Denying a service to someone because they have a different religious beliefs than you is different than forcing others to police their language, deny sex based protections and touch their genitals. 

I'm not arguing that the two cases or situations are all that similar. I was simply arguing against Kabloona's statement that legalization of gay marriage does/did not impose requirements on other groups. Because there were and are quite a few organizations who are using gay marriage to do just that. Gay marriage isn't the problem. I don't even think liberalism is the problem here. It's identity politics and how it fucks us all. It takes anything regarded as ""minority"" and tries to force all of us to worship at its frequently cock-shaped altar.

All that being said, I'd argue that it's beyond absurd that either of these cases were ever even in front of a court. The country of Canada needs a judge to rule that women should not be compelled to touch a man's penis. This is fucking crazy. The US *couldn't even get a court to rule* that a local small time baker can't be forced to bake a cake for a function he doesn't agree with. Not as crazy, but pretty fucking crazy."

The hat's allusion to the [vulva] also ignores the fact that some transgender women opt against undergoing gender-affirmation surgery.

In fact, he explained, ""A lot of the reasons [transgender women] are attacked is because they do not possess that piece of anatomy.""

What exactly does this have to do with this thread? It looks like a politer version of ""what about the men"".

Edit: you seem to be focusing on the ""be nice"" part of the opening post. This is a Radical Feminist sub. We are trying to free women  from exploitation and oppression. You don't do that by telling women to be nice to everyone."
1326,They already embrace their emotions and have been doing so forever. It's a bit much at times. I kind of wish they'd just grow up instead of hoping people (particularly women they want relationships with) will accept them as overgrown children. Nobody cares when a woman breaks down due to constant emotion abuse and harrassment and unfair treatment and I don't see that changing in the near future.

And who do you think is more likely to have to do the laundry when they get home?"
1331,"What are you TALKING about? This quote refers to the labor of social movements. Not coal mining.

But I do love how anti-feminists ALWAYS be like ""coal mining...derp!""

Who do you think worked in all those textile factories and would get injured by those machines until labor became a movement? Who fucking DIED in the triangle waist coat debacle? And who do you think did back breaking labor in the fields right alongside their husbands and sons?

And women did try and succeeded in working underground in coal mines - despite being BARRED in many places by men. So, even if women could work the mines men banned them. Or, if they weren't outright banned, they sexually harassed, raped, not taught safety regulations by men so the women would get injured...""Women in Coal Mining West Virginia"" is a Medium article that talks all about how those noble male coal miners treated their female coworkers.

Women do and have always done physical labor. I am sick of this crap that women always have had it safe and easy."
1332,"I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything feminist about the Dove commercial. I‚Äôm not a fan of the actual body positivity movement either as it is because imo they‚Äôre just trying to broaden the scope of women eligible to be objectified instead of assuming objectification itself is the problem.

1333,Yup. When you try to fix everyone's problems no one's problems get fixed.
1334,"I think it's a feminist issue because more women are poor, single parents, etc. than men.

1335,">When you take on every issue, you have no real movement. It's just rights for all. That isn't a bad position to take, but it's not a feminist issue.

Exactly....  women should care about other issues, but as individuals with the men being involved, like climate issue, racism etc etc, not water down feminist issues."
1336,"That's why people who try to take advantage of the feminist movement to push their own cause piss me off. I've see some animal activists/vegans argue that saving animals from being eaten is feminist and they gave as example that cows are females like us and mothers and their lives are as valuable as ours üòê.

I may not agree with a female on reproductive choice issues but I'll be damned if I sell out her opinion in front of a man or allow him to berate her for hers.

What if some women don't care if they're beautiful and if men find them beautiful ? What if they don't give much thought about their appearance bc it's not in their personalities?

I've also had body hate for some of my features like my nose bc i was heavily bullied on it.

That is an absolutely ridiculous situation and I do not know why you were forced into the position of leaving. It's a Halloween party and costumes are part of it.

You were exactly right to speak up for yourself. And you didn't hurt anyone with your costume. You simply ran afoul of a spiritually and psychically small man who sought to control you and everyone around him. They allowed you to become the scapegoat for this guy - that's the real outrage. 

I hope you don't encounter any more harassment from this individual, but you probably will. Once they get rolling they tend to keep going."
1425,"Lawyer up. If a male would have been allowed to wear that costume then you should be allowed to wear it. Offensive costumes are always offensive no matter the sex of the person wearing it.

Speak to a human rights lawyer (ACLU in the USA or the HRC in Canada) about being asked to leave a work party because you were wearing a cross-sex costume when there were two men there also in cross-sex costumes. Don't mention the trans woman. Mention HR only. Let HR argue their reasons.

1428,"If something like this happens to you again, my suggestion is to demand that HR put their demands about the clothes you're wearing in writing with the HR officer's signature on it. The opportunity to do that in the heat of the moment has passed, but you might still try to get HR to clarify in writing what exactly you did wrong and what exactly their ""logic"" was in asking you to leave. Don't even bring the powertripping misogynistic TIM into this discussion. Make it clear that you don't understand what *HR* wants from you and you need clarification of it. If they blow it off and say you didn't have to leave (they were already trying to walk it back the night of), you still should try to make them put their reasoning for the request for your ""voluntary"" exit in writing.

TIMs are misogynistic powertrippers, so there's really no use in trying to fight this guy, especially since anyone with any power in the company will take his side. This issue is about HR discriminating against you on behalf of a misogynist coworker. The legal responsibility falls on HR, which means it's up to them to tell the TIM to pound sand. Your job, if you choose to accept it, is to make them fulfill their responsibility to you.

Also, don't bring up lawyers or lawsuits if you can help it. Try to get them to write this down so you can use it as evidence later if necessary. They won't do this if they think you're going to sue them."

1431,"Oh, so it wasn't possible you were a TIF then (transman) ?? Cuz some how you had privilege?

 If you can file a complaint about that whole debacle... you were asked to leave because you dressed how you wanted which was no way inappropriate and made to feel like you were abusing someone else. (Edit: I see you are uncomfortable with that.)

You were wearing something that women worked hard for to get the right to wear. By saying that you wearing that makes a transwo(man) uncomfortable and asking you to leave is reinforcing sex stereotypes and is absolute bullshit.

Males reinforcing gender/sex stereotypes. How--What's the word? Right. progressive."

Interesting how the MAN afforded that courtesy to the MEN, but did not consider that maybe you had trans feelings but weren't ready to come out, and it's not her place to tell you what to wear.

Of course, this has everything to do with the fact that he knows if he complained to the men, they'd tell him to fuck off and might even laugh at him... but he feels that he has power over a woman, that his complaints might succeed with her, and that he won't face pushback for going after her.

> There's another party a friend is having tonight, but I don't know if I even want to go because I don't want to upset trans people.

Well, guess what dude, based on your insane definition of gender, I'm gender-fluid so back the frack off.

Let them enjoy their night and don't be hypocrital because why would she consider the guys who dressed up as female characters to be having 'trans feelings' and not you? If that's her reasoning then by all means you could be having 'trans feelings' too and also not 'ready to come out'. 

People can wear what they want and just because you're dressed as a male, which you have every right to be, doesn't mean that it's wrong. Clothes are clothes and it's obvious Sarah is putting a lot of being female on clothes and femininity.  I mean have you ever looked at women who wear suits! For one thing that's super hot. But does that mean when she sees women wearing suits that every single time it triggers her because a suit is considered for 'maaaaaaales' ???? Like jfc.

1473,"There's a simple solution to it. Call trans women what they are:

Men.

I hate to sound like a white knight here, but the more we give way to compelled speech, the more they want to compel speech. It's an attack on women, their spaces, and their sports. Using the teeny percentage of abnormal gendered people as justification to make ridiculous claims about gender and sex is not a valid argument and many of the scientists are pushing their own agenda instead of abject truth. Your chromosomes and genes define your gender, and if this was a different mental illness, we wouldn't be enabling the delusion. Treat them with respect but don't give way to the wider ideology."
1474,"I am so sorry this happened to you.

This reminds me of a post (or multiple posts, I can't remember) a while back about makeup. Apparently lib fems were screeching that going without makeup and shaving can't be a feminist act because it ""excludes"" trans women, who need those things to ""pass.""

So basically now we have to undo all of feminism so that men can more easily pretend to be women.. and feminist women, at that. 

Cool, cool."

1478,I'm really sorry this happened to you.  Your costume sounds like it was super cool.
1479,"I think it's jealousy,  pure and simple. Your gender-bending costume was probably clever and got compliments.  If there's one thing we know about a large subset of TiMs, it's that they MUST be the center of attention,  and lavished with praise, else they throw tantrums and threaten people."
1480,"Next time tell HR you're identifying as a man for the evening. Its supposedly subjective horseshit anyways, so who is anyone to say any different?"
1481,"My blood is boiling even though this didn‚Äôt happen to me. I can imagine how it made you feel. This is harassment. It is! Being with a toxic person is like walking on eggshells. Every move, every little thing that might upset the toxic person becomes your fault and your responsibility. I find these people to be highly narcissistic. It‚Äôs all about them! Everything should be about them. 

If you study this personality, you‚Äôll understand the characteristics."
1482,"PLEASE don't call us ""cis""."
1483,You are not the asshole.. That sounds super shitty and I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. Women have enough men policing what we look like I would appreciate trans women being allies supporting us and not telling us we can‚Äôt dress masculine because it‚Äôs triggering.
1484,"I know this was removed from AITA, but I just have to say totally NTA. As far as race goes, I doubt it had anything to do with this guy's motivations, although I can't say with certainty. The bullying of natal (biological) women is very, *very* common with ""transwomen"". It's happened to you. It's happened to me. And I've read way too many accounts from others who have been bullied and shut down because the only feelings which matter are the transwomen's. I'm sorry this happened to you. It's unfortunately much too common and it's way worse than just things like this. Reddit is infamous for shutting people down if they're ""on the wrong side"". (Although it isn't wrong at all). A lot of them, or their sympathizers, have taken over as mods on subs and you can get banned for saying totally innocent things. Or correct things. Or for just having an opinion. The bullying is pretty bad and really bad in real life. If you read around some, you'll see what I mean. There are sooooo many accounts of things that are changing or have been changed which hurt all natal women very badly. Definitely take the legal advice which has already been posted here. It's very good advice."
1485,Sounds like an awesome costume. You‚Äôre right. Where does it end? Basically they want everyone to go back to the 1950s and live in sex role stereotypes. I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre seeking legal counsel.
1486,"It sounds like he‚Äôs jealous because you‚Äôre an attractive woman having a good time living your best life.

I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you.  Sue them."
1487,"So... definitely not the asshole, for one. For two- fuck your coworker (not literally) and fuck HR for even giving them any validation of their complaint. This entire situation is ridiculous. Glad you are talking to a lawyer- and welcome to gender critical! This sub has kind of saved Reddit for me and helped me feel less outcast for being a woman... who supports other women."
1488,"I am so glad you're seeing a lawyer. Your HR person was WRONG. Sarah was WRONG. This transwoman can feel whatever, but it is wrong to take those feelings and oppress another person. I can understand being asked to leave a party if you were dressed up like Hitler or something egregious, however you were just a woman dressed up as a fictional comic book villain. It wasn't even the evil villain that disturbed him, it was simply that you're a *woman*."
1489,I have nothing to add except this is crazy to me.
1490,"Holy shit, sue the pants off them while wearing pants ! HOLY SHIT !"
1491,""" if she were to dress as a male character people would doubt her womanhood because she's trans.'

""Sarah""....bless your heart.   People doubt your womanhood even when you're dressed as a woman.  Because you're a damn man.  Jesus.  Sorry, OP.  Bet you looked cute as hell, which rubbed salt in the wound.  Keep us posted on this insanity."
1492,What have we become as society? Your coworker is mentality ill. This is all about attention. Tine to plan a nuclear revenge. Don't accept this bs.
1493,I bet he is a ‚Äútransbian‚Äù too. They‚Äôre the incels that get triggered bc no one likes them in GIRL MODE either and make the real lgbt community look like shit.
1494,"I see on a pretty consistent basis that transwomen have a hell of a lot more privileges than ‚Äúcis female‚Äù women (a redundant phrase).  

I don‚Äôt mean privilege in just the sociological definition (which only means someone does not experience discrimination on a particular axis), but also in the sense that they get an unusual amount of special treatment. They are rarely expected to compromise, acquiesce, or face repercussions for inappropriate behavior. Your story is an all too common example, but there are a lot of egregious ones. 

Even other trans activists have said that Halloween is an opportunity for closeted people to safely experiment with their gender identity in public, so it‚Äôs best not to make assumptions about the intentions of cross dressers. How can they be sure you weren‚Äôt trying to explore being a trans man? That doesn‚Äôt mean I personally agree that it‚Äôs transphobic to cross dress for any other reason, but it‚Äôs pretty hypocritical of a trans person to police anyone else‚Äôs gender nonconformity. 

Anyway. Your coworker was 100% out of line. Their feelings are their responsibility alone, not yours or anyone else‚Äôs. You did nothing wrong, they were obligated to deal with their own discomfort without taking it out on you. If they couldn‚Äôt handle it like an adult, they should have left. 

It‚Äôs not the fault of cis women if a transwoman can‚Äôt pass, and it‚Äôs not our job to make sacrifices because they feel insecure about it. You don‚Äôt owe them anything more than the same basic courtesy you‚Äôd give to any other person. 

This applies to any well-adjusted adult in a professional setting, trans or not. Imagine going to HR and saying you want a co-worker to leave a Halloween party because she‚Äôs too attractive and it makes you feel insecure about your looks, or because she was talking about her recent engagement and it made you feel bad because you‚Äôre single. That‚Äôs how delusional and self-centered this person‚Äôs behavior sounds. It‚Äôs just that as a society we‚Äôre all so afraid of the extreme backlash that comes with alleged ‚Äútransphobia‚Äù that we‚Äôre conditioned to indulge their victim complex and constant need for attention."
1495,"Yes it's a very weird world we are living in. And it's getting weirder every day.

Fact 2019: only in very few particular situations people are being expected to foresee any hurt their totally normal actions would cause and they are expected to tweak their behavior.

On the other hand, there are situations where it's totally okay to say or ask things that actually might cause hurt to people but all everyone says is: well get over it.

I will tell you some examples I experienced.

It's totally okay to ask a woman why she doesn't have children. Not only is this a totally personal issue, you might actually hurt someone who is infertile.

It's totally okay to make certain comments about women's bodies. You might never mention her race or the fact that she's overweight. But go ahead and ask her what her shoe size is if she's tall. And if she's slim go ahead and tell her that she should eat something. All perfectly accepted and it happens on a regular basis for me.

so go ahead and invade a woman's privacy, comment on her body and life choices, but don't dare to have a funny costume at an event!"
1496,"This is eye opening and thank you for sharing. I am new to this too. Some corrected me in this community saying that cis is not an ok term. Straight people shouldn‚Äôt be a labeled forced to be used because it‚Äôs a term trans pple came up with. They get to self define, we should to. Not be labeled by another group. It‚Äôs hypocritical. I also YouTubed Ryan Dennis. That situation explains everything. Google it"
1497,They think they are better than normal women in **every** single way. Normal women are just obstacles and or rape-meat for them to dominate and replace.
1498,[deleted]
1499,"How ridiculous, I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you. It‚Äôs not right at all and I can‚Äôt believe they made you leave because of a costume. Yeah they may have said they ‚Äòcan‚Äôt make you leave‚Äô but who would want to hang around after being so obviously targeted like that? I would be telling everyone what happened if it were me."
1500,"Holy shit, that is absolutely batshit insane and I'm enraged on your behalf. That is absolutely NOT OK! What an entitled, narcissistic, petty fucking asshole. He had no right to do that to you. Please know that. You did NOTHING wrong."
1501,"‚ÄúI asked what she meant and Sarah told me that me being a woman and dressing as a man is triggering to her, because people still know I'm a woman, but if she were to dress as a male character people would doubt her womanhood because she's trans.‚Äù

But people don‚Äòt observe what sex you are at a glance and then discriminate against you accordingly, thinking that they do is really terve rhetoric. Sarah should examine her cissexist biases"
1502,"> I will be bringing this up with the lawyer.

Yep, that's exactly where you go from here. That's the only place you can go from here. How freaking dare ""Sarah"" treat you so dismissively. You were fine, and your costume was fine, and you did nothing ""transphobic"" whatsoever. ""Sarah"" was the overly sensitive bigot and needs to put some big boy panties on before going to any more parties."
1503,"Let's remember that ""Sarah"" and her crocodile tears is an adult human male with so much privileges he pushed you out because your costume was probably better than his. 

He's a liar, and a racist that's why he did this little spectacle to you. You are exactly right to question Sarah's own attitude towards your skin color since transgenders are often not the last being huge racists."
1504,"I just recently joined this sub and it breaks my heart to read what happened to you. I hope what ever happened during that Halloween party back fires at HR and that trans person. I cant believe that something like that would happen,  people are fucking crazy. I would say its totally ok to be selfish and put your feelings in front of someone else. Fuck that crazy ass person and HR. I hope they both get the boot. Stay strong!"
1505,I'm curious-- why was your post removed from the r/AITA? What was the reason they gave for removing it?
1506,"You know, I have to say that I have many times in my life gone off in distress. And I don't know that anyone has ever known about it. How is it that some people - if they are crying in the bathroom - are known to have been crying in the bathroom? And have someone want to help them? That has never happened to me! 

What I am trying to suggest in my ever so subtle way is that this person must have made a bit of a production of it."
1507,"\> I tried not to make it racial, but it felt like there was a racial element...  


There is certainly a racial element. You were told that according to intellectual frameworks of privilege that you, a black woman, were kicked out of a party for refusing to consider the actions of your privilege-informed actions upon the feelings of a white male."
1508,"OMFG, we have come to this stage in 2019. You are 100% correct to feel the way you do and I agree it was both racism and misogyny at play here. 

This trans identified male (please , never call them women, they will never be women) deliberately picked on you, a black women, to have you removed. My good guess it was his chance to malign you and have you removed so that he is can revel in his fake victim-hood. He used you and treated you terribly. He's a narcissist and a woman hater. I commend you for going to a lawyer. Good luck sister."
1509,"Really sorry this happened to you. Wow, I wouldn‚Äôt have known how to react at all!! If they were upset THEY should have left - the issue is theirs, not yours."
1510,This is sickening and I‚Äôm sorry this is happening to you. I hate that you have to pull the race card but whatever you can do to put Sarah in his place is very helpful!
1511,I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you. You did nothing wrong. Men who want to control women are using this as a new tool to control women. I hope you can work something out at work and get whatever redress you feel appropriate.
1512,"What in the actual fuck?!? I am so sorry they did this to you. It‚Äôs not only white supremacy, it is male entitlement, which trans women still have because they were socialized as men. I‚Äôm also a black woman and if I were you, I would be looking for a new job and making sure that I file a suit. Glad that you took the advice of people here and sought out a lawyer. The right lawyer will want to take on this case because it goes to the crux of not only sex-based discrimination but racism and employment. This is a Supreme Court case waiting to happen."
1513,"Tbqh it's not about the men here. The very fact that he felt entitled to demand you leave a party simply because your costume exposed his personal feelings of innadiquacy is insane.
Women in skimpy Halloween costumes who look hot as hell and rock them make me insecure because I know I could never pull it off, but I don't go around crying and screaming to HR about how these women should leave the building in order to make me feel better.
The sheer level of entitlement is appalling and frankly the HR lady needs to get a grip. She shouldn't have even enterteaned his bullshit."
1514,"TRAs say gender is a feeling, not how you look. Mental gymnastics"
1515,"You would not have been asked to leave the work party if you were male regardless of dress. That is sex discrimination ‚Äì workplace discrimination against a protected class. It creates a hostile environment in the workplace by excluding you from socialization and networking events and singling you out for behavioral policing.

&#x200B;

There is an added uncomfortable layer of black women's presentation (clothing, hair, etc.) being policed by white people in society. This still continues with black girls being kicked out of school for these things, when white girls and boys are not subject to those types of suspensions."
1516,"This sounds like sexist bullying to me, I can't believe you were asked to leave! This bloke is a horrible waste of space. I'd take it all the way to the top for discrimination, especially as they didn't request the other two blokes to leave. I'd say there is definitely a racial element to this considering you were the only one asked to leave. I wish you all the best my darling, and I'm so sorry that you've had to experience such awful discrimination over a fetishist's feeling. X"
1517,It‚Äôs clear why she only picked on you. You‚Äôre a woman and she thought you were an easy target.
1518,"That is infuriating!

 Didn't you know that \*her\* rights trump yours (it's misogyny, but we aren't allowed to say that out loud) ? And we must all acquiesce to the most sensitive and mentally imbalanced person in the room at all times?

The fact that you are black makes it more infuriating, because you don't get to choose your skin color while this person is actively choosing to marginalized themselves, play the victim role on top of it and make sure you know that \*her\* rights supersede yours."
1519,"> At that point HR told me she can't make me leave, but that Sarah had been crying in the bathroom earlier and that it would mean a lot if I just left for the night.

> So I said my goodbyes and left

That was your choice. Next time, just say something like, ""I'm sorry she feels that way, but I'm going back to the party."""

1521,(What is ‚ÄúAITA‚Äù?)
1522,"Yes, lawyer up immediately. You probably won't have any issues finding someone, but given this climate I'd be prepared for a lot of ""no's"".

You could always *try* contacting ACLU about this, but they take the trans side 100% of the time. Given the racial aspect, perhaps the local NAACP chapter in your area could point you to more resources?

I'm so sorry this happened. Your costume sounds amazing, save it for next year when you can celebrate without all this bullshit and baggage."
1523,you are NEVER the asshole for living your life without considering how males might feel about it.
1524,"Next time something like that happens, tell them to go fuck themselves. This is nothing more than an effort to remove women from public life.

Imagine if a cis woman said ‚ÄúI want her to leave because her hair is longer/stomach is flatter/legs are longer than mine.‚Äù she‚Äôd be laughed out of town. That‚Äôs basically what Sarah did. Doing a piss poor job of convincing people you‚Äôre ‚Äúreally‚Äù a woman trapped in the wrong body..."
1525,"God this is why Transpeople get a bad rep. Im a trans person myself and there was not a thing wrong with your costume.
If Sarah had such a problem with it,then she should have left,not you."
1526,"Wow, I'm so glad that you have support within the company, I think that'll make things easier for you hopefully. And yes, I do think your race definitely has something to do with it. TiMs love using statistics about discrimination towards black women to compare themselves to but then tend to be racist as hell on the inside (like Jonathan Yaniv) and single out nonwhite women with their bullshit. 

It's like with periods, they love using the topic to talk about their own ""oppression"" but when it comes to actually supporting women (i.e respecting how difficult actual periods can be, sexism crossing over with racism) they don't say a single god damn thing. Good luck with the case."
1527,"This is terrible and I'm sorry this happened to you. That transwomen picked the most outlandish reason to get you out of the party.  She choose the path of least  resistance - pick on a woman, and an attractive black woman at that. He could have done the same to the two men, but they tell him where to go - HR or not.  HR couldn't even figure out it was being fed BS. IF the transwoman was so upset, she should have left.  Watch your back."
1528,"The worst part about that story is 1. You bent the knee and left even though HR didnt force you to and 2. That at the end you decide that since youre black you should try to pull the race card on the tranny, the 1 upsmanship of victimhood is bullshit. Its why were having to deal with this shit in the first place"
1529,"White folx don't get to push black folx around. If we're going to use Tumblr's stupid spin on AAV.

How dare this asshole target you that way."
1530,Thanks!
1531,"Yea, the asshole is definitely the male who forced you to leave your Halloween party and made you cry. There isn't a single doubt about it. 

Also, this is a perfect example of the ""never happens"" kind of shit that is transgender lobbying."
1532,"Oh - you looked better than him, therefore he was ""triggered"". 100% guaranteed.

&#x200B;

Also this ""getting to determine what other girls can wear at the party so I can be the center of male attention!"" is a male fantasy of how women behave toward each other, I see it on tv all the time, I rarely see it IRL. TIMs acting out a fantasy of being Queen Bee."
1533,Soon they will replace us that's their goal..soon it will be offensive for existing in public because it effects the twanz. FFS. Drop the T like a rock.
1534,"What does cis mean exactly 

Sorry for being uninformed it‚Äôs just I‚Äôve never heard of that term before"
1535,"The question this kind of behavior always raises in my mind is, are all transgender identified males abusive assholes like this one or is it just the 80% who are co-morbind with narcissism?"
1536,"This is very common behavior from a transwoman, and the censorship is extra common.

I would complain to HR that you felt bullied that night, because you were. You were bullied by a man who hates and resents women."
1537,"Im so sorry this happened to you, it was racist and misogynist and shouldn't have ever happened. I hope you feel better now <3 sending love and solidarity"
1538,"HR should have just told her to man up!  


Oh. Wait. Yeah. No."
1539,It's time for a lawsuit.  Next it will be your job.  It's time to put a stop to this nonsense.
1540,Their argument is inconsistent.

1542,"Oh my fucking god. I just can't believe what people do anymore. Like what the fuck, women have cis priviledge to what, be oppressed? Do they even know what they're actually saying?

 And now people are pulling this shit too? What are we even supposed to do anymore? That was so unfair, I'm so sorry that happened. Ugh, I'm disgusted. I hope you get her in trouble so she doesn't get away with that. I swear, it feels like society is just regressing at this point, I am so freaking upset about this... you did nothing to deserve that, we just fucking exist and we get treatment we didn't ask for or deserve."

1558,"Controlling women's bodies IS a trans feeling, it would seem."
1559,This was my first thought. It‚Äôs not about trans feelings at all.
1560,"Well yeah, we men have been loosing our hold over women over the years so now we have to start identifying as women to exercise control over you."
1561,"I saw tweets like that, too... saying not to get mad at people crossdressing because they may be exploring their gender identities. WOMAN IS NOT A COSTUME!"
1562,Bingo
1563,"Fuck HR for enabling this nonsense. These people know they can get away with bullying as long as they paint themselves as a victim. Children do this shit with their parents.


Controlling women is a big part of the AGP fetish. Rod Fleming talks about this a lot in his research."
1564,Don't forget all of the men smashing women's records in sports.

Ugly misogynistic racist men feel threatened by happy confident black women  so women have to go to stop oppresing them"

1583,Women weren't allowed to wear pants on tv until the 1960s and now less than 60 years later we'd be back to not being allowed to wear 'men's' clothes? How anyone can think this is 'progressive' is beyond me.

1585,I'm a butch lesbian. So I guess my whole existence triggers transwomen.
1586,"I was gonna say ""under his eye"" and then thought about how the Handmaid's Tale sub is trans controlled - the irony!"
1587,"This is the logical conclusion of OP's altercation.  

Woman dressing like man = triggering because TIMs wouldn't be able to do so without presenting as masculine

means women must dress as feminine and revealing as possible in order to avoid triggering TIMs.  After all, most TIMs look like straight up men, so the only way to pass is by becoming a walking feminine stereotype.  If a woman wears pants or a long sleeve shirt, it reminds TIM of how if xhe wore the same thing, xhe would be perceived as a man.

All ciswomen are now required to come to work in thongs.  With breast implants and ass implants.  And corset training.  Men will support this."
1588,"That's what happened here, let's be honest. It wasn't allowed for a woman to wear men's clothes."
1589,Not ACLU.  They are 100 percent pro-trans right now.
1590,"Yes. I am a lawyer and I doubt I'm in your jurisdiction (or your country!) but this is such clear discrimination it's not even funny. But first things first - while it is all still fresh in your mind and before you start worrying about hiring a lawyer and before facts get overwhelmed by feelings (which can happen, and it's normal) you need to sit down and write out everything that happened that night, every little detail.

Where did you get dressed for the party? Were you alone or with other people? Describe your costume in *exact* detail (photos would be great.) How did you get to the party? What time did you arrive? Do you remember talking to specific people about your costume or anyone else's costumes? Write it all down. When did you notice the men dressed as female characters? What *exactly* where *they* wearing? How were they acting (i.e. were they just being themselves but in costume, or was 'Harley Quinn' acting like the female character Harley Quinn?) 

When did you first notice Sarah was present/when did he arrive? What time was it and what were you doing when Sarah and 'HR' pulled you aside to talk about your costume? Write out the conversation as best as you can remember it. Did anyone else hear the conversation? (If so, ask them to write down what they recall.) What was the tone of the conversation? 

>At that point HR told me she can't make me leave, but that Sarah had been crying in the bathroom earlier and that it would mean a lot if I just left for the night.  
>  
>So I said my goodbyes and left, but I cried in the Uber home.

All the details of this - what was the tone of 'it would mean a lot if you just left for the night?' Did you feel that some negative consequence (other than Sarah's feelings being hurt) would happen to you if you chose to stay? When you said your goodbyes and left, what did you say? Did any of your co-workers know why you were leaving? If they didn't, did they ask why you were leaving early? What did you say? Where was Sarah and ""HR"" while you were saying these goodbyes? What time did you leave? Ask your friends/co-workers who stayed at the party - when did the party end? What time did Sarah leave? How did she seem (mood, etc.) after you left? What time did the men dressed as women leave? **This part is important -** were any work projects, upcoming work social events, or other important work-related conversations you would have been part of had you been able to stay talked about at the party after you left? (This is where damages start applying.)

*Why* did you cry on the way home? Was it just because you had been looking forward to the party, was it because it felt unfair, was it because you hadn't meant to hurt anyone's feelings, was it because you didn't feel you got to state your side of things, was it because the cross-dressing men could stay, was it because you felt accused of transphobia or being disrespectful/hurtful when that wasn't the case, was it because you were worried about the consequences with HR going forward, or some combination of these (or other) things? 

Write down everything you remember, times, people, transport modes, everything, and if you have co-operative coworkers, let them help. 

Your next step should be to write a simple email to HR. *You need to write a simple wording of events that is basically impossible for them to deny.* Leave out details they could say didn't happen or are exaggerations - just the simple truth. 

This is an example, but it might not be right for you (include *only* facts they cannot deny or 'spin,' even better if you can name witnesses who heard the conversation or saw you forced to leave.)

'I am writing re: the events of the evening of (party date), when \[HR person\] told me it was best for me to leave the company party because my costume was upsetting to another co-worker, Sarah, because I was a 'cis woman' dressed as a male character. This happened even after I explained that my costume was simply a favourite character of mine, that I did not intend to hurt anyone's feelings, and after I pointed out that two men at the party were dressed as female characters. Those men were *not* asked to leave. This incident was distressing to me, and I would like to put it on the record. I have testimony from two other co-workers who \[heard the discussion where I was asked to leave, saw me leaving the party in tears, whatever is true.\] If you do not agree with my accounting of this event, I would appreciate a detailed reply indicating exactly where you feel my recollection, and the recollection of my co-workers, is not accurate.""

This will put them on notice that you're thinking lawsuit, so be careful, but make it airtight and basically impossible for them to deny. It should only be a few sentences long (your detailed write-up of the night may be pages long - keep that for *your* lawyer, don't show it to HR.)

Don't start looking for a lawyer until you have written out every detail you remember, quietly enquired if any co-workers can vouch for any of what you're saying occurred (I mean *any* of it - even if someone just remembers you left suddenly and unexpectedly, that's good, ask them to write down what they remember.) Then once you have your written statement, any corroborating statements, and a response from HR to your undeniable facts, go find that lawyer and *please* crucify your employer, because what happened to you is not okay. (I might think differently if the men in 'cross-dress' were also asked to leave, but they weren't? That's some bullshit right there.)"
1591,ACLU and HRC are both very pro-trans. Try find representation that will treat you fairly.
1592,"Yes, yes, yes! Legal advice pronto!

My mind raged upon reading this account. I immediately started rationalising the situation with regards to HR work policies for clothing etc. I know it‚Äôs confronting to be put on the spot in this scenario, but unless HR can show definitive documentation that clearly outlines where OP had contravened any said policy, it was completely unacceptable to suggest, even in an ‚Äòunofficial‚Äô capacity (and regardless of how oh, so politely it was couched) that she leave the party.

In this instance OP, YOU were clearly singled out and discriminated against. 

Be clear when recounting the reason they gave you for suggesting you leave. What language did they use and how did they use it? Was the reasoning they gave sound, with regards to your behaviour? The obvious answer is no. 

They kicked you out just to appease someone else‚Äôs sensibilities - someone you had zero direct contact with that night. Nobody else found your costume offensive up to that point, so don‚Äôt let them pull that card on you either. 

Remember OP to also highlight that you immediately tried to calmly resolve this issue and brought to their attention the blatant discrimination between your being asked to leave, and the verbal response you were given for why the cross-dressing men didn‚Äôt have to.

Was it even acceptable for a representative of HR to approach you in this casual manner? What‚Äôs the policy for this? It was essentially an ambush, for which you had zero time to prepare for, let alone accept. 

Good luck!"
1593,"Seconding the stay away from the ACLU opinion. They have fully drunk the trans Kool-Aid.

Step 1 is to document everything. OP should start a folder in her home. For each incident, jot down names, dates, places, witnesses, people she talked to after the fact, and copies of any key documents. Now that the TIM has had a taste of exercising shame and ostracism powers over a female coworker and HR has backed him up on it, the crybullying is going to ramp up. 

It won't necessarily be aimed at OP again, and probably not against 67-year-old Marie. But woe to McKenzie who sits next to the TIM and has the temerity to be pregnant in his presence, or Molly who needs extra accommodation for her endometriosis, or Megan who dares tell her work besties about her PCOS or TTC struggles.

Step 2 is for OP to pull out her employee handbook. Familiarize herself with company policy on reporting a hostile work environment incident. Even though the party wasn't typical 9-5 work, it's still corporate enough.

Step 3 is to make some tough choices about whether and how to actually report. 

If OP is going for a lawyer, she should look for a local plaintiff's employment discrimination lawyer. If she's in the US, it may be a little early to find a lawyer who will take the case on a no-money-up-front contingent fee, but it might be worth her time to seek an initial consultation on the hostile work environment. Just depends on how hungry the local sharks are.

If OP can't find a lawyer at this early phase - or she just doesn't want to - she needs to decide whether she wants to risk an internal corporate complaint. On the one hand, doing this promptly and by the book makes it harder for them to undermine her timing and motives if it ever does get to litigation. On the other, only OP has a sense of what kind of retaliation is likely to blowback on her for being 'difficult'.

In any event, OP should probably leave the GC/QT/TRA politics out of it. Unless her lawyer tells her otherwise, continue to play along with the TIM's pronouns, etc. For now, this is just about a double standard for male and female staff, and being singled out as 'inappropriate' with inadequate advance warning or justification."
1594,"Most especially, if non trans men were not chastised for crossdressing and you were, that's an issue."
1595,"I agree, please listen to the advice here and lawyer up. Ignore the window dressing this wannabe victim (aggressor) is trying to pull, this was discrimination against YOU. You have been discriminated against for being woman wearing an outfit that I'm sure is up to code with your company's written standards."
1596,Good advice.
1597,Agree! This is sexism in the workplace at its core.
1598,Good call. Make the company explain the reason was all over some crybully TIM.
1599,"HR is all about protecting the company from lawsuits, and whether OP brings up a lawyer or not, HR is a legalistic entity and knows that putting anything in writing can hold them accountable later.  I think this could go one of two ways:  1) HR could try to pretend like this never happened and OP will have a hard time getting them to put anything at all in writing, or 2) HR will clarify in writing that they are 100 percent pro trans and anti woman, and all women at the company are officially on notice."
1600,This is an excellent suggestion!  Ask for clarification in writing OP!
1601,"For real, how do some of these people make it out of the house in the morning?

If a client comes in and it's a woman in ""male"" clothes, is Sarah going to run and cry in the bathroom, and get HR to ask the person to leave? 

I wonder if trans people have employment problems because this is how they act in the workplace and ain't nobody got time for that."
1602,"Genderfluid exists in the trans community - I was a non-binary who presented as GF for two years before I became GC - the fact that this was never seen as a possibility (and the confrontation, if it WERE true that you were GF, would have forced you to out yourself, whether or not you were comfortable/ ready/ willing) is nothing short of erasure. Again, this is straightforward misogynoir and has absolutely nothing to do with being trans."
1603,"It's practically rehearsed. Some people love to imagine scenarios where they can tell someone off perfectly in a fight they were just itching to get into and so they memorize what they'll say in case the opportunity arises. This person knew who to target since OP did back down. Frankly, if it were me, I wouldn't entertain whatever bullshit that was being spewed from their mouth"

1615,"I did get this feeling, even from the HR lady. The way she spoke to me sounded like she wanted me to pity Sarah because Sarah was jealous of me or something.

To be honest the HR girl sounded like she knew it was ridiculous but she didn‚Äôt want to get in trouble herself, like Sarah was gaslighting her into making me leave. It wasn‚Äôt spoken outright, but that‚Äôs the vibe I got. She (HR) even walked me out to my Uber and told me she was sorry."
1616,">He wants to be you. He hates you for being female, and feels entitled to ruin your night because he is spiraling

You, as a woman, were disposable. 

There was no downside to them sending you home. You weren't going to fight, and if you had fought your job would have been at risk, it wouldn't have been written off as ""men being men"".

The men were given the benefit of the doubt. ""Maybe they are experimenting with gender!""

What about you? Why did they think you weren't doing the same thing?

*Because it didn't matter to them if you were.*

Your also-male trans coworker was able to enjoy the rest of the evening knowing they had the power to get you sent away.

Y'all probably wont like to hear this, but a more right wing group might be a better fit to take this case should it proceed to litigation. As far as I know, no mainstream liberal/left-leaning organization with any shred of clout is going to risk pissing off the trans demographic right now.

&#x200B;

Trans issue aside, this was a clear example of sex discrimination. OP was held to a standard that her male co-workers were not simply because ONE person didn't like her costume.

If she loves facts and logic she should be able to understand that they keep this privilege to a big extent, even if they suddenly say they always felt like a woman. They don't even seem to understand what a woman really is.. she isn't what she wears or how she acts. Womanhood is not a costume."
1706,"Cis is supposed to mean your gender identity matches your body/ sex. But going by their own doctrine, assuming a person's gender identity is a bad thing. Therefore, assuming you're cis & have cis privilege, goes against gender ideology.... yet it happens all the time because rampant hypocrisy thrives in this movement.      

Gender pertains to roles, stereotypes, & expectations, that are nothing but a social construct, enforced by a patriarchal society. Gender has been a powerful tool used to oppress women -- by claiming we are ""cis"", they are claiming we are not only walking stereotypes, but that we willingly identify with our oppression... not very progressive is it?       

That's why gender identity is harmful. For it to exist, they expect a portion of people to fit into this narrow definition of what a man or woman is. We know no one does, so going by gender logic, everyone should technically be ""non binary"" or ""trans"", because no one is a walking stereotype.      

If everyone could qualify as having a different ""gender identity"" from their sex, then it shows why the whole concept is flawed. They choose to believe in these regressive sexist stereotypes, & tell people their body must be wrong, rather than seeing the problem is with having that mentality in the first place.

It becomes an ""everyone/anyone"" issue, just like getting the flu. Same for discrimination. Can't claim there's discrimination against women going on, if the employer doesn't show a pattern of doing that to all ""women"" (TIMS).      

Also can't fight against misogyny, when there's ""women"" (TIMS) arguing it doesn't affect them, or arguing they don't see a need for policies/ protections. It actually hits us from both sides, with ""men"" (TIFS) arguing against women too -- they're still being lumped in with women when it comes to some biological functions (even if people pay lip service), so their words are also weighed as women's words, because they insist on being included in those discussions about pregnancy, breastfeeding, menstruation, etc.      

They created an enormous problem, by confusing sex for gender. Because of TIMS & TIFS, biology that was only relevant to being a woman, has been made irrelevant (with this: not all women have xyz/ some men experience xyz)."

1739,"> The progressive stack in action. They would never dare suggest to send the TIM home. 

EXACTLY!

The logical solution would be to send the TiM home. If he's so delicate that something as simple as a woman dressing up as a male Batman villain causes him to run screaming to HR and cry ""DYSPHORIA!!"", than he's clearly too sensitive for Halloween.

&#x200B;

Also, as others have pointed out, where does this end? If this TiM can command HR to send a woman home for wearing a tuxedo to a party (without the makeup, most TwoFace costumes are just normal tuxedos), can he also send one home during a normal workday because she wore a ""masculine"" pantsuit to the office and it triggered him? What if a very butch woman comes to work there and seeing her go about her day in masculine clothes, no makeup, and short hair causes him to have a breakdown? Will HR then be compelled to tell the butch woman she's required to wear skirts and makeup to the office because it would make the trans person less sad? It's INSANE to allow one person to have this much power over their co-workers. 

&#x200B;

I can't help feeling just a little sorry for the HR rep in this story. I imagine HR was in a bind because, in this climate, if you say ""no"" to a transgender person (especially a TiM) or imply that they might be over reacting to something silly (like a goddam Halloween costume) you'll likely be in for a PR nightmare that could destroy your business. If the female OP took this to the media, she'd just be painted as a whiney feminist zealot and/or TERF"

Then email your story to yourself (and a trusted friend, or your mom or sister or whatever) so it's dated and timed. Then print it out, seal it in an envelope, mail it to yourself, and after you receive it in the mail keep it sealed - the postmark is your proof of when you wrote it (this is a common thing in copyright cases, it works just as well for 'witness testimony') You can unseal it in court or arbitration if it comes to that. 

If you know what happened, you can describe the timeline, and especially if you have any witnesses (if they heard the 'you should leave' conversation, amazing, but even if they just noticed you leaving suddenly and unexpectedly and remember the cross-dressing men staying on, that's damn good)  you are in a strong position and HR should be quaking in their boots... details, every little detail. We lawyers will jump on a case with contemporary accounts of what happened in detail... because we can win those, more often than not. I understand you're hurt and upset but write it all down, find any witnesses who can corroborate any part of what you're alleging, focus on getting the story down first before you start worrying about lawyers and all that... *the story is the case*. Your lawyer is only useful if they can interpret the story in terms of the law - if you have no clear story or a story that can be discredited? No case. Write it all down now, while it's fresh and you remember details. It could be more valuable than you could ever imagine."
1746,"Yes! The supreme court case is about a man identifying as a woman, therefore wanting the same dress code as women.

Even if the case is successful, all an employer needs to do is axe any ""woman"" dress codes & make a policy,  (for ex) that all employees need to wear neutral colored pants & a button up.      

Maybe that could be the silver lining -- some employers may stop requiring no makeup, heels, or dresses for women, so men can't sue them."

Basically, your body says 'I'm exhausted from the internal bullshit and can't deal with any external nonsense'. You literally, physically can't deal with crap anymore.

With regards to any professional environment I‚Äôm in, or if I‚Äôm making arrangements or resolving an issue with a professional service (i.e. a utility company), I take records of everything - time the call/conversation was made, name of person I spoke to, what was said in the conversation, is there a call number, did the other party advise they might be recording the conversation themselves etc. I myself go so far as to record conversations, but ALWAYS with the other persons approval or permission first! (it‚Äôs illegal to record without permission in differing jurisdictions). Generally, the burden of proof will always fall on to you if there is no other evidence.

Doing so, I‚Äôve had decisions made against me/my actions from years past overturned or abolished, and this includes fines or supposed multiple debts (which were proved to be incorrect). I could do this only because I keep detailed records. 

This may seem extreme, but how many times for instance, have people been verbally told something by a utility company only to receive a bill where you‚Äôve been charged for something outside of what you thought were agreed terms. If you contact them and challenge them on this, they typically claim ignorance or error, so bad luck for you. Recording the conversations you have with these people/companies (with permission) disallows them from negating ACTUAL statements they have made. You have proof of this.

1776,"Your husband is going to bankrupt you, and, as another commenter has mentioned, could very well be putting you in the position of paying him alimony and child support when you finally get fed up with all of this.

Once he becomes a ""stay at home wife/mother"", I know and you know and everyone here knows that you will continue to do 99 percent of the housework and child care while he studies and does his nails.

If you have another baby, he's going to breastfeed it and expose it to the cocktail of chemicals he's on to make lactation possible. If you don't approve, likely he'll do it behind your back.

Also, men don't have a good track record with paying back their wives when their wives work to put them through school. If he does manage to get through school and get a job (but knowing how TIMs like this operate, more likely he's trying to be a leech), you will see none of that money as his wife or as his ex-wife.

Lastly, is the trust fund just for you, as in he's not a beneficiary? This is your opportunity to get the hell out of this marriage, pay off your share of *his* debt, and make sure he doesn't get his grubby hands on the money *your* relative gave you."

>Honestly I was originally going to post this in relationships, or the sub for spouses of trans people, but a friend suggested here.

If I said ""Yeah you probably would have gotten shouted down."" that would be isolating behavior, which I absolutely don't want to do. Instead I'll say ""We have seen other people post in those subs in the past and they were shouted down."" If, however, you are seeking alternative points of view, their input may be valuable.

>(Like she wanted to jump straight to breastfeeding despite barely being into her transition; it was costly and not something, from our research, that would help our baby much if at all and would purely be for her benefit. In the end the cost made her agree to put the idea aside (but not without a lot of tears from both of us)).

Holy shit, yeah. I'm glad this fell through. Male bodies cannot make the breastmilk you would have needed for your babies health. While it's true that male humans can lactate, it is ABSOLUTELY not the same thing nutritionally speaking as the breastmilk of a mother. I'm sure you know this already, since you *are* a mom, but you have different ""milks"" based on how far you are from the baby's birth, and each stage of that milk is balanced in such a way as to keep the baby healthy and alive. It changes. Male milk doesn't.

Another critically important thing on the milk subject is that you produce sugars in your milk meant to feed your baby's symbiotic bacteria so they protect the baby from harmful outside bacteria (not the baby itself, your child actually can't digest or use those sugars when they're a newborn). Male milk can't do that either.

&#x200B;

>My wife is high maintenance. She gets to go to a nice salon for her hair care and waxing needs, she owns a dozen nice bras, she has a complicated skin routine, she gets to tan and get new clothes and owns way more shoes then I do.

&#x200B;

>She still gets home, eats dinner with us, *then hangs out in the kitchen with me and the kids while I do the dishes and clean up*. She tells me about her day. I like this part honestly, but I wish she would help because it would get done a lot faster if both of us were doing it.

Can't even be bothered to help you clean up and give you a chance to hang out with your children? That's shitty behavior. Again, this person doesn't get a pass just because they're trans.

I‚Äôll tell you what, though. *You* deserve to be loved. What this man is doing to you is not love.

This is an extremely abusive relationship. Your wife/husband/whatever the hell he wants to call himself or identify as (does not matter) is an abuser. His behavior is so entitled and selfish that it‚Äôs comical. How the hell can a grown ass adult think it‚Äôs even remotely acceptable to take advantage of his spouse like this? You are literally going without things you need (like BRAS) because he all of a sudden decided that he wanted to live out his fantasy of what a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is?

Everyone says this, but get a lawyer. Once you divorce that guy he is probably going to try and sue for custody and he is obviously not deserving of that. And for the love of god do NOT SHARE ANY OF YOUR TRUST MONEY WITH HIM. You‚Äôve got to protect yourself and you‚Äôve got to protect your kids, and money can give you a means of achieving that protection. I repeat, DO NOT GIVE THIS MAN ANY MONEY. 

Keep thinking about the welfare of your babies, too. This is not someone they should be around, and he likely hangs out with people that could potentially hurt them.

 It's very telling how your partner wants to experience ""motherhood "" when there have been daily opportunities to parent their children and refuse to do so. He wants a start over on your dime, haven't you given enough?  

It is not on you to validate him,  it's not your responsibility to sacrifice so he can feel whole,  your ONLY responsibilities are to yourself and children --kudos for finding the strength to do just that.

I'm sorry he happened to you."
1791,"This is so gross and extreme it almost looks fake.  


Your husband started transitioning while you were pregnant? That's really common. They cant stand someone else being the center of attention.  


Then he wanted to breastfeed? That's *sick.* As you said, it wouldn't do anything to benefit the baby, it's all about him getting what he wants. He wants to use your infant as a prop at best and a sex toy at worst. Then he cried over not being allowed to waste your very tight money on abusing your infant??  


Now he's driving you into debt for his vanity. He doesn't do his share of the childcare or housework.  


""I'm treated like the help"" That's what you are. You are not in a marriage and from the looks of it you never have been. You are his servant. Your life is only to support him.  


""A relative of mine left a trust fund to be given to me when I turn 30. That's in six months"" That's why he's still around. I was wondering, usually they transition while the wife is pregnant, and then once the baby is a toddler they start sleeping around and eventually ditch her to life a life of 'freedom' with their new trans friends. I was wondering why he was still around and here it is, he wants to live his life of freedom on your money. As soon as it goes in to your shared accounts he will be entitled to use it and he will. Divorce will take longer than 6 months. Find a way to delay this or immediately put it into a savings account in your name only that can't be touched for another few years. If you don't he will leave you broke with two kids, I guarantee it.  


Separate now, don't wait another day. Yes he has always been this selfish. No he will never change. You have never been in a marriage, you have been a prop in his fantasy life. A marriage is an equal partnership. You never had that. It sounds like you had a fucked up childhood and that damaged your expectations for what a relationship should be. Don't let your kids suffer the same way. Show them how a person respects themselves."
1792,"> My older brother has already received his inheritance and is fully willing to let me borrow as much as I need for a good lawyer. I didn't talk to him about why I was thinking about a divorce like I did with my sister, just that I was....I think he's probably better to talk about this with then my sister given as soon as I said ""lawyer"" he immediately offered to loan me the money without me even asking.

This alone says so much more than you might realize. To me, it says that even on the outside looking in, your brother knows something isn't right with your marriage even beyond the trans aspects. That your brother is, as a man, looking at the track record of your wife/husband and finding it lacking. The trans aspect of this situation is just the candy coating most people might see first, hiding the truth of the matter, which is that your wife/husband does not partake equally in homemaking, childrearing, or financially."
1793,"JFC reading that was exhausting, what more living it. The question that kept repeated popping in my mind was ""Why is she still with him??"" Not only is he an awful partner and father, but he's financially dragging you down with debt.

If I were in your shoes, I would lawyer up and divorce this guy ASAP especially considering the trust fund paying out in a few months. And if the trust fund pays out in a lump sum, read ASAP in bold and italics and discreetly consult a lawyer regarding how to maintain sole control over and benefit of it while you're married and while in the process of divorce. Think of your two children, goodness' sake. Fuck his schooling and his designer purse. Save that money for you and your kids post-divorce.

ETA: As others have mentioned, look into trans widows, start off with [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/itsafetish/comments/bhjv4n/a_trans_widows_story_repost/?st=juyy6hpr&sh=3c431489)"
1794,"document EVERYTHING. go through your calendars and emails and bank statements and collate that information historically and then going forward. make a diary of a paragraph or two every single day. one paragraph of money spent, how much and in what. one paragraph of chores done and children taken care of and by whom."
1795,"So basically you were a maid/therapist to an adult man playing dress up?

Girl, please ***get out.*** He doesn't care about you or your children. He is essentially (forgive my bluntness) dead weight."
1796,"You posted this to a gender critical forum. I think you know what advice we would give.

You don't need us to tell you to leave.

You already know you have to go.

I'm proud of you for finding the strength to leave this narcissist."
1797,"My husband and I went through some really rough times financially. One time he went to see some friends and they sent him home with some of their leftover pizza. We were living on food banks and had been eating rice and beans for days at that point. He could have eaten it himself and I'd have never known, but he drove home with the pizza and we split it 50/50. That's how it was with *everything* then, or we'd try to give the other person the better share.

I know I wouldn't want to go through life and raise kids with someone who isn't in it as a partner. And I'd wager that if you stick around and give him access to the trust fund, that money is going to be gone.

If you do decide to divorce, I'd recommend you speak to a lawyer and get your financial ducks in a row prior to broaching the topic with your spouse."
1798,"I never use Reddit and signed up just to respond to this, because I have a friend that went through this exact thing, and a few others that had to deal w the courts regarding custody/divorce/abuse:

PLEASE DO NOT underestimate your spouse. At all. Never assume you know how they will respond. This is hard to do because you feel you know them, but this an abusive, dangerously entitled, male. I would not put it past them to be dangerous or vidictive when told they cannot have what they want. You have kids, which they may see as a way to hurt or control you.

You're seeing the very best of their behavior right now because you have something they want- inheritance and a chance to play mommy. What's going to happen once they realize their meal ticket AND validation is leaving? *Hopefully nothing*, but it's best to plan for the very worst, because telling men NO brings out their rage. And telling a man NO that is entitled enough to ""play woman"" on your dime is likely to be even worse. 

In practical terms, this means planning quietly and making sure you have a safety plan in place. It may seem extreme, but if you can talk to a DV specialist about how to safely leave, you really should. It cannot hurt. 

Document EVERYTHING, and save every single text, phone call, email, everything. Get an app that records everything off your device. Write doen everything they have done that has been harmful. Never say or type anything that you wouldn't want read in court.

I know this sounds majorly paranoid, but I watched a few friends get trounced in court by (and lose custody to) abusers, because they tried to be conciliatory and reasonable. The abusers had every text, my friends did not. Even little things like being 10 min late a few times adds up when read to the court. 

Be a shark, even though you might want to be the bigger person, so you don't lose custody and end up paying this asshole support too. 

Also- you mentioned moving. It's ok to try to position yourself in the best possible place to win. I guarantee your spouce will take every advantage they can, and hes starting ahead of you. Do your homework and try to get the odds in your favor. I'm so happy you can get a lawyer because that will make all the difference.

I hope your separation, divorce, custody, and co-parenting goes smoothly. You deserve the best."
1799,"So sorry to hear this OP. I see many red flags in what you‚Äôve written, and also a lot of crappy feelings I‚Äôve had while in relationships with men. Like when they act like you‚Äôre the help and make no effort to include you in conversations, at your own house. You are clearly a strong woman who has stuff going for her. Your wife is lucky to have you, holding everything down. Tread carefully with therapy as many therapists are in the transcult and will fall for the pity parties and crocodile tears. Beware that it seems like your wife might be jealous of you, which is simply misogyny since he is jealous of the seemingly good things about being female and doesn‚Äôt know half of the negatives. This spending issue would have me extremely worried. If he wants fancy clothes maybe he could find a thrift store. IF I were you I would be doing anything to protect the oncoming assets for the benefit of your children, screw letting him blow it all. I was raised in a family with narcissistic traits, trust me, he will have no qualms spending it all on himself on shit he don‚Äôt need and leaving nothing for you and the kids. Please take care"
1800,"OP, I am so sorry you are dealing with such a selfish spouse who has gaslighted you in so many ways. Your story brought tears to my eyes, made me glad I'm divorced & long single, & called to my mind a question attributed to Dorothy Parker: what fresh hell is this?

I agree with all the other posters so far, but thought it might be helpful to add one point: It's not clear where you are from, but if you are from the USA, please be aware that states vary in how they view wealth inherited before as well as during a marriage. In some states, inherited wealth is included in community property; in other states, it's totally excluded. So depending on where you live, your spouse might not have a valid claim to/on your inheritance. A good lawyer can advise.

Also, there's no need to borrow money in order to consult a divorce or matrimonial lawyer. With top-flight matrimonial attorneys in the US, the first appointment & attendant advice is always free - & if it's not, the lawyer is probably an unethical shyster.  What's more, if you are coming into an inheritance in the foreseeable future, any decent divorce or matrimonial attorney will take you on (if you want) & bill you later.  They are accustomed to this.

I feel for you & wish you & your kids all the best."
1801,"I can't imagine someone like this ever improving. If someone is still that self absorbed and lazy after three children. My aunt's husband is like this. Just does as he pleases with money while expecting my aunt to penny pinch, makes everything about himself and what he needs out of life, barely contributes to family life, saps all the energy out of his wife and pouts and feels victimised if anyone gives him the slightest criticism. His desires are paramount and my auntie and cousins are just there to facilitate and support him. My aunt just made herself ever smaller to accommodate his massive ego."
1802,"He's a shitty male who's using you to live out his insane fantasy life. Leave him, sue for child support and don't look back."
1803,"*Dump that asshole already.*

Let's put this in gender-neutral terms: your partner is driving you into debt because they need money to maintain a certain image of themselves. Your partner prioritizes their own feelings over yours. Your partner's friends aren't kind to you. Your partner is making selfish plans with your family's money (presumably left to you because your relative loves *you* and wants *you* to get a little boost in security). You deserve so much better. 

And, in case anyone calls you a transphobe, please remember this: in the most charitable, pro-trans terms, transition is a lifelong medical, psychological, and physical journey. Your spouse, in other words, isn't going to stop wanting maternal experiences or a certain expensive aesthetic. You're doing the kind thing by letting them pursue that freely."
1804,"Oh honey.

I'm so sorry.

You need to leave, now. He's going to get his hands on that trust fund and drain it on irrelevant selfish bullshit. You need to take the children and go. **He will not change, he will only get worse.** He sees you as a prop in his fetishes. He sees you as a resource, not a person.

You need to leave. Find a man who treats you with respect. This is not respect. It barely sounds like love. You sound like an indentured servant."
1805,"Yes, you need to start your plan to leave now. With a lawyer.

He is incredibly selfish. He absolutely does not at all care about your feelings and needs - his take priority, even if that means pushing you back to work while still bleeding after childbirth so he does not feel upset about ‚Äúnot being able to be pregnant‚Äù. Oh and if he can‚Äôt take care of the kids on his own now, or help with housework, guarantee he will do shit all while staying home with a newborn. You will still be doing all the work, and he will be advocating for a nanny so he can go to the gym or the salon as he ‚Äúdeserves it‚Äù. Guaranteed.

And the audacity of him claiming what he is going to do with your trust fund. It‚Äôs gross. My husband and I believe in sharing but we never act entitled to gifts or inheritances (the small ones we have had). 

There is a good ‚Äútrans widows‚Äù thread(s) on Mumsnet in the Feminism/Women‚Äôs Rights forum. You may find it helpful support wise.

I am glad you posted here, and I really wish you the best - I promise you deserve a hell of a lot better than this."
1806,"Everyone is giving you advice that you expect and it is good advice, I want to touch on one additional point.  You referenced your brother being potentially better to talk to and it sounds like you are right.  What I want to emphausize is that you need an external support network, which is really tough for many people and may be tough for a single mom with two kids planning on going to school.  Recognize though that your wife is getting a support network from her new friends who are backing her narcissistic thinking and making all of this easier to enforce.  You need to be spending time with people who are going to back you and who are going to be pulling you away from trans cult talk and into rational lets treat people on their actions talk.  I can not give you good advice on how to find and maintain this network but your brother sounds like a good start and so I hope you do talk to him in this regard."
1807,"I dated a pre transition trans woman and he was just like this. He wanted to be a stay at home dad too, and said how great it would be to watch TV all day üôÑ. He couldn‚Äôt cook, wouldn‚Äôt clean, pretended to be broke and begged me to buy him things...then miraculously came up with the money himself when I refused. He didn‚Äôt want to be a woman, he wanted to be a spoilt trophy wife who never had to work, just lay around being told she was beautiful and given presents, despite being a pretty average looking man. He didn‚Äôt want any of the bad parts of being a woman and he told me I should agree with him all the time and pretend he‚Äôs smarter than me, like the sexist man he is. He also had very expensive tastes and low income.

This will not get better, you have to leave and take your trust fund with you. You will need it for child care and you cannot count on him to provide anything."
1808,"Lawyer up and leave. 

Your spouse has a track record of selfish behavior and reckless spending which is unlikely to change. You are worth more than that, you deserve to be treated with respect. 

Act now to protect your assets, your kids and your custody rights. 

Also please stay safe. By leaving and taking your inheritance with you, you will scupper his 'stay at home mom / new car' plan and he may react badly to that."
1809,"I was going to quote which parts of your post showed selfish behaviour from your wife, but it's literally every single paragraph. Your friend is telling you what they think you need to hear, not just what you want to hear, and I think they're right to do so."
1810,He wants to breastfeed your baby. Ughh.
1811,"You are a good person who has had enough. Lots of women are in marriages with partners like this. You are doing all the work. If your partner were gone, you would have one less person to clean up after. Protect your children and your assets. I‚Äôm grateful you have siblings and friends that support you. 

I‚Äôm sorry life is working out this way. It will get better"
1812,"Others have given a lot of great advice here. I just wanted to say that you come across as a very kind, responsible and intelligent person. A really great lady. I'm sorry you have to go through this but I feel like you and your children will get through this difficult time together and thrive. I wish you the best."
1813,There‚Äôs a thread on mumsnet called the trans widow escape committee.  Check it out. I think hearing from other women with similar experiences would help you. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Definitely don‚Äôt get stuck spending all your money on someone who will never prioritise your needs or your children‚Äôs needs over a pretty bra.
1814,"It's interesting that he 'came out' when your daughter was born. And by interesting I mean there's no way it was a coincidence. This is pretty typical of heterosexual, married trans-identified men. This man is unhinged and needs therapy. He also needs to be left to fend for himself.

Take your kids and get out now. See a lawyer about making sure he can't touch that trust fund. Get your car, go to college, look after yourself and your children. He abandoned you all already for his weird fetish. Return the favour. Build the life you want and deserve. 

You are not a shitty person at all. I wish you peace and flourishing, sister. Good luck to you."
1815,[deleted]
1816,"Leave. You are *not* a bad person for leaving. Your relationship is abusive. You're being treated like a surrogate womb and a maid.

As I was reading, all I was thinking was ""would you accept this behaviour if he was still your husband?"". Would *anybody* expect you to tolerate a man behaving like this towards you? Would you doubt yourself even a little if a man put your family in debt for vain desires, wanted to take your maternity leave, demanded to be the one who got the education and the new car, refused to do any kind of chores?

If you stay, you will disappear. You will stop being a person. You will be this man's wallet, womb and comforter. Your entire life will center around what he thinks he wants. And if you wake up from that, you will never forgive yourself. Leave now while you can. Nothing is stopping you. Leave.

(And remember to save a list of the things that made you leave, so that you can read it if you ever doubt that you did the right thing.)"
1817,"The fact that you are so afraid of slipping up and calling him ""he"" is so indicative of the abuse and gaslighting you've endured from this man. Please leave, your children need you."
1818,"My main concern is your money issues. You need to be out ASAP in order for her not to be able to claim your inheritance as community property. 

I would discuss this quickly with a divorce lawyer and figure out how to protect your assets. Those assets are going to be needed to support yourself and your children and not the uncontrolled spending of your partner. 

In most states, just leaving the marital home is the start of an unofficial separation and any moneys made after that aren‚Äôt considered community property. But leaving the home could also be considered abandonment depending on the state and if you own your current house it could also be construed as you giving up claims to it. Again...all that depends on your state. 

I would work as fast and quickly as possible to serve her with paperwork in order to get the ball rolling. And clearly they have zero concern for your well being, your mental health, fiscal health or your children.  This is beyond unacceptable and absolutely selfish on their part. 

You deserve a partner who is actually your partner. There is nothing here that shows they are anything else but completely selfish at this point. 

I know it‚Äôs hard. You tried. This is NOT where you wanted to end up. But you deserve better. Your kids deserve better. Please protect yourself, your assets and your kids and exit swiftly."
1819,"Sounds like your partner just thinks of you as a womb factory, like a surrogate for them."

1823,"Ok I know you already got a lot of comments but I guess mine is a bit different I can give you my point of view as a daughter, My dad was not trans but yet he was very similar to your wife, he was narcissistic in every sense and I can tell you that you are not lost friend at least you are aware of how much extra work you are doing, my mother never realized till it was to late , long~short story 
1 my dad behaved the same way, he usted to buy for him the best clothes, the best shoes etc while my mother would never buy anything for herself even nowadays she struggles to get nice things for herself she would always prefer to buy things for me and my sister 
2. My dad always said she worked more than my mom but is not true , he had a full time job and my mom a middle time but she was the one who did  all the housework and also took care my sis and me (we were very difficult children because we usted to be sick all the time ) he would never ever took us to a Dr appointment, or pay for any kind of treatment 
3. He would always say he paid all the bills but it was not true he used to made the as my mom but still he wanted her to paid for everything ( and you know what he did all the money he got he was burning it all with his mistresses) when my sis or I asked him something for school o whatever he would yell at us and be very aggressive no matter if we were teens of toddlers 
4. He would be very mean to my mother also with my sister and I but with his friends he would always be super kind and supportive so if my mother complained about him nobody would believe her 
Those are just some examples but what I want you to see is that you don‚Äôt have to be afraid  to leave her I want you to take all the anger and desperation you feel to set you free from this situation because it only gets more horrible as time passes I want you to take the best decision FOR YOU, because this person is going to suck the life away from you and when she gets done she won‚Äôt think twice to leave you after all the sacrifices you‚Äôd done, this people don‚Äôt change regardless of their gender, you will never archive your dreams if you stay with her , she doesn‚Äôt care about her family 
I know you are going to say I have a ton a daddy issues or whatever but at the most important thing I want to realize is that you are just in time to change your story and your children‚Äôs (we do notice with the time that thing are not ok, one way or another) 
Please stay strong 
Sorry if I had any gramatical mistakes english is not my mother tongue"
1824,"A bunch of people already raised some points that I was going to mention, so I will not repeat what they said.

1826,"Get. Out. NOW. You'll be better off. I should have left my son's baby daddy before I even gave birth. I'd have had a much easier life. This crazy bullshit sounds a thousand times more bullshitty. 

He guilted you because he thought he should be able breastfeed your children?? Who the fuck does he think he is? But he wants to make sure he has pretty dresses and nails while you go back to full-time work?? This is abusive. And he's wearing a woman costume. He doesn't really want the woman life. 

So sick of these fuckers trying to define womanhood for actual female people."
1827,"> I realize now though, that my wife is not going to *stop* racking up credit card debt for these things she thinks she needs. I go without, because I don't feel as though anything I want like a new bra is that needed for the family to incur more debt or to pay off that less debt that month. 

&#x200B;

JFC, woman, buy yourself a bra. 

You go without and see to it that the laundry is done, the yard is mowed, and dinner is cooked because that is what women do. We do stuff because it needs to be done, not for any other reason.

Time and again, I see stories of men who transition, spend countless dollars to look the part, but never play the part of an actual woman.

Did he seriously think he could breastfeed the baby? WTF?"
1828,"Ugh ‚Äî so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Whoever came up with the idea of marriage must have been a real sadist.

I would talk to a lawyer and try to understand the financial situation better ‚Äî the specifics will depend on what state you‚Äôre in.  Usually an inheritance is considered separate property, and you should make sure you keep it separate and anything you buy with it from all the other marital assets.  You probably should NOT pay off debt that your husband incurred with that money.  Ask the lawyer how his debt is treated, etc.  you may or may not be liable for it.

Also, if you decide to stay together for some reason, I think you can usually sign a postnup so that any future income and debt is kept separate."

Get the best legal advice and leave would be my advice. The situation from what I can see will only get worse, the people around your wife will only enable her further. I wish you luck and I hope it goes as well as these things can. You are not throwing away your marriage and you are not a shitty person. You've done more and put up with more than 99% of us would."
1832,It is COMPLETELY reasonable to feel the way that you are feeling about your marriage. You are not selfish or bigoted or uncaring for wanting out as this point. I see it as an act of self preservation. Be confidant knowing that your husbands behaviour is truly awful and you don‚Äôt deserve to be subjected to that.

1838,"You are being used in every possible way here. Financially, emotionally, and domestically. This does not sound like a loving partnership but a one sided affair.

1839,Has it ever occurred to you that your husband is just hanging around waiting for your inheritance? He treats you and the kids horribly and has no consideration for you as a person.

1840,"Great, and unanimous advice on this thread. Like [DextersXXarmy](https://www.reddit.com/user/DextersXXarmy), I created an account to respond to this thread.

Even if the trans component was not a factor, it would still be regarded as an abusive relationship, both mental and financial abuse. It won't improve, and will only get worse until you trust has been exhausted, then he will leave you. As one or two have said, I would also get the advice from a women's DV centre, because when this person gets wind that the money he planned to use for yet more frilly bras is about to be taken away, things could go badly really quickly. As Dexter and a few others recommended, do your planning on the quiet, and I would add, delete this thread soon.

We know he is manipulating you ‚Äî he apparently can no longer do chores like mow the lawn, because it 'triggers his gender dysphoria' ‚Äî yet has no qualms in using a penis to impregnate you (something he also did 'as a man'). Rather *selective dysphoria*. You are being played. Get out while you can, and before any more financial and emotional damage is done.

Good luck with your exit. Please take care, I cannot stress that enough."

But the fact that it is YOUR families money and now she wants to change the plan and put herself first is sick. Also 3 weeks before returning to work after a baby sounds like torture, Im from Canada where one year is customary. What a complicated situation but you seem so so kind and understanding (I wouldnt be able to accept a partner transitioning) but you do not need to stay out of obligation when your circumstances have changed.

I agree that you don‚Äôt have a relationship anymore, you‚Äôre basically his slave at this point. I can imagine that as it was happening you received assurances that things would improve when he finishes transitioning. I think it‚Äôs reasonable to give up on that, if his plans for your collective future is for you to work your ass off to put him through school and for you to pretend that he‚Äôs the mother of one of your children. Honestly, it sounds like he‚Äôs probably planning to ditch you after school anyway. And what do you need him for? He sounds like an incredible burden."

1855,"Not the first time I have seen this combination of a low-maintenance, not-girly, not-fancy wife whose husband becomes a high-maintenance transwoman. It's almost as if the man is trying to become the image of the woman he wishes his wife would be.   


And it never ends well. Good luck getting out of this marriage ASAP."
1856,"You are married to a Narcissist male parasite. GET THE FUCK OUT. He will spend all your money and ruin your life.

GET OUTTTTTTT."
1857,Please leave him before he can get a hold on your money. He's taken enough from you already. Think of the future you want for your children. Don't let it all go away because he wants more lacy bras.
1858,"I'm sorry that you're not getting the support you need from those around you.

The best decisions about the future can only be made based on what you know in the present. You know that money is being taken away from you and your kids. Now your inheritance is coming in and your spouse already has that money earmarked for a new car and education for him. Given the current situation you'll be slaving away with a third child in ratty second hand clothes while you're spouse lives like a king and enjoys the fruits of what your family intended for you.

Your spouse does nothing around the house, no inside or outside chores. He goes to work, comes home and while you're slaving away he shares his stories and problems but never offers to help. Your partner can't take care of the kids. There is no partnership. They're doing nothing to support you and to hold up their end. Instead it's just taking and taking.

Please just imagine if a friend had come to you with this. How would you counsel her? 

You have a luxury that few women have and that is the ability to get themselves set up for the future so they are self sufficient. Look after yourself and your kids. Please don't let it be stolen from you."
1859,Dump that fucking gold digger.
1860,"You're not a shitty person. Look, what your husband has done is chosen to put his needs above not just yours, but your children's.  That's it right there, full stop. If his new transition is so important to him, let him go.  I guarantee you this is only going to get worse, and you know what? It's not about you. It's not about him. It's about your kids. They don't deserve to live with this drama, debt, and strife above their heads.

&#x200B;

Do not, I repeat, DO NOT give him a cent of your inheritance money. That's going to be your ticket away from this bullshit. It's good that your brother wants to help, but that money may help you jumpstart a new life for yourself. If he wants to go back to school, let him work for it on his own. You do not exist to serve him and his selfish desires. You are your own person."
1861,"I‚Äôm new to this sub - how does a mtf breastfeed??

Also get a lawyer onto your trust fund ASAP. I‚Äôm hoping you can keep this aside from your mutual assets."
1862,"This person reacts in such ways that you're afraid to accidentally ""misgender"" them online 

If you're gonna divorce do it before the trust fund matures and let them pay at least their share of the debt"
1863,"I don't have time to read through everything but if he has not had surgeries yet, I can guarantee you that he is going to want to use your money for boobs, facial feminization surgery, bottom surgery, Adam's apple surgery, hair plugs, permanent hair removal. Do not let this narcissist have access to your money!!! 
This is not how women act. Women put their family above their own needs. He is a man. 
I divorced a male to female person and I am in groups with others who have as well. You are so not alone. You are so married to a narcissist.

And he seems to have some autogynephilia going on but who knows. I suggest getting a great lawyer and a great therapist for you and for your kids. He has been gaslighting you for a long time and you need to heal. 
Good luck to you."
1864,"Chiming in‚Äîremove him from all checking accounts, credit cards, anything financial that you share. Get a lawyer, and a financial adviser so that you can make sure your assets and those of your children are protected. 

Find a a way to put your inheritance into a trust  he doesn‚Äôt know about and cannot access‚Äîeven in a community property state, you can do this.

Get a burner phone so he can‚Äôt access any of your calls.

Use a VPN and make new email accounts that he cannot trace or access.

Get an IUD. 

He sees you as an ATM and a 401K.

 Do not think for one second that you owe him anything."
1865,"I just want to say I'm in your shoes. I've been married for a long time. We have  kids, and I'm pregnant. 
My spouse came out trans May 2018. I don't call him ""her, she"" or by the new name they paid for. I was very supportive in the beginning, but as time went on I couldn't. 
The hormones make them so emotional.
I've heard all the ""I'm sad I can't get pregnant"" ""I wish I could breastfeed""
He also doesn't help with the house or kids. He even told me the kids feel like adopted kids because he didn't give birth to them, so it's hard to bond with them.
Please don't give him your money. You really have to take care of yourself. Go to school, get a better job, and take care of your children. 
I'm going back to school, and it's the best decision I've made in the last 15 years. 
I don't think being in a relationship with someone like that ever gets better. One day you'll regret how much of your life you've given up."
1866,Sounds like she wants to be a woman with the perks of being a men.
1867,"The trans stuff really doesn‚Äôt matter here (aside from wanting to claim your maternity leave which inspires several snarky, but non-constructive comments to spring to mind)

The financial irresponsibility is enough to warrant divorce.  Please get a lawyer ASAP.  You need to protect what assets you have.  

I would not be surprised if your spouse reacts very poorly to your ending the marriage.  The level of self-absorption is high.  Keep this quiet, get your legal ducks in order, make sure you gave copies of critical documents, and wait to announce until you are ready."
1868,Your plan is the right path. Get divorced before this trust is turned over to you. I assume there's a trustee so if the divorce takes more than six months maybe they can delay the disbursement. You're a good mother who works hard for her kids and sacrifices your desires for them; don't let a spouse who would rather bury you in debt and use you as a maid make your life any harder.
1869,Run.
1870,Get out before you get the trust fund.  Every penny of it will be spent on lacy bras and leg waxes by your narcissistic spouse.
1871,"I honestly believe its time for a divorce. And normally im an advocate for working things out in a marriage. But you married a *man*, not a delusional child. And im not even being mean, thats what he is."
1872,"This is the first time I've commented. Please, please, PLEASE, whatever you do - protect that money. This is someone who has already sucked you dry. Get out of the marriage BEFORE you inherit that money, so it doesn't get split if/when you later split.

This man has shown you who he is. He wants your money. He will put his own needs before you and HIS CHILDREN. It also sounds like his behaviour is escalating.

PROTECT THAT MONEY. Get out. Get out now.

Get legal advice so you don't get saddled with his credit card debts."
1873,"When and if you get to the point of divorce, be prepared for him to threaten suicide. It's just another control tactic, and your best response is to immediately call the police. It will help you retain custody of your children as well."
1874,"He doesn't value you and uses you (for money and chores). I'm sorry but this sounds just like a man being a man and I don't think there will be a lot of positive change, like at all :/

Also, you should really read Lundy Bancrofts book (you can find it for free on the internet)"
1875,"I haven‚Äôt logged into this account in over a year, I usually lurk here. I logged in just to message you some support. I think you should leave, and do it as quickly as possible. Feel free to PM me when you need someone to talk. I‚Äôm a mom too and I know how hard it can be."
1876,"The behavior you have described is emotionally abusive, and his obsession with perfoming what he perceives as feminine acts sounds like a possible case of autogynephilia:

https://medium.com/@sue.donym1984/the-elephant-in-the-room-dc822144a81b

You have no idea how much we as a group empathize with what you (and other women in similar situations) are going through."
1877,"What a coincidence that they decided they ""feel like a female"" after the second child. This shit is what scares me about having kids. It seems to happen to so many women I know. Have 2, 3 or 4 kids and then the mask comes off. I don't blame women for only having 1 kid or having 2 kids far apart in age, these days."
1878,You definitely need to get divorced. Please get divorced.
1879,"In his head he has already spent your money on himself

 LEAVE tout suite"
1880,"I‚Äôm so sorry that you are going through this. Have you read about autogynephelia ? If not, you need to. Your husband sounds like a textbook example.  Autogynephilia, or transvestic fetishism, is a sexual paraphillia. And sexual paraphillias tend to cluster.  For example , Many autogynephiles are also exhibitionists, masochists, ‚Äúadult babies‚Äù. Pediphiles, Etc. I would get on his computer and search his porn use  to see what you are dealing with at once, and find out how to document it legally in case you need it for custody / divorce.  If you find something really unsettling, you may need to call a lawyer or even the police. Be ready for that possibility when you do this. There is also an overlap of autogynephelia with personality disorders and narcissism. And when they take hormones, they can become very unstable. This is all very damaging to you and the kids. I would suggest that you get out of the marriage at once.  Stay with relatives or something until you can get your money and a new job home and school for your kids , a divorce and pay off debt. 

One other thing I need to say is that your baby should NOT be breastfed by a transitioning male via chemically induced lactation.  This has been done once at Mt Sinai using dangerous drugs.  there are no studies to prove that this is safe for the baby, and even if there were , I wouldn‚Äôt trust them. Common sense says NO to this.  It‚Äôs likely part of his particular fetish , as could be pregnancy and periods. Jamie Shoupe  is a former transwomen who had autogynephelia and is very open about his experience. If you want to help your husband you need to be honest with him that he isn‚Äôt a women but he has a fetish which has spiraled out of control and it‚Äôs destroying your family.  If he is reasonable he will recognize this and seek help. Therapy cbt and Drugs can be taken to reduce compulsion and depression that come with cross dressing. This is the better way to deal with things as opposed to enabling his delusion.  

There is a community of trans widows.  I  met one recently and I‚Äôve seen many posts from them on twitter and reddit. 

Again I‚Äôm really sorry that you are going though this.

Also , You need to prioritize your own health and safety and that of the kids and stop being a doormat for your abusive husband.  If you choose to stay, rules need to be set for equal distribution of work , childcare, spending  and chores. Debt needs to be paid off at once and no more shopping/ hair/nail for hubby until you‚Äôre in a position to afford that sort of expense. You‚Äôll probably need a lot of money for CBT therapy and medications for your husband. Is that how you want to spend your inheritance ? 

And absolutely NO male babysitters, period.  That includes transwomen. Sorry, there are just way too many stories of sexual abuse to take that risk. 

Good luck to you."
1881,Honestly I don't see this as a trans issue so much as it being about your husband not being the person you married anymore. Which happens sometimes. People change. It sucks. But I think you need to get a divorce and move on. For yourself and your kids. Oh and your husband is a man. A woman can't get another woman pregnant.
1882,"Reguardless of the gender here, reguardless of the sex, religion, color, nationality. I would tell you the same thing.. your feelings are absolutely valid and the best thing for your child is to get out now. You deserve the chance to go back to college, you deserve the support someone who bore a child needs, and you may be friends... but for your kids sake you need to get out. Kids shouldn‚Äôt grow up seeing a dynamic like that, kids shouldn‚Äôt grow up learning that ‚Äúbeing trans‚Äù will get you out of sticky situations... I would post it to relationship advice, but don‚Äôt mention anything about trans, ask it as if it was a guy ‚Äúspraying cologne‚Äù and ‚Äúbuying a bunch of nice suits‚Äù I‚Äôd be interested to see what they think"
1883,"I'm so sorry, what a nightmare. You're right, you need to leave this person ASAP. Not just for your sake, but for your kids' too. I know it's scary, but it doesn't even sound like he'll be a big loss once you've broken free. Good luck to you! Stay strong!"
1884,"I hope you take your kids and take YOUR trust fund and run. Regardless of gender that behavior is self centered and immature. The worst being that as a parent they needed help caring for their own kids for a hot minute (how do they think you do it all the time?) and the maternity leave thing...fuck no! Like really they think that you should have a baby and go back to work so they can take your money and stay home with a baby when it‚Äôs your body that‚Äôs healing, when it‚Äôs your body that‚Äôs equipped to feed that baby? RUN RUN RUN don‚Äôt feel bad don‚Äôt look back I hope they don‚Äôt get any kind of alimony from you in the divorce they don‚Äôt deserve it. Leave her with her credit card debt and temper tantrums and run!"
1885,"I would say get out before you get your inheritance money. Your partner sounds lazy, selfish, and emotionally immature, and I think your partner might try to keep the money to himself if he gets a hold of it. This could lead to financial abuse, and him controlling you with the money. Get out now and make sure you keep the money away from him."
1886,"Wow, if it makes you feel better. You'll probably be canonised when you die. 

Nobody in the world would possible judge you for getting out, you're still young and from when you've written seem to be doing the lions share of everything without any support. I mean, the fact that your partner wants you to pop out another baby so they can enact out their maternity leave fantasy while you slog onwards. What an SOB. 

I don't know you, but you deserve better and your partner needs a wake up call if that's even possible at this stage. Which I doubt."
1887,"Your partner is abusive. There are many types of abuse, and he fits several (financial, emotional, etc.) Your partner does not care about you or your kids if he‚Äôs putting his own aesthetic desires above his family‚Äôs needs. It‚Äôs great that your brother is willing to help; take advantage of it. You are making the right decision, and you‚Äôve got lots of people here who support you. Stay strong. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1888,"I'm sure you've discovered in looking online that ALL of the available advice is about how you need to help your husband become the woman he thinks he's always been.  No sign of the fact that living with a full-blown narcissist is damaging to you and your kids and that YOU ARE BEING ABUSED.  Don't believe the hype.  You need to take care of yourself and your kids and stop catering to this abuser.  Leave.  Take your kids.  Contact a domestic abuse hotline.  they might be able to connect you with a shelter in the state you desire to live in.  Lie like a rug.  Don't give him a single clue about what you're planning.  There's no reason to think that he won't continue manipulating you the way he has been.  And, if he thinks he can't get his way, there's also no reason to think he won't use physical means to keep you in place.  

Right now, all you can think about is your kids.  Let that motivate you.  So many of these guys are paedophiles and abusers.  Not all, but a lot.  I hope when you get yourself detangled from this mess, you will take the time to take care of yourself as well.  Many spouses have ended up with basically PTSD after enduring the craziness of these situations.

Take care and good luck!"
1889,"No, you're are absolutely not a bad person. Imagine if a friend of yours told you a story like this about her husband. No, your husband's behavior is abusive. 

People might give you crap because your husband identifies as trans, but remember that you don't owe anyone an explanation. If people bug you about it just tell them it's personal and you don't want to talk about it."
1890,"I'd get out. It sounds like he fetishises the parts of femininity he likes like dressing cute and breast feeding babies. That's actually a pattern with men who claim to be women. Get out. He'll only demand more emotional labor from you, more financial support from you, and if you fail to comply you'll be an evil transphobe. Save your sanity and your kids. Get out."
1891,Really glad you're getting out of this mess. I really hope it goes by with as few hitches as possible and that he doesn't try to fight for custody. You deserve that trust fund money for yourself and your children. I can't imagine being betrayed like this by someone you love so much. But you're doing the right thing. Don't let him or his crappy friends or even your sister convince you otherwise.
1892,"This genuinely scares me for you OP. Please, PLEASE don't let them take the money and I'd really avoid another pregnancy like it were the plague b/c it just seems like a good way of trapping you into the relationship even more. I am angry reading this. It sickens me and grosses me the FUCK out! This is NOT an equal partnership. it is NOT okay how you are being treated! PLEASE OP, be safe, get out of there if you can holy shit!"

1894,"I joined reddit just so I could post this comment.   All this talk about the future, talking to a lawyer, etc. is part 2 of what you need to know.  Having dealt with narcissistic partners myself, I encourage you to leave now.  I think you may be in physical danger right now.  Even if violence was never part of the relationship before, do you think that's not Plan B when Mr. Asshole realizes he's losing out on the free play money?  He'll throw you against the wall and stomp on your neck before you even talk to that lawyer.  Get out of the house now.  Pack a suitcase with valuables and the papers you need, take the kids and go to your brother, a shelter, a hotel, anywhere.  What do you think his mental process is right now?  People like him are psychic where their interests are concerned.   HE KNOWS you aren't happy and are getting uppity.  Run right now.  It won't hurt your case, it will help it actually.   Signed, ex gf of a formerly sweet sensitive guy who pulled a gun on me when I wanted to leave the relationship.  I got out of there by apologizing profusely for not understanding him.  It was in the middle of the night, I spent the night in my car.  Before that, there was never a hint of violence.  Do you get it, that's always Plan B for this type of guy.  Also, if he kills you, he will get away with it, because, don't you know, it was a sex game gone wrong."
1895,"Log into myplanapp.org 

It is an app to help women organise their escape from DV prisons. It comes highly recommended from others and a good friend found it effective to support her escape from another narcissistic man-child. 

Remember that he may try to access your online comms so as DextersXXarmy said, delete this thread. Set up an account to store evidence and that is its sole purpose.  Only access it via a VPN or a device he has no access to. If you have an internet contract in both your names, get one with only yours.

Oh copy what you said and any useful responses from this thread into that account a G-drive account will have cloud storage and put it in a document. It is evidence. Aldi take a few screen shots of your OP as further evidence. 

Then delete this thread."
1896,"Leave him. He is abusive and mentally ill, he will only get worse. Save yourself and your children. AND BE SELFISH ABOUT YOUR MONEY."
1897,"GET OUT. Your spouse is a selfish person who is bleeding you dry. Gender identity has nothing to do with this fact. You're not a bad person for leaving someone who makes you work this hard. Men may identify as women but they don't change. I was just reading about how men are far more likely to leave a wife for getting sick than the other way around. Women are far more loyal. The way your spouse is acting you can probably expect he would keep acting like a  man as he is doing now, expecting you do to do all the home labor, and if you get sick will be on his way. It's important that you don't let this notion that he isn't a man somehow make you believe he's different than other men. ALL MEN tell you they are not like other men and they can be trusted when they are working to best take advantage of you. Run. Take your money and go. And spend it on YOURSELF. You will find someone who treasures you and does his share if you treasure yourself and stop over taxing yourself to keep someone so hard to please happy."
1898,"I'm so sorry you are going through all of this. Divorce does indeed sound like the best option! You are putting your family first and also doing all the household chores while she seems to not care. Does she even realize how much all of this wears you down?

I wish you all the best going forward. You deserve an equal partner who does their fair share of chores and who isn't high maintenance when you can't afford it."
1899,Get out of there. You are describing a fucking nightmare and I need to believe you will set yourself free from the prison that's been built around you and your kids. Your wife is a narcissist and can't be trusted to care for you or your kids. Take your money and run.
1900,"This sounds so awful. If I were you I'd also be filing for divorce asap.

Your spouse is being entirely selfish and disregarding YOUR needs and the needs of the family. 

Unfortunately I don't have any advice regarding divorce procedures- but lawyering up at this point seems like a good idea. 

I wish you and your little one the best of luck. Remember that you deserve so much more than what you are having to deal with now."
1901,oh my fucking god divorce him that‚Äôs horrendous. i couldn‚Äôt hold in my gagging when i heard he refuses to do ‚Äúmen‚Äôs work‚Äù and makes you do Everything to make up for it. i swear to god you should have dropped his ass then and there. you have far stronger willpower than i do. i hope you and your kids get out of that awful arrangement asap.
1902,"What an awful situation OP! So sorry you have to go thtough all that. Regardless of the gender/sex of your partner, this simply doesnt sound like a partnership and you are right to want to leave. You might want to look into trans widow resources on the web, as many of the things you write about appear to be common among many women who were married to trans women. Best of luck!!!"
1903,"This is such typical male behavior. You do everything and he still manages to act like this... no appreciation for you and his idea of womanhood seems hypersexualized and over-the-top so I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs what we call an autogynephile, a man who takes erotic pleasure in seeing himself as a woman. It‚Äôs not his dysphoria that‚Äôs keeping him from chores, it‚Äôs his male entitlement to female labor, he‚Äôs manipulating you. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he wanted to breast feed for sexual reasons. I bet his porn history would reveal a lot of misogynist crap. I mean, it‚Äôs already obvious he‚Äôs a misogynist."
1904,"Your husband sounds selfish and isn't extending any compassion towards you like you've done for him. You'll be so much better without him, and your children will be safer away from a man who puts the validation of his fantasy gender as a higher priority than them. <3"
1905,"Please leave him. Based on what you‚Äôve said, it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs not treating you properly and won‚Äôt ever in the future. He might cry and make a fuss, but you‚Äôre better off without him. For the sake of you and your kids, please look into leaving him."
1906,"Use that money you're getting to get a divorce. He is using you and this will never end. She will suck up all your money even if you get a higher paying job. I'm sorry you already have children together. At least you are still young.

Get that friend of yours to help with the divorce process."
1907,"Everyone has offered very good advice and we all agree you'd be much better on your own, with your own money, having a future for your kids with it. Going on only will only bring you more trouble.
I don't think that we are biased in your favour. It's just that here we think women are not slaves and deserve their own happiness, exactly as everyone else.
Your situation, but with reversed sexes (careless mother), would be considered awful and his mother would be advising him to divorce you. No one would be this understanding with a flawed female. Society demands very much from us but forgives men and find excuses for them.
I'm very sorry for what you're experiencing.
I just wanted to add that I find very odd his way of dealing with dysphoria: working out at the gym doesn't increase his muscles? And more importantly, fathering a third child (impregnating his wife with his penis) doesn't trigger his dysphoria?
This guy is not transitioning. He's only putting make up on his face. And everyone in his family is siding with him regardless of his wrongdoings, which is very dangerous for you. Don't buy their emotional blackmail. You're right to be concerned and you have the right to live a peaceful live. That you choose not to jump into a deep well is not selfish. It's the sensible thing to do, for you and your kids."
1908,"Oh love, you need to get out. Please accept any help possible from your brother, and don‚Äôt let your husband touch the trust fund. Keep us all updated!"
1909,"LISTEN TO YOUR GUT. You do NOT need to continue supporting this man. He is a narcissist. Take your inheritance and use it to get away from him for good. I'm so sorry you have to go through this right now, but the sooner you cut him off, the sooner you and your family will start to heal."
1910,"It doesn't matter how much effort HE puts in his parody of womanhood, he still a male ... A machist male."
1911,""" I'm going to refer to my wife as ""her"", because I don't want to  accidentally call her 'him' offline -that's not pleasant for anyone the  occasional time I slip up."" *Red flag!*

&#x200B;

""Last month she got mad at me for washing one of her lacy bras with my  sports bras, upset enough to the point of crying and all I could do was  stand there staring at this grown woman sobbing because a bit of lace  came off her bra"" *This is a form of emotional abuse.*

&#x200B;

"" I have three bras and they're ratty sports bras..."", "" My wife is high maintenance. She gets to  go to a nice salon for her hair care and waxing needs, she owns a dozen  nice bras, she has a complicated skin routine, she gets to tan and get  new clothes and owns way more shoes then I do.

We cannot afford this. 95% of our credit card debt is from her high maintenance needs."" *What you're describing here is financial abuse. It isn't okay that you're barely getting the necessities you need, but your spouse spends like crazy.*

&#x200B;

""She's literally never been alone with our children for any significant  amount of time. I left her and the kids for four days last year for a  friend's out of state wedding (that friend paid for, and we didn't feel  comfortable asking her to pay for the whole family), and she couldn't  handle that."" *You're spouse is a narcissist, and so the kids are only good when they're fun.*

""I'm so sick of it all. She won't have a real conversation, instead she  just bursts into tears, has excuses or just gets mad and tells me she  needs some alone time if I try to talk to her about anything. "" *More narcissism.*

&#x200B;

""A relative of mine left a trust fund to be given to me when I turn 30.  That's in six months. The plan was to pay off all our debt, get me a new  car because my current one is on its last legs, and for me to go back  to school, then after I was done with school she would go back. And  then, we'd take the remainder of the trust fund and move to a cheaper  city to live where we would buy a house. "" *Narcissists are selfish.*

&#x200B;

"" Wife told me last week that she wants to be the one to go back to school  first, and that she can do the stay at home mom thing while she's doing  it and of course, that means she gets the new car while I'll get her  current car. She also said that it'd be a good time for us to have our  last baby, since she could stay home with him/her while in school after I  went back to work and it'd ""practically be maternity leave"" *Narcissists are delusional.*

&#x200B;

"" So instead of having an honest conversation about who should go to  school and how we'd handle the trust fund money, she made it about her,  and how *she* felt watching me while I  was pregnant and her agony of not being able to breastfeed her baby or  of knowing she could never be pregnant ..."" *That's a narcissist for ya.*"
1912,"Oh, my.  I'm so sorry you are going through all of this.

It appears that you are emotionally and financially invested in your family to the point of **denying yourself** needed things.

Unfortunately, your wife is emotionally and financially invested only in herself to the point of **denying her family** needed things.

Trans or not, you would be a fool to let this person get one dollar from your trust fund.  I know that's harsh, but your spouse is now a member of the ""cult of trans"" and it will affect you in ways too numerous to list here.  

And until you get a legal separation, you will be responsible for any bills she accrues.

Take care."
1913,"I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, your spouse sounds like a typical narcissist who is stealing your life and your energy. It's unfair to you, and you don't deserve so little self-care and so much of the domestic and emotional labor ‚Äì as well as this big debt burden! We've seen over and over that a trans spouse will drain away all the financial resources for their transition ‚Äì and then just keep taking. Any reasonable person would feel badly about doing this to you. Leave and don't let your spouse get any of your trust money if you can work that out. Learn about financial management, go to debtor's anonymous if you have to (it's actually very supportive and not as dogmatic as other 12-steps), but get out of the debt lifestyle for your own sanity. Put your windfall money into savings ‚Äì as much as you can. You'll find if you're not leaking money you can do a lot more with it and take care of yourself and your children and make all your own dreams come true. You need financial freedom. I would also recommend addressing your codependence in this relationship. This is not a judgement, I have similar issues and working on myself to find my own peace was the right thing because I can't control others. (Edit for child to children.)"
1914,"Run. Good grief, I'm so sorry you're in this situation, but for the sake of your children and your own sanity, you have to.  This isn't a trans issue, this is an issue with your spouse being selfish and abusive and taking advantage.  Spouse absolutely ignoring your needs and those of your children while driving your family into debt and refusing to shoulder their share of the burden? Not OK no matter who they are.

The trans issue is just the crazy icing on a crappy cake - this person seems to be using it as the excuse for their appalling behaviour.

Very glad you've got a supportive brother.  Stick with him, get that lawyer and don't talk to sister about it.  Hate to say it, but if she knows what you are doing, she may sabotage and tell your spouse if she's trying to get you to stay together."
1915,"Please keep us up to date. I‚Äôm so sorry. Also, as others have said, do not underestimate what he will do once you try to get away. Support networks, a good lawyer, and money (and depriving him of access to money he might abuse) are essential. If there‚Äôs any hint of physical coercion or violence, begin talking to a DV shelter to plan an exit"
1916,I'm so sorry your in this situation. Take the money and the kids and leave. You deserve so much better than this narcissistic man.
1917,"Can't tell you what to do but if it were me, I'd kick him out. Leave him. 

He is selfish. He does not respect you. 

This is not an equal relationship. He will likely never change. He does not know how to love you. 

Look up Richard Grannon on youtube, he explains narcissism, it's what your husband is.

If you leave him, don't take him back.

I hope you get to see this, there are so many comments!

Good luck x"
1918,"I would start divorce proceedings long before that money goes anywhere near your bank account. I'm not sure if you're in the US but he might be legally entitled to half of the sum because 'husband'. I wouldn't drag my feet on this either, he's a textbook narcissist that doesn't have you or your children's best interest at heart. He's going to fleece you out of your own money and disappear into the sunset. Men have been doing the same since time immemorial. He's been showing you all this time what kind of person he is.  


Believe him."

1921,"You need to divorce him BEFORE you get your inheritance! He‚Äôs squandered his relationship with you, squandered money you don‚Äôt have with credit cards, hes potentially endangered your children, and he‚Äôll squander your trust fund as well. Which means not only has he ruined your nuclear family, he‚Äôll ruin your future and your kids‚Äô futures as well. I‚Äôm sorry for being blunt but you‚Äôre right, love is not enough and it‚Äôs time to extricate yourself and your children before more terrible damage is done. 

I need to add this: if you‚Äôre feeling guilty about leaving him because of transitioning, remind yourself that you‚Äôre not leaving him for being trans, you‚Äôre leaving him for being a sociopath."

1924,"You seem like a genuine kind hearted person. Your spouse sounds very selfish and not grounded in reality. She has/had a loving wife that took care of her and respected her when most would‚Äôve left in your situation, yet she cannot look passed herself long enough to realize that there is two people in this marriage not just her. I‚Äôm a woman and it isn‚Äôt every aspect of my life. I don‚Äôt disregard others to make myself feel better as a woman. I don‚Äôt whine to other men and treat them different because I have periods and they don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt envy men for something they cannot control, so I‚Äôm not sure why she envies you for simply existing (being able to get pregnant and the sorts). Honestly it‚Äôs bullshit. Idk what it is about this theme that makes it okay for some trans women to completely revert back to children. In this political climate we have today, they are cradled by an entire movement like babies; so much so that they forget that they are adults and that their feelings and needs do not come first in every aspect of life. I‚Äôd expect a child to think/feel/act this way because children are to be dependent and protected by society and the adults around them. But I‚Äôll be damned if I sit here and hold a 30 year olds hand and allow them to act like my children. God bless you and get out while you can. Unless she can look beyond her damn self for 2 seconds out of the 10 years y‚Äôall have been together, I don‚Äôt see this being beneficial or salvageable for you. Trans people like this should just date each other. Can you imagine the narcissistic black hole the two of them would create in a small room? One upping each other‚Äôs tears and triggers. Good God."
1925,"One part of your story that really bothers me is the breastfeeding and maternity leave thing. That is so far from normal in actual lesbian relationships. My girlfriend has talked about how she‚Äôd like to be the one to carry a baby for us someday, and I would never ever think to go through the cost and effort of causing myself to lactate unless she ends up having major difficulty with it herself. Not to mention the whole point of maternity leave is to allow a woman some time to physically and emotionally recover from the act of giving birth. It sounds like your spouse is just obsessed with acting out her idea of womanhood, as if it‚Äôs nothing more than a frilly costume and a performance."
1926,"I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. It sounds so disheartening and so exhausting. I know the most important things are your and your children‚Äôs safety and well-being, and that probably means divorce. But I‚Äôm worried about his getting half your money, so I would actually say there‚Äôs no Hope here and file for divorce BEFORE your birthday. I would think that may protect your trust fund from your spouse getting half of it. They sound so selfish and self-absorbed. Definitely no sex and no unprotected sex and oh, so they‚Äôre on hormones but also still fertile? Hmm. Anyway protect yourself and your family and get away from this narcissist as soon as you can. They will still have visitation or even custody rights but you will not be chained to them and their bad mistakes. Half those credit card bills will probably be your responsibility, if they‚Äôre in both your names. So sorry your spouse has taken this selfish journey."
1927,"You are absolutely right about everything that you've said! But you may not realize that you are in an abusive relationship and it's only going to get worse. And it will get even worse when you get your money. 

You have to keep your money away from your spouse who will spend it on themselves and leave you & the kids destitute. You also need to get out now! If you don't you'll continue to be abused by your spouse! You must leave for the health & safety of you and your children. Your spouse is showing dangerous mental illness! 

You already know it's wrong and you know you need to leave. Counseling may work in the future but right now you have protect yourself and your children!

Have courage and to what you know that should do! Good luck."

1935,"If you do divorce, I'd be very surprised is this dude demands full, or even part, custody. He can't bother to do any chores for himself so cleaning up after two kids would give him a huge kick in the balls. 

Plus it sounds like he can't handle child rearing in general since he pawns that off to you 100% of the time. 

People say ""leave him, divorce him"" and although I agree I do recognize that lighting a bomb on your marriage is going to be emotionally devastating, even if it's the right thing to do in the long run. Usually when people knee jerk into divorce with out a plan they are left vulnerable. 

I suggest coming up with a plan b over the next few months. Talk to a divorce lawyer to come up with a plan. Slowly disconnect yourself emotionally from your spouse. Read this sub. Document their behavior to reinforce why you want to leave. Educate yourself on the financial side of divorce, and staying married to a man who racks up debt. come up with a plan to financially protect yourself as much as possible. Find a confidant who will help you make this transition to being single again because it will be scary and painful at times. Again, read this sub because he and his friends will use the trans thing to leverage power over you, gaslight you, guilt trip you, etc. 

Good luck and post updates for support."

1937,"You do what is best for you and your children. It sounds like you are second best to your partners gender change in my opinion. And that your partner doesn't realise that children and family come first before anything.

I have very little experience with transsexuals, but it's seems to me that when a person is transitioning, then that becomes the be all and end all to their existence. Everything centre's around them and their change, it consumes their mentality and opinion on almost everything.

Get out before you receive the money, as if you stay with this person, they will only be thinking about how they can get their hands on the money to spend on their new lifestyle, thus be taking the money away from your children and yourself."
1938,"God that would make me explode. I can totally understand wanting to divorce that person. 
Just a few tips, as I'm a single parent as well: buying a house is not worth it. My parents used to own one and the expenses like new central heating, .. can really break your neck when you don't have savings. Just renting something makes your income more planned. I've lived in cheap appartment blocks for most of my life and there are really good ones, very central in the city that have playgrounds in the garden and everything. You get used to it. If you can afford it, there are houses to rent as well. I also buy everything, from furniture to clothing thrifted or on flea markets. There are special flea markets for children's stuff, you should really look out for those! They usually have shoes as well. I was glad about that since good shoes are necessary for children and they can be really expensive. A library card is a good idea as well, my daughter just started reading. It is totally possible to raise children on your own, don't worry :) better times will come when you got rid of him"

I am assuming you are a straight female who is now married to a woman. I married a man for love and for life with a man. My husband does the typical male things and I do the typical female things. When I need an oil change he does it. When he comes in from doing that and is hungry I make him something to eat.  Not that we don‚Äôt ever step out of our ‚Äútraditional male/female roles to help each other out and not saying everyone has to be like us but if he wanted to become a woman(sounds mean) but I have no use for a woman around the house or with our kids. I am not attracted to woman and I can‚Äôt even handle woman friends because of the neediness that comes with most woman. Not to mention sexual intimacy I want a man not a woman.  I felt from reading your story that your husband doesn‚Äôt even recognize or care how you feel.  Like this isn‚Äôt about your life at all. You just have to accept all this. To bad that you wanted and married a man. I am going to act like a spoiled teenager and you just have to deal with it. 

You would be doing yourself and your children a great service leaving this toxic, unwanted, unhealthy relationship!  One day find a nice man and have the life you deserve. You only get one life and you matter to!! 

Good luck with what ever you choose!!"
1947,"\[edit\] I just read my post, and I'd just like to say from the start that I'm sorry you're going through this. It sounds really difficult, and I hope you have the support you need. The end of a marriage is rough, no matter the circumstances.

&#x200B;

To me it sounds like your SO is using (abusing) being trans and your love and accommodation for her to act like a spoiled, self-centered brat. This is probably mostly caused by deep, pervasive insecurity on her part, but it sounds like the insecurity is taking over as she tries way too hard to achieve a probably unachievable/unrealistic view of what it means to be ""female."" It sounds like there's some significant maturing that she needs to do, which probably needs a lot more therapy. I would expect there's a lifetime of work on her part, and depending on her own personality, it could even be unachievable. Real, deep change is always a long and difficult process.

More importantly, it's not your responsibility to solve her problems. Her internal emotional/psychological struggles are her own. It sounds like you've been supportive and tried, which IMO, is what a spouse should do. It's not a failing on your part if your SO has things that you can't resolve. Like you, I've always had a deep seated view that marriage is forever, but I had my marriage end due to my SO's mental illness. Like you, I struggled for a while with feeling like a failure for ""giving up."" I was unsure of myself and didn't know if I was making the right decision. It took years to work through it--no matter the circumstances, or how right the decision, ending a marriage is a tragic experience. Even if it's right, it sucks. Looking back a decade later, there was nothing I could do to help my ex. Staying was hurting us both. It was important to me to feel like I really tried and didn't just give up on my marriage, but it was ultimately the right decision to end it. You may not really know if you're making the right decision, but you have to care for yourself. If you really can't do it anymore, then trust yourself--you're doing the right thing."

I know I sound harsh, but I'm at my limit with shitty male behaviour and this story is fucking extra.

Often true even of non-TIM males. In my world, my friends' husbands who are SAHDs actually hand the kids off to their mother or MIL to watch, and then their wives have to schedule pediatrician appointments from work, rush home to cook dinner, and do laundry at midnight before getting up at 5 a.m. for their jobs."
1959,"I probably do say sorry too much, and definitely for sure do it more after my wife transitioned. It was like living with a hormonal 12 year old for a bit there, and it was also really annoying because you can tell a hormonal 12 year old (like my mother told *me* and I fully plan on telling my daughter) that she's allowed to have emotions but not allowed to use those emotions as an excuse to treat those around her like dirt. You try to tell your trans wife that and you're apparently not being understanding of what she's going through. Which made me mad, but I ignored my anger and tried to be empathetic. 

All of what you said about breastfeeding is true and what we found on our research; wife did not like reading it at *all* and it and my ""lack of support for *her*"" (because, you know, I was 100% concerned about the baby's needs as well as the money) was a hot topic in therapy for too long. 

>Can't even be bothered to help you clean up and give you a chance to hang out with your children?

The kids are doing their own age appropriate chores too after dinner; and occasionally she'll give them a hand which actually isn't helpful because I want the kids learning how to do things and that it's part of them being apart of the household so everyone has chores. If I ask, she'll help me dry dishes or something, but I don't think I *should* have to ask you know? 

I looked at the ""mypartneristrans"" subreddit, and honestly it feels like there's a lot of very young people there, and/or those in the same place I was two years ago. I don't think they have any valid advice or would offer much support to me; it feels like it would be about my wife's needs and feelings if I did post there. Her needs and feelings are all I've been hearing about since she told me. God, even when I was in labor I had to hear about how it was making her feel. You ladies are biased in my favor, and I think I need that."
1960,I like you.
1961,"**Replying to the top post again** to say that honestly, I'm seriously considering giving my wife an excuse to go stay in my home state for the two months residency requirement then filing (and talking to a lawyer there.) 

It feels dishonest, and like every evil ex wife stereotype, especially with how my home state treats trans people but given the state we live in I don't think courts here are going to look at the facts and put my kids and whats best for them first over my wife. 

The kids are all I care about. A little bit me, but honestly, 95% is them. Especially my daughter. She's not a doll for my wife to live vicariously though. 

I can't stop thinking about when my daughter is a teenager. What if she doesn't like wearing dresses like I did at that age? Or doesn't want long hair or like getting her nails painted? Will wife make her feel bad for any of that? Like my daughter is less of a girl? And I can't stop picturing my daughter telling me she got her first period, then my wife getting upset daughter didn't tell *her* first, and making our daughter feel a little...not quite guilty because wife won't ever have a period or get pregnant assuming wife lets us talk freely about it instead of hiding it. God, I can't even ask her to pick up some tampons on her way home because it upsets her. 

As I keep think about it, I'm realizing I'd feel awkward with my wife sitting there sharing in this moment, just like I would have if my dad had been sitting there with me and my mom when we talked about it.  Uggghhh.  

 I hate my job, especially after what they pulled after my daughter was born, and I think my spouse will buy me quitting to go out of state -especially if I promise or at least imply that I'm down with her college plans and will get another job asap after I return. Wife pays daycare for our daughter out of her paycheck so I'm sure she'll be happy to not have to pay that while we're out of state. Son will miss the last six/seven weeks of school but that's okay. 

God, this won't be easy. I need to talk to my brother and a lawyer in this state and home state. My sister in law is very pregnant with twins, I'm sure my brother will be okay lying and saying they need me to come help them out and for the kids to come too to keep my nephew company."
1962,"Reading it likes this helps a lot, thank you. I'm glad I posted here."
1963,ALL OF THIS. I was struck reading your post that everything is about him. Would you tolerate this if they weren't trans? It sounds like you are raising the kids and doing all the housework and looking after him.  Seriously - fuck that.
1964,Don‚Äôt forget your partner thinks children are accessories that can be created for the purpose of appeasing their vanity.
1965,"This. Also, it sounds like OP has another child, not a spouse."
1966,"Completely agree with Tmikthnx2 here, without the gender stuff in the mix this person is parasitical, they are expecting you to do everything and appear to view all the money as theirs. So on that basis alone you have grounds to feel used and leave. They are also racking up debt which will get worse and you need to be away from that crap especially with a child.

&#x200B;

So here is the gender bit. IMO this is just an exhibition of male privilege, notable is the fact that he  doesn't take on any of the 'women's work' (it isn't women's work but in a patriarchal society is often seen as such) while also eschewing what he sees as 'male work'. He is taking you for a ride, a fully paid all inclusive ride.

&#x200B;

You need to leave, for you and for your child who shouldn't grow up seeing you being used in this way.  I wish nothing but the best for you and recommend you look at feminist chat on Mumsnet (a forum) there is a transwidows support thread there, largely left alone. The women there are amazing and supportive, they will be there for you. I'll link you if you want. Take care OP - I'm rooting for you."

1971,I second this! If you read the thread you will see that this behaviour from your spouse is super typical and will NOT improve. He will keep spending all the money on himself. What a shame this compulsion to be seen as female never leads to them having a drive to do housework or child care...
1972,At what point can the OP sue for this trans bullshit brainwashing that has been pushed on society? This is clearly causing major problems for the society. And how on earth does this work according to marriage? Shouldn't this completely violate the marriage contract?

1974,"He sounds like an entitled male, forcing his wife to pay for his voluntary participation in the artificial, obscenely expensive, and sometimes painful aesthetic rituals of femininity (like waxing) which are themselves the products of male imagination and the invaluable tools of patriarchy imposed on every female since birth to keep her poor, self-doubting, and sexually appealing to the male gaze..."
1975,"I don't think she'd dump me; I do think she's going to continue racking up credit card debt even after it's paid off because she needs a new dress or another pair of shoes or a designer purse that she flat out says she wants to get after I receive my trust fund. I'm not spending thousands of dollars on a purse, no matter if it increases in value or not or could be a heirloom for our daughter. 

I can't have a real conversation about money or our debt with her without her bringing up the fact she's trans and that excuses how bad she is with money now. She was way more frugal before. It's so exhausting."

1978,"I'm picking that book up from the library tomorrow, thank you. 

I hate the state we live in, and I definitely want to move back to the Midwest where the rest of my family is. We'd talked about moving there here and there before, because of how cheap it is to live, but of course it was off the table after wife became wife, because she was worried about her safety and the safety of me & the kids.  

Our financial situation is such that our joint account has about two months worth of bare basic rent/utilities/food money in it, and that's it so I'm not super worried about her draining it. We talked about merging bank accounts here and there but have never really gotten around to it because it wasn't that important to either of us. My brother is fully willing to loan me money for a lawyer, and I'm sure he'd be willing to loan me more if needed especially with how close I am to getting my trust fund."
1979,"> This is so gross and extreme it almost looks fake.

I wish. I didn't include the good parts of the marriage and her, just the things that really really bothered me. I didn't bother to include any of the good, because none of the good bits matter. I'm done."
1980,"There‚Äôs a trans widow blog on our sidebar. If you read it chronologically, you see the change the marriage went through. This author also did a TED talk."
1981,I just came here to recommend this. I'm sure the OP will find it relatable.
1982,Definitely make notes about the time you went out of town and he brought in an unknown 'friend' to help
1983,"Everything you said Dexters, sound advice - OP should be extremely careful cutting off a narcissistic from *his* financial goals with *her* money. It won't be pretty, and he probably will fight for custody so he can play SAHM.

Very much plan quietly, as others have said. That would include deleting this thread within less than 24 hours.

ps - I just signed up to reply to your comment"

1990,"His being trans matters because everyone's gaslighting her as the abusive one or the jerk who will not support the ~woman he's brave enough to be~ and that takes a mental and emotional toll, at the least. Somewhere between ""will you be an ass who abandons a spouse who was diagnosed with cancer"" and be treated as a social pariah for being A HATEFUL TRANSPHOBE. Manipulative and emotional blackmail SMH"
1991,It DOES matter if her partner is trans. Read that part about her partner wanting to breast feed her baby. HE is going to be exposing the baby to a variety of potentially dangerous chemicals excreted through breast milk.
1992,I think so to. Basically the autogynephile is in love with the feminine version of himself. When ppl deny this fantasy it‚Äôs as if you molested the wife of a normal heterosexual man. Actual women are just wombs because they think they are so much better than us they can replace us in every field.
1993,">Don‚Äôt feel bad. Your partner is not a partner. You carry all the load while they play dress up and spend money. Tell him to go find himself a sugar daddy.

All the advice can be summed up with this. Move on sister. We're here to support you. Get a divorce. This dude in a dress is a leech."
1994,">It's almost as if the man is trying to become the image of the woman he wishes his wife would be. 

More like the woman he jacks off to while watching porn. You know it's AGP and totally sex-fueled when their image of 'woman' is this highly sexualized caricature. It's not 'I want to live as a regular woman, saggy belly, warts and all, doing domestic chores', but 'I want to live as the hot fuck~~woman~~girl in stilettos and sexy clothes, giving myself erections 24/7'."
1995,"There's some medications that make everyone lactate, like some anti-depressants. I can't imagine that it's particularly healthy though."
1996,They use drugs (domperidone) with manual stimulation and sometimes a breast pump to induce lactation. The discharge they get is nowhere near the quality or quantity of actual mother's breastmilk.
1997,">He even told me the kids feel like adopted kids because he didn't give birth to them, so it's hard to bond with them.

I am actually speechless. I feel horrible for you, but even worse for your kids. Please tell me you have a plan to leave this man?"
1998,"It matters because he uses being trans to drain her money, use the children as props and emotionally manipulate OP and socially isolate her. But I get what you're saying, it's red flags regardless."
1999,\^\^Cannot stress this enough.
2000,I am sure OP will need CBT therapy herself after she escapes. Better to spend her money in her mental health and he can spend his money on his. The OP needs to leave as soon as possible.

2006,"This woman is trying to leave an abusive narcissist. She should not give him ANY clue anything has changed until it's a *fait accompli.* Pushing back on small things like lawn mowing will only clue him in that she's thinking about getting out from under his thumb. This will put her in literal danger.

OP, best of luck to you. Please stay safe and don't give your spouse any HINT in advance that you're not prepared to take this abuse any longer. Get your legal and financial ducks in a row, plan your timing carefully, and the get yourself and your kids to safety."
2007,"and start calling him ""he."""
2008,"Men do have some milk ducts, and some mammary tissue, and *theoretically* they can produce milk - either due to taking drugs that induce lactation, or because it is a symptom of breast cancer, etc. 

However, so little is even really known about the components of women‚Äôs breast milk beyond we know that it has benefits for babies immune systems and so on beyond the colostrum stage (another example of how medicine ignores women for most part), that it is just negligent in my opinion to feed a baby male breast milk with so much unknown about its quality and how it compares to women‚Äôs breast milk. Also, women need to produce a LOT of milk for their babies (and if they can‚Äôt, the baby is at risk of being undernourished if they don‚Äôt switch to formula); I would be surprised if men can do that given they do have a lot less milk ducts and mammary tissue. Can you imagine one of these selfish men, like OPs husband, feeding a baby every 2-3 hours for half an hour or more around the clock? Or dealing with a baby not latching or needing to take an hour each time to get the amount the baby needs then getting an hour before having to go again?

Oh yeah, and then there is the whole they would be passing the drugs they need to induce lactation to the babies. It is all about the men‚Äôs fee fees, and not about the best interests or health of the child. 

A woman who was ‚Äústarving‚Äù her baby of milk and nutrients because she could not produce enough milk would be vilified; she is also often vilified if she switches to formula because of the same. But a man who can squeeze out some droplets of milk of uncertain quality - possibly contaminated with drugs - is so brave and stunning!

Women who haven‚Äôt given birth at all or not recently can also breastfeed by inducing lactation, though it can be easier if they have prior experience. Women used to act as milk nurses to other women‚Äôs babies (either as the mothers would not or could not breastfeed, of they were dead from childbirth/died during the child‚Äôs infancy). Sometimes the milk nurses would have to leave their own babies behind or undernourished to do this, or have even lost their own babies, but sometimes they either had no children or had them long ago, and were able to stimulate lactation with suckling, a baby‚Äôs cry, etc. Pre-formula, this was often the only chance a baby with a dead mother, or mother who could not feed, had."
2009,"The stuff that comes from a male's milk ducts is so nutritionally void that it should not even be called 'milk'. It fills their stomach but does not change according the the child's needs as it grows, or provide antibodies to help develop their immune system. It's a purely selfish act to deny his own child essential nutrients to validate his breastfeeding fetish."

2021,It belongs here because this woman is about to go head to head against the trans cult. A cult which will Attempt to gaslight her and convince her she is a horrible human being for not staying with her transitioning spouse.

2025,"It‚Äôs not that they can‚Äôt or need someone to do it, it‚Äôs that they *won‚Äôt*, and it is surprising to me how many women I have met seem to accept this or just fill in for them, sometimes at first to be the Perfect Girlfriend or Perfect Wife (TM) but then continue on even when they resent it as they don‚Äôt want fo fight about it or he ‚Äúworks so hard!‚Äù If he is going to fight with you about fact you won‚Äôt wash *his* dirty underwear we all know who the ridiculous one in this scenario is. Also, you know who else works hard? Almost everyone. Even on 12+ hour workdays someone can push a few buttons on a washing machine. Women do this all the time. So too can a man who claims he works harder than everyone.

I am with you, I find it incredibly bizarre when men ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù or won‚Äôt do laundry or wash dishes or any other chore. Maybe it‚Äôs because any man I have dated lived on their own at some point, and many came from single mother homes, but they have all been able to make the bed, do laundry, wash dishes, scrub toilets, etc. I have zero patience for men who believe their penis interferes with their ability to operate a washing machine.

Even worse than a man who won‚Äôt do their laundry is one who will *only* launder the clothes they wear and not the household stuff or kids laundry, too. No. 

Also can‚Äôt imagine why any grown man should need a ‚Äúchore chart‚Äù but on advice forums where women are looking for advice with a male partner not doing work around the house that seems to always be the overwhelming advice. I am pretty sure if I was living with a grown man where he needed a chore chart to do basic adulting like taking care of his habitat, I would not be sleeping with that man ever again. Nothing kills my libido quite like a man who needs to be treated like a child."

2033,">""lack of support for her"" (because, you know, I was 100% concerned about the baby's needs as well as the money) 

Think about this also in the bigger context. Rather than putting the baby's needs first, it's all about that ""validation"". The baby's needs come first, and if that's not how it is now, how will it be in the future? What's that going to teach the kid about their parent and how they should expect to be treated?

2036,"Again putting aside the gender transition: if your children are your first priority, as you state, then **you are your children‚Äôs first line of defense.** I have three hetero female friends who are all leaving their husbands with children and every one of them is coming to the clear realization that **he does not have your children‚Äôs best interest at heart or in mind,** The trans stuff is irrelevant. His behavior and choices are telling you what his priorities are and whose best interest he has in mind: HIS. **Believe people when they show you who they are.** It is your responsibility as a parent to have your children‚Äôs best interest as a priority and to protect them from those who do not have their best interest at heart. It doesn‚Äôt matter *who* it is you are protecting them from. Your children need you to make good and right choices for them. They need you to protect them. Not protecting them can do a lifetime of damage. **Protect your children from those who do not have their best interest at heart** You are all they have in this whole world."
2037,"Given a lot of what I have seen your daughter may even be in danger of your partner being jealous of that first period and resenting her for it. I see a lot of TiM online lamenting the loss of their 'girlhood' and fetishising it so the temptation to live vicariously through your daughter could well be strong. Shut that shit down now. Start the process privately now, get what you need together and remove yourself from this toxic situation before it affects your self-confidence (if it hasn't already) and your daughters."
2038,"If you were in a normal, non-abusive relationship, you wouldn't have to lie to get away. You are not. This is not a normal man you're leaving. You need to get out and you can use any means necessary of doing so. If you need to lie, then lie."

2040,">Will wife make her feel bad for any of that? Like my daughter is less than a girl?

I have an narcissistic (not diagnosed, I just see a lot of tendencies in him that are the same as narcissistic personal disorder) father that I left very recently, and this is one of the main reasons. I was told that because I didn‚Äôt want to wear dresses as a toddler, he gave up on ‚Äúspoiling‚Äù me because I wasn‚Äôt girly enough for him.

It sounds like outside of being trans, your SO is selfish and/or narcissistic. Please, please, take it from my experience‚Äîhe will hurt your daughter with exactly what you‚Äôre fearing. He, like my father, only cares about how what happens to others affects *him.* 

I don‚Äôt say this to scare you or to have some witch hunt against your husband. My father wasn‚Äôt trans, but he acted in much the same narcissistic ways as your husband is now acting (not helping you with anything, taking care of himself at your great expense, and looking at a possible future baby as an accessory for himself). I say this because I was essentially in what you fear to soon be your daughters shoes, and I can tell you that yes, it will fuck her up. To attack her on such a level as her femininity like that‚Äîit will fuck her up. Trust me."
2041,"I'm so sorry all this is happening to you. I would reiterate what everyone else is saying here: speak to your lawyer and only speak to trusted family members.

You need to preserve yourself so you can be there for your kids."

2046,"Your fears about how he will treat your daughter are entirely justified. I can only be grateful my father didn't transition until I was in my late teens and finally feeling some confidence in my gender-non-conforming approach to womanhood. Nevertheless, I was still deeply wounded by the way he treated me: comparing his femininity to my lack of it, ""helpfully"" explaining to me how to be a better woman, lashing out and targeting my insecurities when he felt I wasn't supportive enough. He even tried to make me take prenatal vitamins despite my being outspokenly childfree and not fucking pregnant, ""just in case"". The blatant womb envy might be what fucked me up the most.

My heart aches when you talk about how he's already treating your daughter. Please get her away from him. When she's older, she can make her own decision about how involved she wants him to be in her life, but right now you need to remove her from his toxicity for her mental and emotional wellbeing."
2047,"Yes, do what you need to do for your children. It sounds to me like your future success is their future success. Because it doesn't seem like your husband shares his time or money with his family. 

Good luck with your plan!"
2048,"Get out now.  The sooner you can start establishing your life separate from him the better off you all will be. I know you are worried about what will happen as your daughter gets older, but one of the things you have going for you is that your husband is a lazy bastard.  He's gonna fight for you hard for custody now, only because he wants to be a perpetual victim. Your custody fight will feed his narcissistic need But when the dust settles and he finds out how much work raising children is, he'll start missing a weekend here and there. Something will""come up"", it always does for fathers like this. You will enroll your daughter is soccer and buy her pants and tee shirts. Not the fun dresses and cheer classes he wants. This is a war of attrition. Nudge him out of her life, don't push. By the time she becomes a teenager you will likely be remarried and modeling normal relationships. He will still be playing dress up and complaining that no one will date him. Play the long game.  And win it"
2049,"It's not dishonest!

2051,You‚Äôre not evil you are protecting yourself and your kids. **Be careful about pulling your kid out of school because if he isn‚Äôt enrolled anywhere or isn‚Äôt being home schooled your ex husband could     go to child services as this is part of that whole no child left behind act**

It's not even yours yet and already she's scheming to keep you poor and out of options (and trapped with her) while she has the opportunities that your relative meant for you. 

Seriously I never post here but all this is so awful and abusive I had to post to you. If your wife was a man, this wouldn't even be a question- this is textbook financial abuse. Financial independence and a good education for a woman is the best thing we can give ourselves and abusive spouses know that and want to keep us under their thumbs like it's the middle ages. She sees this fund is your way out and she wants to keep that from you.

Talk to a lawyer now before you're 30 and you might make it out with these assets intact for you and your kids. Do not have another child with her. And definitely use the money to move away!"
2054,"What jumps out at me most of all is their attitude that children are something to use to enhance their trans experience.    They are literally talking about bringing a child into the world just to *have* so they can feel female.   That is a separate human being with free will and needs and dignity, not a new purse.    That attitude is beyond self centered and it will do a number on a child born into that."

No, I absolutely wouldn't. But everyone and their mother was telling me that she need to do this and that and this other thing for her mental health so it was really easy to justify everything to myself as something she needed.

The reason your husband wants to all of a sudden change the plan about the inheritance is because they sense your out the end of your rope and he wants to makes sure he gets his!! Do you honestly think this person is beyond that type of behavior? Because everything you‚Äôve said so far shows me that they are a self centered, narcissistic who doesn‚Äôt care who they step on as long as they are ‚Äúvalid‚Äù. That‚Äôs you and your children. The breastfeeding? The maternity leave? You know this is ridiculous to the delusional times 1000. Your feelings are valid. Your fear of rude strangers watching your children is valid.

Your spouse has dragged your relationship across that line and a thousand miles past it. You are nowhere near that line anymore. You don't need to stop and think for a single second about if this was your fault and if you should have been able to hold the marriage together. None of it's your fault, and anyone in your position would leave.

Your spouse is using you. You do the housework, you take care of the kids, you do the yardwork, you wash the dishes, you provide emotional support. Now you're about to have some money, and he wants that too.

He's a child who wants everything provided for him and everything to be catered to him so he can indulge this gender fantasy.

And what happens when YOU want something, or YOU have an issue with his friends? He doesn't care. You do all this for him, but he can't be bothered to ask his friends to stop treating you like the help, or to ""allow"" you to use your own money to benefit your career and quality of life.

This relationship is done, and every day you remain in it is wasted. I know it's going to feel bad because there used to be some good times and you wish they could come back again, but those days are over."

Acknowledging that, I can understand paying for new women‚Äôs clothes‚Äîjust as if a person lost 50lbs he would need new clothes‚Äîwithin your budget though. If struggling those items would come from goodwill, etc., not justifying new debt bc it makes him feel better about himself. Most ppl feel better about themselves with fancy clothes and spa treatments‚Äîtoo bad.

2076,"First off, not a lawyer/this is not legal advice. That being said, you need to see a lawyer immediately. If you don't have the money for a lawyer, speak with your brother. This is one of those cases where unfortunately you stand to lose a lot more than what a lawyer might cost to retain. Do not tell anyone except your lawyer and trusted (and I mean *trusted*) family members what you're planning. Money always makes people go a bit crazy, but it gets worse when people have known about the money long enough to make plans for it. With only 6 months until your inheritance vests, you need to get a move on, and fast. Get out to see the lawyer as soon as you can.

There's a lot going on here, so try to carve out a few minutes for yourself tomorrow when you're feeling calm/relaxed (or as calm/relaxed as you're going to be) and jot down absolutely everything you can think of--these added expenditures, your incoming inheritance, whose name the credit card debt is under/whose card was used to rack it up, the timeline of transitioning (has your wife undergone surgery, changed sex markers on official documentation, etc.), what deadlines are impending, etc.--and where you want to go next. Write it all down, then walk away. On Sunday, pick it back up and go over it. Don't look at it when you're angry, because anger can cause you to start fudging facts without noticing. Just keep to facts for the most part.

Your lawyer may or may not need all the details you've included in your post; however, it's always best to walk into a meeting with a lawyer with everything written down on paper so that if you feel rushed or intimidated or overwhelmed etc. you can just refer down to what you've already written. Lawyers *love* organized clients. Organized clients are easy clients. Even if there's an uphill battle ahead of you (and I cannot guess at what will happen next; your lawyer will know far more so listen to them), being an easy client with an uphill battle is much better and easier to deal with than being a difficult client with a slam dunk case.

That being said, you don't need to bow and scrape and run for Ms Congeniality. You just need to show the lawyer that you take the situation seriously. Listen, ask questions when you don't understand something, and make sure you and the lawyer are on the same page before you leave the meeting. Take notes if you need/want to (I always take notes if only to keep my own written record of important meetings, but the lawyer should be taking notes of some kind as well if you forget) but whatever happens, leave knowing what you talked about and what the next steps are or would be (should you retain that lawyer). If you don't understand something, *ask*. Even if it only ends up being a consultation, and you end up with a different lawyer, still try to soak up everything you can.

Ultimately, you don't have much time to shop around, but you do have time to trust your gut. If anything seems off, thank them for their time and move onto the next. Above all else, trust in yourself. Transitioning does not make someone suddenly lose the ability to save money. Transitioning does not make your wife the centre of the universe. You have sacrificed so much for this marriage already. Please don't feel guilty for having the courage and sense to say you won't sacrifice anything more."

I've never experienced this, so take it with a grain of salt (and also perhaps consider approaching r/personalfinance but also take their words with a few grains of salt--these *are* just strangers on the internet, after all) but I think credit card debt might be one of those things that gets split 50/50 in a divorce unless you can extensively prove via receipts and such that it's all your wife/husband's doing. AKA, you need to start filing for divorce immediately.

2081,"Why would your partner dump you? 

They get to spend all the money however they want, they get meals cooked and housework done for them, they get toys (children) provided for their entertainment and then cared for by you.

You are essentially paying your partner to let you be a servant to all of their wants. He gets to play and you get to work.

The mothers I know with mental health difficulties work very very hard to do the best by their children. 

It doesn't matter if it's a real mental illness. If you had a million dollars, how much would your partner spend and how much would they use for the children? If you aren't working together to build a better life for them, then what is the point?

(and not on dressing them up as dolls - gosh I want to cry for your daughter. As a mom of a teenage girl, please save her from this, she only has one childhood and is this what you will allow it to be? Having to tiptoe around her father and be ashamed of her beautiful, natural body & personality? Imagine him trying to 'have the teen girl experience' when she has friends over!!)

They're plotting on how to spend YOUR money, that could benefit your children in so many ways, on stupid shit that only benefits them. Would you accept this behavior if they weren't trans? If they've never taken care of you, your children or your home, do you really think a bunch of money will make them act more responsible and supportive? You deserve better OP. You deserve a partner that contributes equally, wants you to be happy and values you and your children, their behavior makes me think that this wife will destroy you emotionally and financially and is using being trans as a defense and to manipulate you emotionally/financially."

So now we have a calendar list and we just write what house stuff we do on it. Like trash, swept kitchen, mopped, cleaned tub, cleaned fridge. I see my boyfriend and I do pretty much equal shit. Our roommate does nothing but hes never around so its whatever. The mess is primarily ours.

But yeah I couldn't imagine being with someone let alone marrying someone who isnt doing their fair share and helping.

As we speak right now my boyfriend is doing his dishes and the dishes from breakfast that he cooked. Then I'm gunna get up and do the few things of mine. Then I'm gonna sweep, and hes gunna mop lol."

Because that was OPs situation. She married a man who was incapable of helping or being a partner.

She did agree pretty fast but that didn't stop her from talking about how it, and I (even indirectly), was invalidating to her. God, even now she's not putting the baby's needs first. I dress the kids in hardy play clothes so they can *play*, and that includes the youngest getting her brother's hand me downs. I'd rather my daughter be able to run around without having to worry about getting dirty and she's cute no matter what she's wearing. Wife does not agree. Wife wants daughter to be dressed up in cute clothing as much as possible, and will waste money buying pretty expensive stuff. Said stuff isn't conductive to playing, let alone playing in mud which is basically daughter's favorite thing to do. I'm pretty sure at one point my daughter has more clothes then I or my son did combined. If I try to talk to wife about it, I get a giggle and a ""I'm just making up for the childhood I never had!"" And if I push it, there's tears or she asks to be alone.  When I clean out daughter's dresser to donate too small stuff or things she won't wear, I always end up setting aside a good portion of the expensive stuff to consign regardless.

2118,"This is so true and great advice. Like you said, OP, your #1 concern is your kids. It is obvious your spouse's #1 concern is himself. Your trust fund (which is YOURS not his, by the way) can either be used by you to make a better life for yourself and your kids, or it can be wasted and frittered away by your spouse to buy more girly crap and push his way into grabbing YOUR college education for himself (if he is mentally stable enough to actually get through the classes. I would also be wary of him blowing big bucks on tuition, then not putting in the work to pass the classes and graduate).

Since it's obvious your spouse isn't going to put the kids first and is likely going to waste your money, do whatever it takes legal-wise so that you get ALL your money. I'm glad your brother is willing to help with a loan for an attorney. That money is your ticket to improving yourself and your life and therefore improving your kids' lives. This money will also allow you to get away from your spouse, which will also improve your kids lives. It sounds like you are on track to make all this happen, but I just wanted to reinforce the message. Your instincts are excellent. Follow them and don't back down to your spouse. He's already put you through enough and like another poster stated, when someone shows you their true colors, believe them."

Then she gets upset when my daughter wants to go in the backyard and play in the mud and either does so in whatever ""cute"" clothes she's wearing or I help my daughter change into some hand me downs from her brother.   She doesn't even like seeing my daughter wear ""boy"" clothes that previously belonged to my son or nephew.

This is not acceptable behaviour, whether male, female, trans, or whatever, and you know it. 

Please, get some legal advice first thing. Good legal advice because it sounds,like your husband will fight you all the way. And leave.

You've given working things out a good shot, and you've tried longer than most would have at handling him with extra soft kid gloves so he can adjust or whatever that was supposed to do to help him, but his selfish, narcissistic behavior has escalated rather than improved. It is a safe bet he is always going to use his ""lady feels"" as an excuse to be manipulative and grab up the most benefits for himself as possible. You're not so much throwing in the towel on your marriage as you are wising up about a chronic narcissist using guilt and gaslighting to manipulate you and get his greedy hands on YOUR money that was set aside by YOUR relative for YOU to better yourself or provide for yourself, which will in turn better your children's lives."

2151,"Three interesting points about the study at the NCBI link, which was co-authored by a trans activist:

1 - The father maxed at 227 grams per day, while most women produce around 500 grams per day by the time a baby's 5 days old. Some questions are therefore asked about claims that the pediatrician involved found the adopted baby adequately nourished for six weeks on nothing but the father's lactate.

2 - The man's lactate had not been assessed at the time the study was published so it's not known if it had the same mix of components as milk from new gestational mothers.

3 - The father's choice to ingest estrogen, progesterone, spironolacton, and domperidone had unknown effects on the baby. The FDA does not allow domperidone to be sold in the U.S. because it's caused serious heart problems, including fatal ones. The man in the study was able to obtain it because he lives in Canada where the drug remains on the market.

The Milk Junkies post concerns one case, not two. In it, the father, who also chose to pass domperidone and synthetic hormones to his baby through his lactate, reported that he was unable to produce more than a few droplets at the time of the birth, then found the baby couldn't latch on because his breast tissue and nipple couldn't reach the back of the baby's throat until the baby was older and stronger, and after that, nursed in tandem with his wife because neither of them was producing enough milk for the baby.

To quote Patrick Star:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uedw5flJ9M8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uedw5flJ9M8) 

This person is trying to live vicariously through their child. That's messed up no matter what gender you are. Children are people, not things.

You gotta get those kids out of there."
2166,"From here on, do not let your wife know what you are thinking of or planing. I recommend you try and do some reading here for awhile too. r/NarcissisticAbuse"
2167,">She did agree pretty fast but that didn't stop her from talking about how it, and I (even indirectly), was invalidating to her.

You know why it's ""invalidating"" to ""her""? *BECAUSE HE'S A FUCKING MAN!!!* If two lesbians were together and the birth mother breastfed, the other one wouldn't feel 'invalidated'. He feels 'invalidated' because he's *living in a fucking delusion* and then has to face reality.  


You need to stop telling his lies for him. For the sake of your own sanity. He. Him. His. Husband. Soon to be ex-husband."
2168,"Think of it this way, letting your daughter play in the mud is so so good for her brain development. It is sensory, tactile, learning about the physics of the world and her place in it. All those experiences making more synaptic connections, making her confident about her abilities. You are a good mom!

He wants to force her to act a certain way that will STUNT HER DEVELOPMENT for his own... what? Validation? Playing? Vicarious childhood? Does he see your daughter as a full human being in her own right? Does he care?"
2169,"As a girl who grew up (very) gender-nonconforming, this makes me so sad. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve had to put up with this for so long, and I‚Äôm so sorry he‚Äôs dragging your daughter down with you. A little girl is not a dress-up doll. That kind of forced femininity is damaging at best, traumatizing at worst. Not to mention, is this the kind of mentality you want your son growing up with? Wishing you and your kids the best. Trans or not, what a manipulative narcissist; get out of there ASAP, for your sake and theirs."
2170,"Yes. He‚Äôs definitely trying to get the education and then probably to leave you. Men often suggest another child in a perverse attempt to keep the woman bound to them, even when they leave. 
Re uni: I cannot tell you how many women I know who supported their husbands through school or grad school, with a promise it would be her turn next and it never happened. And/or he dumped her after he got his degree. In one case the woman (admittedly in a stupid move) has ‚Äúhelped‚Äù with the work significantly. So he didn‚Äôt even really earn his degree  grrr. Save yourself!"
2171,"My grandmother left me $5000 when she died, she wanted me to use it for college. She didnt even finish high school and was so proud of my older girl cousins who had degrees. It kills me to think of that money getting completely wasted on something like someone else's skin care and clothing when it was meant to help me leverage an opportunity. That's the height of selfish to me."
2172,">God, I can't even imagine how it's going to be when my daughter is a teenager. :/

For the love of all things holy get out of there before she gets anywhere near that age."
2173,"A child growing up with a mentally ill parent who thinks the child is a toy will have to be in therapy their whole adult life, but if you leave now you can prevent so much damage."
2174,"This is sick and abusive dude, like. What? 

I think you need to take the kids, go to your parents, whatever and divorce this person stat."
2175,"Sounds like he is objectifying your daughter...he doesn't see her as a full person who has diverse personal interests of her own, like playing in the mud sometimes, just a little doll for him to play dress up with. What do you mean, he doesn't like it when he sees her in her brother's hand-me-downs? Let me guess, is it *dysphoric* for him? Gender Nazis drive me insane so I'll hold myself back from ranting. This story is enraging me. 
You sound like you have a lot of pressure and demands on you, and you need to be honest with yourself and question: if my husband does not help me and in fact seems to add stress and burden to my life at every turn, how much can he really care about me? Or the children for that matter. 

Please do not let him steal your future. You have a rare gift coming in the form of that trust money, and it is *yours* not his. Judging by the amount of things you anticipate accomplishing with the money, I'm guessing it's quite a large sum. *Do not let him get a degree before you* And please, please, think long and hard about bringing another child into this situation. It sounds like another baby on top of all this would be unbearable."
2176,"That's not good for your child either. OP you have been brave asking for advice here, be brave again for your daughter (easy to say but not easy to do I know)."
2177,Your husband sounds very sexist too.
2178,"Stop buying dresses.  Stop putting them on. You do the laundry right. Every time an outfit that he likes goes in to the laundry...make it disappear. Or put a big stain on it.  Or tear it.  Eliminate his choices. The more you restrict his options, the better you all are."
2179,This!!!!!!!
2180,Right like wanting to pseudo breastfeed when it in no way helps the baby? What even?
2181,"I wish I had been a child of divorce. Even as an adult, I wish my mum would leave my dad. I begged her as a teenager, as did my brother, to take us away. It takes a lot of courage, which she didn‚Äôt have, but god it would have been better in the long run for both of our mental health states."
2182,Not sure divorce works like that. Suing a big corporation is more likely to get that deal
2183,"LOL. No. I'm an attorney. I want to get paid. 

But you can sit down and go over costs and decide how you want to proceed. Don't let an attorney pressure you into something, and get a good idea of how much the cost of representation will run. 

Most attorneys will take payment plans."
2184,"Oh, so that's her. She got published, I guess that explains why she'd have to scrub her blog :D

The comment on that yt link:

>""The person she talked about is either not even trans or she is misrepresenting the story (or prob both).""

Of course. ‚óî_‚óîÔªø It's ""I am what I say I am"" until it turns ugly and it's suddenly 'fake trans'.

Good for Thrace and OP for having the guts and resources to get out of their misery. Can you imagine the abuse other women who are dependent and cannot get out would have to put up with? Fuck, that's hell."
2185,[deleted]
2186,Some of you are no different than rabid conservatives and liberals. Learn to be accepting of people with varying opinions or no one will want to support your cause.
2187,"Buuut... I wanted to be sassy. Both you and the OP used the word ""cynical"" and the connection was obvious. I didn't call you a thought traitor, that's far more of a leap. And yeah, you can wonder... but it'd be more helpful to point out why the story seems suspect. Considering that I have heard similar stories of abusive relationships between plain ol' boring men and their wives, I don't know what about this makes you suspicious."
2188,"As I said, IN OTHER COMMENTS.

And you conveniently left out all the other parts of the OP that stated their partner did next to nothing before the transition, and now does even less because the more traditionally masculine roles ""trigger them""


""Despite her eagerly embracing the ""momma bear"" attitude since practically the first moment she told me she was trans, our child care and household chore duties have barely changed at all before and after transition. She still goes to the gym straight after work while I pick up the kids and go home to make dinner. Except now she's got a really cute gym bag and exercise outfits and sends me a cute selfie or two of herself while she's there.

She still gets home, eats dinner with us, then hangs out in the kitchen with me and the kids while I do the dishes and clean up. She tells me about her day. I like this part honestly, but I wish she would¬†help¬†because it would get done a lot faster if both of us were doing it.

She won't mow the lawn or do the outside chores any more -it gives her mental distress to do the household activities she did before she transitioned. So now I do all those in addition to most of the inside chores.""

Then OP put the comment you pasted where they talk about how they're still doing their partners laundry, as they always have,as an example of how they're still expecting her to do everything as it was before.

Also, OPs partner is technically a man regardless of whatever fantasies they have. I appropriately gendered their pre transition behavior, and was gender neutral discussing the rest which is more than what most people here to do so you're really arguing with the wrong person dude."
2189,Undoubtedly.
2190,"Christine's book is great, and, OP, there's a happy ending to her story! She ended up remarried to a supportive person and they are raising her kids together."
2191,"God the first post I just looked at on there is this one, http://np.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/bhskbj/covert_narc_tricks_says_thats_weird_to_things_i/ and it hits so close to home. She doesn't ""that's weird"" me, but anything I say she almost always just writes me off somehow in a way that makes me feel like she can't wait for me to stop talking to her. I thought I was imagining it over and over but I think I'm not. 

She didn't used to be like this; she used to care what I had to say and reacted like it. Thank you for that subreddit, I'm definitely going to be reading a lot there."
2192,This is a trust though. The whole point of a trust is to protect the money from situations like this. She needs to talk to the trustee and ask him or her to play hardball.
2193,this^^ female childhood/puberty/adolescence is bad enough without someone actively enforcing harmful stereotypes with no regard to the child‚Äôs mental health
2194,"Right. Normally i advocate for letting equal parts in raising a child in divorce (courts mostly give custody to mothers) but in this instakce absolutely this person doesnt need to be the primary caregivers. And honestly, if beong trans is a fetish (which i personally believe so), OPs husband is actively involving children in this by bringing their trans friends to the hoyse to babysit."
2195,I sincerely hope this gets better for you. Learn from your parents' mistakes - that's the best thing this situation can do for you.
2196,"It doesn‚Äôt work for divorce lawyers, it‚Äôs against our ethical rules."
2197,"Not in all states, but I know some will take the case without payment up front because she will be getting the trust fund."
2198,"I don't understand why these people can't wrap their minds around the fact that being trans does not also automatically make you a good person lol regardless of how the OP's partner identifies, they're clearly a shitty, selfish human being - that is a part of who they are and does not suddenly disappear just because they're trans.  Even the most gungho activist should be lucid enough to admit that trans people can be shitty just like anyone else, but here we are LOL."
2199,"No worries, that came across clear. It just reminded me of that JustNoMIL post where everyone was telling the woman it didn't matter if her abusive MIL was a TIM. It's like, wot, dude can easily overpower her if he upped his abuse. There are situations when being a TIM makes a lot of difference."
2200,"Don't support ""our cause"" but *the* cause you agree with regardless of who advocates for it. And don't be a shit in a sub you only half-agree with.

2202,"You are most welcome. I hope you continue to find it helpful, partly because it will help make it clear that the trans issue is only the mask a narcissist is wearing, and partly to help you know the support you got here was not just a biased point of view. It will also arm you with clear thoughts as you free yourself from the abuse you are suffering. 

When you first meet a narcissist they approach their target with ""love bombing"" to create join up. They also mirror all the things you love and care about to help the bonding cement. Then they start the ""negging."" *(subtle negative comments to break down your self esteem so you will tolerate their abuse)* It may appear he was not always like this, but this doesn't develop as a personality disorder later in life. It's been there since early childhood. There can be things that cause it to be more intense as apposed to other times, like life's demands, but it's been there, hiding. They love to hook in sensitive, ethical people. People who will think long and deep before doing something like say... file for divorce. :p 

Feel free to private message me or post here or that other sub again. It's ok to get a lot of support. üòä ‚ô°üåπ‚ô°

2203,Well before you were the woman he loved. Now he‚Äôs the woman he loves.
2204,"I agree I think for some ppl its definitely a fetish. What's concerning to me in that end is that this person wants to wear the little girls clothes and gets mad when she dresses normal or plays outside ?? And wanted to bullshit breastfeed? And wants a baby just to play some BS motherhood fantasy instead of trying to connect with the children they already have??? 

Then there's also a huge correlation between sexual abuse in childhood and trans, and for men we see that a lot of those who were abused tend to do some abusing later on. So I'd be concerned with this person just bringing a bunch of random trans ppl to the house. Who knows what could happen. 

And since the lines of appropiateness is already very blurred with OPs partner and the children, they could easily do something that's considered inappropriate without even realizing it cause their sense of it is so warped."
2205,"It gets better for me as I emotionally distance myself from my family! I‚Äôm just glad I‚Äôm a lesbian tbh. Risk factor for ever being in the same situation goes way down.

Women are people that feel a certain way, emotionally.

Women are people that like traditionally feminine activities

Women are people that wear skirts

Women are people that feel feminine.


All those notions of womanhood rely on clich√©s and tropes in order to define how one can feel like a women. They are all sexist; women can feel anything, do anything, wear anything, what defines them as a woman is none of that rubbish, it is their biology. 

Women and girls around the world don't suffer FGM, violence, and rape at catastrophic rates because they feel like women, it's because of their biology, and they cannot identify their way out of that reality."

Nobody gives a shit. 

Traditional gendered behaviour and characteristics are sexist. If I feel drawn to traditionally female activities, feel better in women's clothes, or do any other number of things traditionally gendered as feminine but have a penis, then I am a man with interests outside the traditional prescribed social norms of masculinity. Prescribed femininity has been used as an oppressive tool forever, and 'female' is not a feeling. We should be moving away from gendering things, not doubling down on it to appease a small number of people. Break the conventions, don't reinforce them! 

If gender and sex are both real, but quite distinct as you suggest, why the current desire amongst many trans identifying people to attempt to align the two via major surgical procedures?

Read about gender dysphoria, read about autogynephilia, and stop parroting meaningless gender studies nonsense.

 And I didn't even have call you an asshole."

2288,"I do like what you say about not reinforcing conventions. I guess you even kind of changed my mind a little bit because I do agree that those conventions need to be abolished and that the desire to become the opposite sex is really just reinforcing the gendering of things. However in my opinion if somebody really wants to do/wear/embrace traditionally feminine things even though they have a penis, I don't see them as a man outside the traditional prescribed social norms of masculinity per se, but instead I think that they are just doing whatever the fuck they want to.

Though I must admit I too think that in an ideal world nobody would even feel the need to change their gender and attempt to align their sex with it as well as you said so nicely.

Perhaps I judged this sub too harshly, I am just the kind of live and let live type of person and I was shocked by the transphobia here. I still don't really get it though, are trans people really the problem here? The way I see it you don't like gendering either so why go after trans folks when their goal is not to reinforce gender goals but to just be able to live with themselves in this cruel gendered world? Why not focus on actually taking down the concept of the two genders, eliminating the need for trans inclusion all together?

Also I apologise for saying you were assholes, I guess you're ok."
2289,"And what did I ever do to trans people? I value single sex spaces, and believe some activities are best divided by sex. Not interested in your lazy strawman arguments. Look how basic your comment is. Zero nuance or appreciation of the debate that's going on, just 'ThEy'Re jUsT lIViNg ThEiR LiFe!!' and other such vacuous rubbish."
2290,"I definitely agree with that particular point. And that could be what they were intending with the quotes. I just took it as a mild argument against the post and felt it was worth drawing attention to the fact that ""currently female"" bodies aren't a thing. There are the bodies of females, the bodies of males and the bodies of individuals with sex-related birth defects.

But I definitely agree that it makes a ton of difference for sports especially. Women shouldn't be forced to compete against men or even other women who have been taking testosterone. I'm pretty sure men who are taking testosterone and playing would be considered to be cheating.

Trans people should have their own leagues. Women have their own leagues for very important (and obvious) biological and safety reasons. The same very reasonable arguments apply to trans people. If you're either male or taking drugs that act as performance enhancers, you definitely shouldn't be playing against other women.

So definitely no TIMs or TIFs in women's leagues. I'm not sure how I feel about TIFs in men's leagues. I don't know if the testosterone would give them an advantage over men. I'm guessing it would at best even out. So allowing TIFs or even normal women to play in men's leagues seems pretty reasonable to me if that's what they wanted to do. I still think separate leagues is probably the best solution though.

This is all because we were too sympathetic to push back against the phrase ""transwomen are women"". No one actually believes it but we allowed it to be polite to people with mental illness. And now we're flying down that slippery slope. At least people are peaking in droves and pushing back now. I think it's only a matter of time until we can go back to normal. But we have to keep pushing back.

Edit: Sorry, I've been in a long-winded ranting mood today lol. <3"
2291,Ehh no worries and thank you for looking! I‚Äôm trying to sticky new posts every week and that one sounded so good. But I‚Äôll throw something together later to get the gist across :)
2292,"Womanhood is not a complex thing unless your trying to find some way to squish TIM‚Äôs into the definition of woman. 

Is describing human beings as bipedal a complex thing because some people have no legs? Are they a different species or a different type of human?

Or do we use common sense and realize 99% of the populations is male or female. There are abnormalities of genitalia, but those have nothing to do with identity. No matter how many ways you categorize sex (by hormones, internal organs, genitalia, chromosomes) the results are the same. 

A woman having and losing a uterus is only further proof she is a biological woman. A man never having a uterus stands to the same logic. Observing the physical reality of male sexed and female sexed bodies is not sexist. It is science, it is how you and I were both made. 

What IS sexist is saying that female sexed bodies must be feminine in action and in mind, and that any male that is feminine is a female. This is the trans ideology viewpoint. They claim a preference for femininity is inborn and is found in the brain (false) and every female must relate to or abide by femininity to self describe as a woman. This is what your defending?"
2293,"Working towards eliminating stereotypical notions of gender is undoubtedly something most people in this group are entirely on board with. Whilst individual trans people may not be 'the problem', the idea that one can 'feel' like a women reinforces the notion that there is a stereotypical way women feel. Female/woman, whatever you want to call it is not a feeling. 

Personally I have a lot of sympathy for anyone suffering gender dysphoria, the feeling of not being truly connected to ones own body must be incredibly distressing, and I sometimes find the language used by people on here to refer to trans individuals pretty 
Unpleasant.

But all of this aside, women in this group feel that certain hard earned women's rights have the potential to be completely eroded if we are to accept that female is not an immutable birth feature, but is actually just  a feeling. Men will, and already are, abusing this in order to harm women. This is just a fact. Again i am not demonising trans people here, I'm trying to illustrate how people with malicious intent will abuse the ability to access women's spaces in order to abuse women. 

You sound like you're trying to worksome stuff out yourself, and I wish you all the best with that. Please try and be kind to women that are ultimately trying to safeguard other women.

2294,"Why should the leagues need to be separate? Trans women may have a slight advantage (and I do mean *slight*), but any such advantage is much smaller than the advantage that, say, tall people have in  basketball. A trans women who hasn't taken hormone blockers and estrogen does have a large advantage, but one who has hormone levels consistent with those of a cis female has almost no advantage."
2295,[removed]
2296,"Trans people aren't saying that female is an immutable birth feature. Trans women are born with brains that are wired the same way as cis women. It's the other way around for trans men. It's not a feeling, it's caused by the way the brain is wired.

While men may use this to harm women, it doesn't increase the amount abuse happens. It's just a man gets caught and tries to think of an excuse, and uses trans people for it. Even the ""bathroom predator"" idea is a myth."
2297,"The advantage might be slight in some sports (running primarily) but in most sports it's significant. Bone density and grip strength in particular gain men significant natural advantages over women in complex physical activities. Google ""grip strength men vs women"" and you'll see a bunch of medical journal articles about it. The average neckbeard in his mother's basement has a higher grip strength than Serena Williams despite grip strength being a central necessity for her domination of her sport.

Men and women are physically very different in many different ways. Cross-sex hormones don't actually turn someone into the opposite sex. They mimic some aspects of the opposite sex but there are many that they can't address. I mean, just think of male hand size vs. female hand size in the WNBA. Many average men (myself included) can palm a woman's basketball with little effort. That alone is a significant advantage.

Nope. We have different leagues for men and women for a reason. They have rules about taking drugs for a reason. Trans people who want to compete can do so in their own leagues just like men and women do. Women's leagues should not have to accommodate men in order to validate their identity."
2298,[deleted]
2299,"Bone density doesn't grant a large advantage in any sport. It also increses with feminizing hormone therapy, and trans women are at higher risk for osteoporosis.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6709704/

Grip strength definitely decreases due to hormones. While trans women are near the top (about 90th percentile), that's after only about a year. It decreases faster as time goes on. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6652261/


Almost every aspect of the opposite sex can be attained, and most can be attained through hormone therapy. The only ones that don't change are genitals, bone structure (if taken after puberty), bone density (only for trans men), an chromosomes. Bone structure and genitals can both be altered through surgery. Hand size does actually decrease.

Hormone replacement is effective at removing essentially every male advantage that trans women have. It doesn't give trans men the full male advantages. We have rules against taking drugs that increase performance. Feminizing hormone therapy has the opposite effect. While testosterone does give advantages for trans men over women, they are on average weaker than most male athletes, but still strong enough to be able to compete."

2302,"Exactly! Wear and do whatever feminine you want but you aint a woman, and whats wrong with being a man and wanting to be feminine? Why cant you just accept yourselves and the reality?"
2303,I wish this could be printed on huge posters.
2304,P R E A C H!! So tired of that movement devaluing what a woman is and then silencing actual women!!
2305,"To me, it‚Äôs important to point out that male fetishization of pregnancy and female experience of pregnancy are NOT the same thing, not only for the obvious, but also because the male obsessed with ‚Äúbeing pregnant‚Äù/‚Äújealous of women who can get pregnant, women who can get pregnant are privileged so you‚Äôre not allowed to talk about it‚Äù and the woman obsessed with being pregnant, have very different motivations.

The woman wants to become pregnant because she wants to become a mother. She wants to have a child and raise it; the pregnancy itself may be a joyful or a harrowing experience for her, or something in between, but ultimately is only a step on the path to being a parent.

The male fantasizes about pregnancy itself. He fetishizes the physical feeling of getting pregnant and carrying a fetus to term and going into labor. It‚Äôs the same motivation behind the obsession with menstruation. Women worry about access to sanitary supplies, getting endometriosis taken seriously, etc.; males obsess over the bleeding and blood itself, heaviness/lightness not being so much as a health concern as an individual distinction, and, because their idea of womanhood is so warped, they think we see it that way, too.

Just because you want to get pregnant/menstruate doesn‚Äôt make you a feminist or progressive or, for fuck‚Äôs sake, a woman."

You know that women need different training regimes for sports to men, as otherwise we get complications that men don't? No one bothered to research that until recent years, took yet another woman to be bothered to find that out.

There's a litany of research that just bypasses women and sees us as diminutive men. So if it's been researched in men, just knock it down a bit and apply to women, right?

So if all the social stuff listed by the op does not convince you, maybe actual medical research (or lack of) will."

2430,Thank you for this wording. I support all viewpoints but this helps clarify my thoughts that feeling wrong in your own skin doesnt mean you need to change genders.  It means you need to break free of feeling bad about your body no matter how it was born.
2431,Talking about biases
2432,"I mean, you're replying to someone who posted that being smart and empathetic is an intrinsically female quality (because they are female)... which is kind of narcissistic, and probably suffering from the same Dunning Kruger effect.

I would argue most people suffer from Dunning Kruger, probably myself as well."
2433,"Also women with three X chromosomes: Trisomy X.

This is why defining woman by reference to the absence of a Y chromosome is a slightly better definition than defining women as having XX chromosomes.  It correctly includes X and XXX women and correctly excludes XYY and XXY men.

But for everyday purposes XX = woman and XY = man is still pretty good, its about 99.8% accurate."

They ban shoes, but dont ban testosterone?

What i mean to say is: Good initiative Idaho. I hope it works for you."
2444,I can't believe there actually has to be a law stating that boys are not allowed to compete in girl's sports! The human animal is getting dumber by the generation.
2445,One State at a time üëç
2446,Good.
2447,The fact that this even has to be done is ridiculous. However you identify doesn‚Äôt change existing physical attributes/strength.
2448,"So this is from Fox News. I think when liberals see how harmful boys and men competing against girls and women is, they will regret allowing conservatives to control the narrative of resistance.

Liberals seem to assume that everything they do is on the right side of history. They are wrong."
2449,Good news. Hope the other states follow.
2450,It shouldn't have taken this long.
2451,"Congratulations to Idaho! And, not least, to the female residents of Idaho."
2452,"Hopefully others will soon follow. About bloody time, which is ridiculous to say. But okay. At least girls and women are being heard."
2453,"The only problem is, we need a much more extensive law that protects ALL female-only spaces...and this maybe providing a band-aid that keeps the more imperative issues out of sight, out of mind. It's easy for everyone to get on board with sports because we're talking about tons of privileged people's daughters in sports, but what about the women in prisons and domestic violence shelters?"
2454,Good for Idaho!! This is good progress.
2455,This is great news. it is not rocket science. Biological boys should not be competing against girls. It is unfair. They are still boys regardless of how many hormones they take or how much makeup they wear.
2456,"""The politically correct and the LGBT community will scream we‚Äôre hurting somebody‚Äôs feelings (as if that should be against the law) but they aren‚Äôt really concerned about how the girls feel.""

2470,"Where are trans women who have been on hormone blockers and hrt altogether supposed to play sports? I mean, if you're gonna complain because they have an unfair advantage against women because men have more muscle, the hormones actually affect muscle size very much."
2471,"And just for the record, it's usually amab men who say that kind of shit, but it's only trans women who go through hormones, family disownment, violence, etc."
2472,"To be fair the IOC do limit testerone to 10 nanomales per litre which is only about 20x more than the average woman, but half the normal man. The IAAF which governs track and field reduced their limit to 5 and had to defend it in court which they won back on May 1, 2019.

I don't think XYs or even intersex people should be competing against XX, but if you're going to use testerone even 5 is way too high. If a woman (XX) was over 2.5 she would likely be under the care of a doctor because it be a sign of other health issues. 

I think we'll get back to the point where people throw their hands up and demand XX for female competitions, but it's going to a masculine looking XY claiming a gold medal on the world stage."
2473,"Totally. I was explaining the whole situation to a man a few weeks ago, and he did the devil's advocate nonsense (as in:
him: ""okay, so you think trans people shouldn't be allowed to compete at all?""... 
me: um, not really. Competing is not a human right. 
him: ""oh, true. so how about if trans people compete in their own league?"" 
me: sure, whatever. 
him: ""but wait, weren't there girls who were excluded from a sport for having naturally high testosterone levels?"" 
me: YES! DOESN'T THAT SUGGEST, INHERENTLY, THAT IF A WOMAN CAN BE EXCLUDED FOR THAT, THEN MALES SHOULD BE EXCLUDED COMPLETELY?""  Sorry for the tangent, but excluding slightly elevated testosterone in natal women but not excluding natal males reminds me of your excluding-shoes-but-not-males anecdote. FFS!"
2474,"I agree that the fact that we‚Äôve gotten to the point where we have to have a law for this is insanity. However, I‚Äôm happy to see that  society is beginning to step up to protect girls from the ridiculousness that has been brewing. I really hope we‚Äôre starting to shift back to using logic. I think people are starting to get really tired of the transcult bs - and even though they‚Äôre terrified to speak out publicly they‚Äôre privately casting their vote."
2475,"IMO, if you transition, you give up your right to compete. Plan and simple."
2476,"Transitioning from boy to girl after puberty means that the person will still have high testosterone levels and she will have all the physical advantage compared to other biological runners, if higher testosterone levels weren't giving you an advantage why do you think steroids are banned in biking"
2477,[removed]
2478,"True. I'm on the left and this is such a pain point in discussions. People think I'm some horrible person because I won't submit to the trans ideology. They don't understand that I'm not being hateful or exclusive, that this issue is much deeper than that and the left is being manipulated into supporting the trans movement, which harms everyone in the end."
2479,"This article is so terribly written.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I support the content - but what lousy journalism.  It reads more like someone‚Äôs ranting opinion piece.  I don‚Äôt know how someone could see this as ‚Äúfair and balanced‚Äù.   It‚Äôs the same writing style they have when talking about every viewpoint... trump, obama,"
2480,"Please don‚Äôt make this an issue about liberals and conservatives. As a very liberal person I still think it‚Äôs bullshit. This should be a bipartisan issue.

Edit: apparently people think I‚Äôm ignorant to what politicians in the US are spouting. That‚Äôs not my argument. Just the other week someone posted on here wondering why so many far-right posters started flocking to this sub.

2483,">It's easy for everyone to get on board with sports

You‚Äôd think so, wouldn‚Äôt you? But that‚Äôs not the case. People are doubling and tripling down on this insanity. Men in women‚Äôs sports are going to keep drawing negative attention to the trans movement for the next few years. Their movement might die on this hill- I hope to fuck it does."

2485,Why? Why can't we all just be ourselves? Our ability to procreate doesn't affect what we choose to do in life. So why force someone who identifies one way to be who they aren't.

2489,Some additional context - the runner on the far right in that photo was banned for two years for doping.  Her physique is not the result of just natural (self-produced) hormones.

2500,Or the TIMs can compete against other men.
2501,YES
2502,"It does decrease physical strength and mass, but not to the level of women athletes. While their testosterone has to be below a certain level to compete, that level isn't low enough, actual women would be banned for doping if they had testosterone that high.

Have you actually seen any videos of transgender athletes competing against women?"
2503,"Agreed. Not questioning the motives behind the trans movement isn't ""wokeness,"" it is willful ignorance."
2504,Libfems have let TRAs dominate feminism. It‚Äôs a liberal issue. I say this as a leftist.
2505,"I totally get where you're coming from - but from where I am, it looks like queer theorists have taken control of the left in America. Gender ideology and leftism is a trope at this point. A significant amount of time and money is spent on pandering to a tiny portion of our population"
2506,But the left is doing this. They've brought it upon us. We have to face this fact. Especially since it feels our own parties are turning on women.
2507,"The right's reasons for resistance against TRA's is very different from radical feminism's reasons for resistance against TRA's. Their central ideology is not centered around protecting women, women's bodily autonomy, and women's safety. They might shroud their hatred as concern for women, but they've shown with their policies and actions that their stances are rooted in hatred and ignorance.

Radical feminism denounces TRA ideology not because we are afraid of change or because we are inherently hateful. We resist TRA ideology because it functions as an extension of misogyny. Talk about misogyny to a right leaning person, and they'll roll their eyes at you. They're not our allies just because they post negative content about transgenderism."
2508,But it isn't a bipartisan issue in US politics. The conservative party uses this as an excuse for bigotted rhetoric against LGB people but isn't legislating against women's protections and rights to their own spaces (however happy they are to strip a woman's right to control what happens with her own body). But every presidential candidate of the liberal party supports legislation that would destroy women's spaces.

2513,"If wearing women's clothing etc. makes a person feel happier then I clearly don't have a problem with that. Who am I to say what a person does or doesn't do? But if you cannot concede that allowing biological men, purely on the basis that they 'identify' as women, to compete in women's sport and to access women's spaces is a dangerous precedent then I have to say you have an overly optimistic view of human nature and of the nature of men in particular. I don't want to diminish dysphoria and the negative effects it has on people's well being but if we accept self-ID as the only category to determine whether a person is allowed to compete in women's sport, access women's spaces, and qualify for positions reserved for women then we are opening a pandora's box of potential abuse by men. For example in my country we have affirmative action that favours women, if self ID is the criterion for claiming womanhood then I could, theoretically, wake up on the morning of thr job interview, put on a dress and make up, claim that I am a woman and qualify for the job. It is even more insidious in sports where men are categorically more athletic than women."
2514,"Even though I'm not like that, I have always preferred states like that. The people and culture tend to be very reserve and more relatable to introverts like me."
2515,"Seriously, even from a pro-trans participation slant 5 is way too high. My testosterone is nearly undetectable after only 6 months of monotherapy. They‚Äôre basically allowing doping no matter how you spin it.

I don‚Äôt think most trans women would even consider testosterone at that level acceptable. Makes you wonder how dysphoric these TIMs really are."
2516,It‚Äôs funny because I can remember China and Russia being accused of sneaking men into their women‚Äôs teams and it was widely regarded as cheating. Tie a trans rights bow around it and suddenly it‚Äôs bigotry to question fairness or safety with males competing with females.
2517,"Exactly why I'm in favor of an xx category. It's a mistake to engage in their delusion and believe that they can actually become women with enough drugs and surgeries.  The xx category doesn't allow any gray area on the types of athletes in the category.

On semi related note I always found it weird that the hive mind on r/2xchromosomes was very trans supportive when most of these people are xy trying to pretend to be xx."
2518,I think that the vast majority don't realize that Semenya is male because it's been tiptoed around so much.
2519,Or against each other
2520,"Or that. It's just unfair for women to have to compete with, not only a body with testosterone, BUT an athlete that used to be the opposite sex. Or gender, or whatever the fuck is politically correct. Non binary fuckin shit whatever"
2521,Agreed.
2522,"Exactly, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying all these posts about ‚Äòliberals‚Äô and ‚Äòconservatives‚Äô don‚Äôt have a place on a bipartisan issue."
2523,"Most conservative people I know personally (myself included) feel pretty similarly to most people here regarding LGB vs T issues. I don't know anyone who has issues with anyone being gay including my elderly relatives. The attitude is pretty much ""It's not hurting anyone, who cares"" but are very against controversial trans issues because they *are* hurting people. Transitioning kids, letting men in women's spaces, etc."
2524,"We are talking about policy in the United States, however."
2525,"That‚Äôs all well and good.. but just the other week someone posted on here wondering why so many far-right posters started flocking to this sub. All I‚Äôm saying is, when you (collective) start with ‚Äòthose damn liberals‚Äô talk, it‚Äôs not surprising that our sub draws alt right posters."
2526,But they aren't men! And there are many afab women who outclass amab men in many sports. So your logic just doesn't hold any weight really.
2527,I get it. I think I would be more comfortable in a purple state. Hard to say for sure. I just like it more when people are actually exposed in their day to day lives with opposing views and learn how to actually deal with that.
2528,"> I don‚Äôt think most trans women would even consider testosterone at that level acceptable.

I'm sure that's true, but unfortunately there are enough mediocre failed male athletes who suddenly find meaning in beating down women that without regulation they won't be kept away. And I also wonder how dysphoric they really are, or if they are just misogynists who hate women so much they feel the need to show the world that they can do ""woman"" better."
2529,"It‚Äôs fucking depressing that you have to specify xx at all. Women are women, trans women are trans women, what‚Äôs the freaking issue? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2530,"PC nonsense.  She may be intersex or something, but she‚Äôs not a woman"
2531,"It‚Äôd be so much less confusing if trans people were just considered (and considered themselves) a third sex, instead of trying to claim they‚Äôve crossed over from one to the other. Sex-segregated spaces for three sexes wouldn‚Äôt leave anyone out and wouldn‚Äôt hurt anyone, and would ensure the continued sanctity of women‚Äôs spaces. Not to mention it‚Äôd just make it easier for people to talk about and wrap their minds around.

But no, they‚Äôd rather talk about feminine dicks and masculine vaginas. ü§Æ"
2532,"Like the other person on this thread said, I guess I'm confused with your use of the term bipartisan issue. It's important to make sure that we are careful who we are aligning ourselves with when we champion our causes.

I'm saying labeling someone conservative does have a place in this issue because if they are conservative, I won't be able to appeal to them from a GC perspective when I'm talking about issues relating to transgenderism.

It matters to me when someone is conservative. It matters to me in making sure that in my feminism I am not blind to the issues related to race, immigration, war and poverty."
2533,"A bipartisan issue is generally used to talk about how the Senate and House of Reps vote along party lines, not opinions of the general population. So as someone said this isn't a bipartisan issue. Literally every leftist/ liberal/ Democrat politician has come out in support of this issue. It is deep in both mainstream and not so mainstream leftist circles. In fact the left has made this about liberal and conservatives by slamming any liberal who criticizes trans ideology as being in bed with the right. They have absolutely surrended  mainstream political criticism of trans ideology to homophobic, racist, classist conservatives. So YOU as a liberal may be critical of trans ideology, but that is not reflected in leftist political circles with power, or is it reflected in their policy making. And they will have egg on their face when it backfires and seems like conservatives are on the right side of history - even if it is for the wrong reasons."
2534,Yup. This.
2535,[deleted]
2536,"Radfems shouldn't blindly support a political ideology that is often pro-porn, pro-""sex work"", and pro-self-ID just because people will accuse us of being alt-right. The Democratic Party platform is a real danger to women who already have very little agency in our current system. No woman should trust a party that chases after woke points at the expense of female prisoners who will be raped by mentally ill men."
2537,"But this is ""those damn liberals."" It is unfortunate that right-wingers are coming over here, but we cannot pretend that trans policy isn't being passed almost exclusively by liberals in the United States. It is the Democrats, not the Republicans, utterly pandering to and accepting trans ideology. Just look at Elizabeth Warren.

Perhaps the mods, who do a good job, can be one the look out for right-wingers. But I believe they already are. I am not going to not hold liberals accountable for their utter betrayal of women just because some lost right-wingers wonder over here. No matter how you talk about politics your going to attract people you don't like. It's how you deal with it, and I am not going with the falsehood that in the United States this is a bipartisan issue.

Liberals need to face the music."
2538,"No my logic is impeccable. They are men. Just saying you're a woman or thinking you're a woman doesn't change your biology. And you're patently wrong, a male athlete will always outperform a female athlete by nature of his biological advantages in the realm of sport. Men are physically stronger. It is just a true thing.  That is why women's sport is a thing. I'm talking about athletes here. Obviously any professional female athlete would beat the shit out of my fat ass because I'm not an athlete. We're talking professional sports people. 

Even if I agreed with you for arguments sake that trans women are actually women, you haven't addressed the fact that setting a precedent like this is dangerous because it opens the door to men acting in bad faith and claiming womanhood to access women's spaces."
2539,"There are so many depraved and ill people in the world. Makes it seem a given that there will be abuse if males are allowed to compete with women. Oftentimes the kind of people to be so dedicated to Olympic sports are people who desire their moment in the spotlight and their legacies. Seems obvious that some, especially with exacerbating comorbidities, would see value in sacrificing being male if it means they will be noticed both for their superior fitness ‚Äúas a woman‚Äù and be made a topic due to being a trans woman.

The stakes are high. If it‚Äôs allowed to continue I feel it is inevitable that someone is going to take it too far in competitive sport and a woman is going to end up dead.

It is **so** irresponsible to put a fully grown man and woman in a ring together and say ‚Äúdo your worst‚Äù. The power disparity, despite the attempts to discredit the truth about how HRT affects athletes, is enormous.

One way or another, it‚Äôs going to be noticed and people are going to react. The backlash is looming."
2540,I know as I was writing it I realized they stole the word. They can't steal XX though... at least I hope not.
2541,"Semenya is known to be intersex, yes. Genotyoically male with some female characteristics"
2542,Why would Semenya not be seen as a woman because she‚Äôs intersex? Not trying to be hateful I honestly am out of the loop on this.
2543,"Just speaking about the majority of conservative individuals that I know personally, but then again I don't many people who blindly follow their party  and agree with every stance."
2544,"Yeah, I feel uncomfortable calling myself ""liberal"" at all now. And no one has ever heard of radical feminism, so I don't even know how to explain what I am anymore. I loathe MRA and TRA and ""choice feminism"" and anyone who is deluded enough to think prostitution is a choice for the prostituted. Yet, no on on the right agrees with me on anything else... When I meet someone, I usually start with ""who hates Trump?!"" and then take it from there, issue by issue, to see how much common sense we have in common."
2545,"I will address that. Are you aware that more trans women are the victims of sexual assault in bathrooms than those who commit such acts when they have access to their preferred bathroom?

Also, how fo you feel about trans men having access to men's spaces? And competing in men's sports?"
2546,Well put. I think this year's Olympics will be a peak trans moment for quite a lot of the world.
2547,Doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt try!
2548,Woman = adult human female.  Semenya is an adult human but not female.  He is a male (XY chromosomes) with an intersex condition that results in him having lower than normal testosterone levels for a male but levels still far in excess of females.  This is what gives him a considerable advantage when competing against women.
2549,"That is unfortunate but it really doesn't change anything. In fact what you're saying confirms my view. You see my whole point of view pivots on the fact that men are violent and dangerous and thats why women need safe spaces. I think third spaces could be the answer but trans people in general seem to insist that they are the sex they 'identify' as and not a third category. 

Again, because men are dangerous, I think transmen are putting themselves in danger by accessing men's spaces. If I as a gay man live my life in fear of assualt from hetero guys then how much worse must it be for a transman?  

Regarding sports the fact that this hasn't emerged as a problem, transmen winning all the medals, proves my point about the advantages biological men have in sport. 

Also thank you for engaging in a civil conversation where we can explore differing points of view."
2550,"I saw a TIM get close to it recently, his ""reasoning"":

- I am a girl

- girls have female biology

- therefore I have female biology"

2557,KRAMER DOMINATING AT THE DOJO.
2558,"Wow this was a ride. When I was searching for this article I came across [a similar one posted to reddit](http://np.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/6luvs1/man_who_identifies_as_6year_old_dominates/) about a man dominating a kids crossfit class. One of the comments referred to the article saying that the man 'didn't identify' as someone who was taking growth hormones, and mentioned that this should be a standard response to a PED's accusation.

&#x200B;

I [googled PED](https://www.floelite.com/articles/6225210-emily-abbott-fails-ped-test-is-barred-from-crossfit-games) because I didn't know what it stood for: Performance-Enhancing Drug test. That article lists women who have been sanctioned for failing the test. 2nd on the list is a woman banned for using ""clomiphene - selective estrogen receptor modulator"".

&#x200B;

[Clomiphene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomifene) is primarily prescribed to treat female infertility by stimulating ovulation (for example, women with PCOS). It stimulates GnRH release, which upregulates sex hormone production and inhibits receptors for estrogen in the brain that would turn 'off' the signal. As a result, the hypothalamus perceives the body to have low estrogen, and upregulates gonadotropin (FSH and LH) production. These stimulate the ovaries to produce more estrogen. As ovary follicles develop they in turn produce more estrogen. It works for infertility because high estrogen is needed at that phase of the cycle to get a follicle to rupture for ovulation.

&#x200B;

Clomiphene is banned by the [World Anti-Doping Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_drugs_banned_by_WADA). So females can't use drugs to increase their estrogen production as a treatment for PCOS and infertility, but TiMs can pop all the estrogen that pleases them without regulation to treat their genderfeels. Women aren't allowed to mess with their natural estrogen hormone levels, not even when they have a serious medical condition... so much for ""transwomen are women""."

In a previous study, it was suggested that the experience of blood donation was also gendered, that for male donors it was ‚Äòjust a product‚Äô while for women blood donation formed a relationship with the recipient (Waldby et al. 2004).

 However, in the plasma products industry, male plasma has historically been more highly sought after and valued because it is perceived as a less ‚Äòrisky‚Äô product than plasma from women. 

Two examples demonstrate how gender operates as an organising principle in blood and plasma processing. 

First, in the UK since 2003, a policy of ‚Äòmale donor preference‚Äô has been adopted meaning that all women's plasma obtained through blood donation is usually discarded (i.e. unless there is a shortage of male plasma) because it is associated with a potentially higher incidence of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) attributed to high levels of antibodies following pregnancy. 

The reproductive potential of women's bodies impacts on how they are understood as blood and plasma donors: women are identified as potentially being or having been pregnant at the point of donation and thus at risk of adversely affecting the recipients of their donated plasma. Women are thus constructed as more risky bodies and the maternal body as representing a threat to blood and plasma product safety"

That is to say that trans people were against dating other trans people, but are fine with attempting the ‚Äúshame‚Äù card when a straight person did the same to them 

Since the only factor that changes their outlook on the situation , is the inclusion of their personal self ... it is a direct sign of narcissism.

(Another sign from this example, is that they are fine withholding the truth from the person, non-concerned with how the other person may feel about it /react to it ... why? Because they themselves deemed it moral/right/correct to do so , and their way is the right way!)

2658,"1. Sex is binary as long as you can prove me that you need 3 or more people involved to reproduce... Sex only tells the role each of us are playing in the reproductive system, and distinguish between those with male gamete and those with female gametes. 
And until proven otherwise, human species reproduce by mating a male and a female as every other mammals. That's all. But this difference implies many consequences. Intersex is not a third sex, but an umbrella term to designate people who presents some characteristics of both sex, in widely varying proportions.

2. Sexual orientation (not sexuality), tells which sex you are acttrated to: male, female or both. 

3. Society have put on us expectations and roles based on our sex, which differs depending on time and cultures, that sociologists in their studies have called gender norms. But nobody fits a 100% those expectations and roles, that's why, the entire concept of non-binary is vacuous, because of course everybody is non binary as nobody is a whole stereotype. The only thing that exists on a spectrum, is how much or how less people express masculine or feminine characteristics, which have been arbitrarily designated as such, by society. So, in reality how people express their personality in their own unique way. An entire branch of feminism, explain how those gender norms have been created and maintained by patriarchy to keep women under patriarcal oppression. I think that everybody schould read about that, and how they try to deconstruct gender norms and the consequences of male and female socialisation.

2730,6 months free of anime AND porn.
2731,"Indeed. In addition, if they are found to be using anime girls as their profile pics on social media it should equal a 12 month exclusion period, and each time they incorrectly use a Japanese word or phrase picked up from anime, another month added on. Also further buzzwords include: titty sprinkles, mouthfeel and girlcock which should attract a lifetime long exclusionary period from accessing hormones."
2732,"One of the TIMs I know just announced he's writing a light novel about ""a 30-year-old trans woman who finds out she can go to magical girl school"". It really does just confirm in my mind that half of this shit is neckbeards wanting to LARP as little girls from anime and taking it way too fucking far."
2733,good [essay ](https://outline.com/G2HZdZ) from 2017 from a formerly dysphoric guy writing about his experience with anime and how/why it fueled his desire to be a girl. Very illuminating and well informed

2736,I want to add that all trans patients (and especially the younger ones) should be required to log off Tumblr for at least a year and spend at least an hour a day outside in the real world before they can access hormones or surgery. That would cure at least 90% of them

I know their seems to be this idea that anime makes you trans but I've not read any creditable papers regarding this, if anyone can link me to some I'd really like to read them.

2745,Now THIS is a post
2746,"Now that would be an effective litmus test. I would love it if the trans community in general just stopped their fetishistic obsession with Asian bodies and cultures, and anime is *always* the gateway. At this point, you can automatically tell someone is a 30-something man with a prepubescent anime girl avatar before even looking at their profile, just by the way they talk. 

I'll never forget looking through Sailor Moon DVDs when I was 12 (and looked even younger), and this grown man with a purse came over and started talking to me in a silly girly voice about the characters. I had enough experience with creeps by then to immediately go find my friend's mom, but many similar encounters both online and in person since then just made me sick of the whole anime scene even before I realized how misogynistic most of it is."

2748,"How would you prove a negative?

I would say, they need to be in therapy for 6 months abstaining from *any* excessive internet use, with the doctor keeping a record. But then, I suspect, most of the problems will be resolved at this stage."
2749,"As far as I know, people who wanted to transition used to have to be in therapy for about two years so the doctor could make sure that they were mentally prepared for the transition. It‚Äôs so insane to me that now they don‚Äôt give a shit about that.

Many do also admit to other issues (depression, anxiety, autism ect) and it‚Äôs ridiculous to think transition medically or socially will be a magic cure all.

Personally I haven't heard of any form of therapy other than either psychotherapy (which I'm sure won't be 100% effective on someone who is dedicated to get hormones) or hormone therapy (which does more harm than good for the patient if the patient didn't experience gender dysphoria before starting it). I heard of therapy with antidepressants + neuroleptics, but it's also harmful just because of the nature of these drugs (not sure what it does in relation to dysphoria symptoms, haven't looked into it much) + I don't hear about it much, maybe it's only used in some countries."

I find some of the content harmful like loli, yaoi etc, but it‚Äôs  the pathological representation of performative gender that I find most harmful.  Mostly because performative masculinity tells one that they must be m-to-female or gay to enjoy the performative femininity.  People don‚Äôt realize they have to overcome a lifetime of conditioning to see it.  They just see themselves not fitting this (frankly ridiculous) stereotypes of western masculinity combined with (also ridiculous) eastern stereotypes if femininity and it leads potentially to them wanting to mutilate themselves."

It‚Äôs clear and proven that ‚Äútransitioning‚Äù does not work or improve outcomes for patients, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs any interest in pursuing research for other treatment options. Since being trans is highly correlated with issues like autism and cluster b personality disorders, esp narcissism, maybe an option is to somehow treat it similarly to how those conditions are managed? Most trans patients have a litany of other mental health issues, and I think in order for any treatment to be truly effective, they need to also treat all the concurrent issues as well."
2866,"And while I'll agree with it having an influence I don't believe watching anime makes one trans.  I'm of the though that during our early and teenage years we're very confused to how and who we are in the world and some of us have a very hard time fitting in.  We seek out things that help us make sense of the world and especially nowadays it's very easy to find other like minded individuals.  Problem is when we surround ourselves with like minded others it tends to make a feed back loop (echo chamber) and we start to reinforce our ideas and those ideas become facts.

I've been watching anime since I was 7 and I'm now 41 and yes as a teen I wasn't sure how I fit in the world and I even though that I might be gay.  It wasn't because I watched anime or cartoons, it was because of how much I couldn't relate to others and how much I didn't fit in the 'proper mold' of what my sex was supposed to be."

2872,"How so? They're just Japanese cartoons? Dragon Ball Z, Full Metal Alchemist, etc are honestly just cartoons with a longer plotline."
2873,"I wouldn't generalize that much. A lot of it is perfectly normal cartoons, and if you're unfamiliar with the good kind of anime I'd strongly suggest watching anything made by studio Ghibli."
2874,"There most deff is a difference.

No one should be watching loli anyways or anything similar. Yaoi, yuri are meh but can cause ""pathological"" mishaps in one form or another. 

But they fall under the umbrella term of hentai more or less. Which in turn falls under porn itself. 

Anything viewed can cause someone with mental issues to have some kind of mental break, hell there are furry fgs running around because they think they are animals.

Contrapoints got the leftish masses to accept the concept by being much cleverer about how he introduced it compared to this trans philosopher. I have to admit, I‚Äôm still shocked at how readily the ‚Äúmouthfeel‚Äù ‚Äúfeminine penis‚Äù bullshit was accepted though.

Just because a bunch of TIMs are obsessed with anime featuring girldick lolis doesn't mean that I think anime like Attack on Titan or My Hero Academia is perverted."
2907,"I studied Japanese in college because I really like Japanese Music and Sci-Fi anime.  I also really liked that they had literature (manga) aimed specifically at women.  Japanese people are very stoic, so their media and music tends to be melodramatic/full of emotion.  I come from a stoic background and we're the same way - music is really melodramatic and a socially appropriate way to release emotions.  However, I got over wanting to ever visit or live there because Japan is so hugely sexist and racist.  Women only have the right to vote because Americans wrote it into the constitution after WWII.  

To be fair - I think we used to only get the best, more analytical/sci fi Anime, and now we get all the garbage too.

*Aggretsuko* is a pretty good Anime about what it's like to be a young woman in Japan today, navigating independence and a career vs getting married with Sanrio-like characters.  The main character lets off steam by going to Karaoke and singing death metal."

""All anime"" dude, obviously she's not referring to stuff that's clearly the exception, such as Ghibli or some cherry picked examples

""Fan service"" in that context obviously meant the sexualized stuff. Yeah, lots of media has sexy scenes and such, but anime again and again has trash tropes around it. And really, most anime characters look and act like teenagers even when they're a bit older than the ""loli"" stuff..., hell, lots of stuff has characters that look and act like little girls only with boobs that will be grabbed ""for comedy"".

2923,"Female anime characters are designed specifically to either be an overtly sexualized characterization of an adult woman or an overtly infantilized child with the features of a toddler. The avatars TIM's have are either one of these, the way they feel most comfortable being perceived and feel is closest to their identity is either as a child or a mockery of being a woman. Picking a young looking anime avatar is no better than the other choice because of a lack of ""sexualized perception of the inner self"" - it implies expression of feminity is either sexual or infantile. There is clearly a connection with how anime girls are designed and portrayed and TIM's views of women, if it comes down to not wanting to use pictures of real women there are tons of other art mediums depicting women. A lot of my friends use pictures of women from live-action shows or video games, because they're characters they respect. Personally, I've always just used images I find funny or interesting looking, probably stemming from the fear of retaliation/being treated differently by announcing I'm a woman on the internet. Saying TIM's use anime pictures because of a lack of any other choices to properly express themselves is a complete bullshit argument."

I personally know someone who is obsessed with ceiling fans as a symptom of their autism, and another who spends all their time reading about WWII and memorizing facts about it. Anyone who's spent enough time around autistic people has probably heard of the fire truck joke. You can read about it here: https://www.ambitiousaboutautism.org.uk/understanding-autism/behaviour/obsessions-and-special-interests

It's an interesting hypothesis that autistic people show high levels of interest in anime beacuse of simple facial expressions but it's way more likely that autistic people just show interest in topics in a way that other people don't and since anime is extremely popular among young people it makes sense that a lot of people on the spectrum would be exposed to it as well."

2972,">A lot of the time, if you do pick something more cerebral to represent yourself, the general assumption is that you are male. You will often be addressed with male pronouns . . .

On the contrary-- If I see someone with an anime girl avatar, I assume they're a dude with a fetish."
2973,"You can ""only pick art that actually exists"" - You're saying japanese cartoons are the only art that exists? What the fuck? There are tons of artists and illustrators creating art of women as they perceive them in reality, most of them drawn by women themselves. A quick exploration of the art tag on tumblr or Twitter shows this. TIM's are ""allowed"" to do whatever they want, but there's justifiable criticism in them relating to infantile or sexualized drawings over literally anything else. There is offense in anime girls being chosen as the easiest way to identify yourself as female, it shows a serious problem in the way feminity is perceived and using it as the end all to be seen as a verifiable woman propagates that idea. Literally a jpeg of a pink heart as an avatar would be read as female by anyone. Relating to an anime girl clearly goes deeper than just wanting to be seen as a woman. Besides that, it's on the viewer/reader themselves if they perceive a gender neutral avatar as default male, being misgendered is part of being a human being in the context of non face-to-face conversation."

But you didn't read my response did you?

There is no robust, international, definition of transition - currently the gender fascists are clear that you a) need to transition medically; b ) need only take ""cross sex"" hormones, c) change your outward apparel (and if you feel the need, your hair), and d) just need to announce your pronouns.

I quickly found all the japanese blogs (or whatever personal websites were called in 1999) about their romantic and sexual relationships between these vague characters with little background.

2995,"I‚Äôm pretty sure some of those journals I linked in my previous comment talk about trans culture on the internet, like Tumblr and all, which are probably mentioned in the paper... they are just approaching it from a variety of angles. 

There are certainly some anime/trans related papers, but I don‚Äôt know any that would claim so boldly that any one thing definitely ‚Äúmakes‚Äù someone trans. This seems more like a graduate seminar topic where people might gather a great deal of related papers and read/debate them at length, drawing conclusions about each paper separately and what they might mean in relationship to one another. 

Probably papers and articles like these:

I imagine if you were to read all of the articles I just linked you‚Äôd be more informed on the topic than just about anyone else here in this subreddit or just about anywhere else."
2996,"Thought we were having a discussion but go off hun.

You also relize the op only recently added the satire tag right lol"
2997,"I fucking agree big timeee

Edit: unapologetic flair, good on you, speak the mf truth"
2998,">  I don‚Äôt know any that would claim so boldly that any one thing definitely ‚Äúmakes‚Äù someone trans. 

Neither would I, hence me asking for correlation research. I think there is a definite connection there, but I would never presume it the sole cause."
2999,"It was always obvious satire (again, didn't you see the part about the striped socks)"

3001,"This is heartbreaking. I was getting annoyed with the stylist after the first paragraph, now I just want to offer her a hug. I hope she, too, is safe.

None of these men have any right to decide what haircut anyone but themselves is getting. If they don't like what their girlfriend or whoever did with her hair, they should either live with it like the rest of us, or if they *must* and it's okay in the relationship they have, they can point out they liked the one before better or whatever, with no expectation to get a reaction beyond ""okay, but I prefer it like this"". We're not here to be pretty for men."
3002,"This is so common it hurts. In my country it's just the norm basically, it breaks my heart to listen to grown women talk about how their boyfriend/husband don't allow them (as if they were children) to cut their hair a certain way, dress a certain way and so on. It's infuriating, I always use those moments to let them know they shouldn't allow this behaviour. I have short curly hair and women my age usually tell me about how they wish they could get a similar haircut without annoying their boyfriends and my heart breaks a little bit each time, many relaxed their hair cause their boyfriend/husband don't like curly hair. You're not supposed to comment about any of it cause it's ''between them'' people say."
3003,"My dad never forgave my mom for cutting her hair. He didn't get violent about it or anything, he just held a grudge. The crazy thing is, my mom had short hair most of her life as that is her preference. She had only grown it out as an experiment for the three years before she married my dad and a few years after they were married."
3004,"When I was in high school, a girl who had always had super long, straight hair told me she'd like to get it cut but her father would be furious. Even then, immersed in my own adolescent dramas and not super-aware of other stuff, I was SO creeped out."
3005,"I had a coworker from the DR and she was saying how her daughter has beautiful curly hair. While she was brushing her daughter‚Äôs hair one morning, her husband said if she ever had the daughter‚Äôs hair cut more than 2 inches, they were going to have a problem. I couldn‚Äôt believe it because the baby was less than two and he was pressed over her hair already."
3006,That‚Äôs really scary. If my husband got like that I‚Äôd consider that a big red flag. I wouldn‚Äôt want that controllingness around my daughter growing up
3007,"Unfortunately, I have some experience with this. When a family member was going through chemotherapy, my mother wanted to shave her head in solidarity. My father threw a tantrum at the very idea. If my mother had gone through with it anyway, his behavior would have violently escalated."
3008,"Honestly don't get this infatuation with long hair, in some cultures it's common for women to cut their hair short after marriage. I've always had very short hair, never more than chin length and plenty of pixie cuts, wouldn't have lasted five minutes with any man who tried to control my hair. It's all about the fantasy to these men, think they prefer their own hand to their wives anyway."
3009,"This is horrible. 

During a hair appointment of mine, a woman in the chair next to me opened up about how she just left her abusive ex-husband and was getting a new haircut because he had never let her get it cut short and a new hairstyle was going to symbolize her new, free life. My heart broke for her."
3010,"I had a similar convo with my stylist when I brought up changing my hair radically. She laughed and said, check with your husband first. Mind you this is in a hipstery joint in Wokeville.  I was like har har har and she gently was kind of like, oh I've gotten in trouble with husbands before and went on to recount numerous instances of women coming in and redoing haircolor (always demanding that the women go lighter/stay light, or demanding that the women cover grays) and straightening hair of clients who wanted to go naturally curly but going back to straightening it because their boyfriends/husbands hated it. And men storming in when their wife's haircut was too short and demanding they refund him rather than the woman who paid for the haircut!

She said she had one client whose husband accompanied her on her appointments and told the stylist how to cut this woman's hair, and how blond it should be. I assumed this was some trophy wife situation and she was like um no this woman is in her 60s and her husband wants her to maintain the same color she's had for like 40 years.

You know that whole Keanu girlfriend thing? It's like that. What we do with our hair is so scrutinized, we spend $$$ on it and can't take it lightly because of the reaction we get. It can range from mockery to job loss to violence. Women are drowning in privilege over here."
3011,"I have heard of stylists in the U.S. going through formal training to spot and help domestic violence victims. The idea seems to be that the hairstylist and the GYN are places where even the most controlling men may not accompany their wife/girlfriend. I‚Äôve even spotted a ‚Äúwe can get you to safety‚Äù type sign in the ladies room at my salon similar to the signs you see in bar restrooms.

Edit: a word"
3012,"Even at the age of 37 I can be shocked at men‚Äôs capacity for cruelty and control. 

I had genuinely never had this issue and never considered it an issue."
3013,"I remember when I was a teenager and attended a drawing course after school. I was sitting next to an instructor and the guy who owned the school. They were chatting while all students were sketching, and made no effort not to be overheard. The owner said that his wife had cut her hair recently, that he really hated it, and that her ""dumb b**ch of a friend"" made her do it. He would keep making comments about it for about a month, and when he wasn‚Äôt talking about his wife, he‚Äôd talk about women‚Äôs hair in general. 

Things like this make me hate my long hair.

Not that long hair makes things okay. Then it‚Äôs the wrong color, then it‚Äôs ""why do you have your hair up in a bun"" (in fucking July), then it‚Äôs ""why did you trim your hair so that it‚Äôs only shoulder length"". All said by women."
3014,"That seems to be widespread, actually. A few years ago, I went to get my hair cut - I brought a photo of Pink and said that's what I want. The hairdresser initially refused to cut my hair that short, and actually asked me for a written note from my husband approving of the haircut. I stood my ground and got the haircut, but it was shocking how reluctant she was to cut my hair so short. She must have seen stuff that made her wary..."
3015,"This is an issue a lot of black women have faced. Not necessarily for a haircut but around hair texture. When going natural, that is, not chemically straightening your hair started to become popular again in the late 90s I had MANY conversations with black women whose husbands/partners threatened to leave them. Thankfully, no one I talked to expected violence, but the fear kept many women from going natural. If you search around the MANY anti-black woman memes online probably half relate to hair. The anti-weave meme is a standard."
3016,Oh my gosh. How sad. I too was annoyed with the hairstylist at first but I now understand her concern. How heartbreaking. Can I ask generally what part of the country/world you are located in?
3017,"I work in domestic violence/woman abuse and I read this a little differently. It seems to me that the stylist may be living with an abuser or her partner/father etc is abusive. It was the whispering that did it for me. A woman who has not experienced abuse and has heard some stories about ridiculous and threatening misogynistic abusers storming into the salons of friends would not necessarily give a toss and call security or cops right away to have him removed.  I am thinking that the stylist herself is living with it or has in the past. If she is, there is 24/7 help to move away from a controlling abuser. 
I have been doing the work for years now and years of hearing stories about these #$&holes has caused me to tell everyone I meet the three golden truths about woman abuse.  A male abuser is ALWAYS misogynistic in his thinking, abuse is ALWAYS deliberate and used to maintain control and abusers will ALWAYS play the victim and try to get his partner to feel complicit in the abuse."
3018,"It enrages me, too. 
Domestic abuse is horrifying. I got bangs cut when my spouse couldn't come with me to the hair appointment, and was so angry. Apparently i should have consulted first. But I wanted bangs. This was 4 years ago. I later found out from my hair dresser that my spouse went  to my hair dresser, stormed up to him and told me he could never cut my hair again, along with many profanities. 

It was common for me to be told to put on makeup and do my hair in specific ways before I could leave the house with them, or if we had social plans. Even just going to the gas station I had to look 'hot'. Heavy makeup, straightened hair, and I learned it was best if my clothes were not showing too much skin but if they were tight, always had  to be approved or denied.
It was all about control and appearance. Cutting my hair without permission was treated like a massive betrayal.
But in the same way, when out with my spouses friends, if I was told to kiss Lester or show them a body part of mine, I had to comply. One time we were drinking and my spouse told J to let me touch his dick so I could see how small it was. I thought they were joking, until my spouse starting getting angry that I hadn't come over to them. When I did they whispered that J had no sex for years and it would be really nice of me to touch him, that he had a crush on me, he was depressed and it would make him so happy. My spouse took my hand and I was shaking and stuck it in his pants. I started crying and J was going yes yes thank you thank and my spouse was moving my hand, kept pinching me and saying come on be nice! 
My body was their property to them, but they liked to 'show' me off and to 'show' their friends my body and what it was like being with me.  They felt good when their friends complimented me to my spouse, sexually. after having to touch J's penis I was angry, but when I tried to tell them while we were going to bed they pulled me out of bed by my hair and said I had to listen to them.
We are not together anymore. Not divorced yet, but separated.
It's all about control, possession."
3019,"Stylists ask me if I'm sure 300 times beforehand, every time, since I started cutting it above the shoulders at 13, but never mention boyfriends. Never before I thought that this much dudes are still That much in 19 century mentally and will start raging because someone dared to change his property's looks Not The Way He Approves. But thinking about it now, I totally should've known better tbh."
3020,"I‚Äôve had the same thing happen to me (in the southern US) multiple times. Even for a two inch trim! And every time, at every salon, they give the same response, that they‚Äôve all had men come in angry over their wife‚Äôs/girlfriend‚Äôs hair cut. It‚Äôs genuinely insane to me how far reaching men‚Äôs control is on women‚Äôs lives."
3021,"Remember that father that SHAVED his daughters hair and videotaped it while she cried bc she got it highlighted?

That's why I hate the ""bro that is someones mother, daughter, sister"" argument. Women are humans! We are not extentions of some man you fucking narcissists."
3022,"I had stringy, wavy, oily hair when I was 15 and had it cut off in 1956 when we were all getting ducktails (the Elvis Presley influence, of course).  Yes, we suffered from social contagion, also--it was the ""rebel"" era.  Rebels without a clue, for the most part, although I pretended to be a ""beatnik"" for about a week.  It seemed regressive.

My dad told me I had ""ruined"" my hair.  It was a relief to get it cut and I kept it short for a long time, never letting it get below collar length."
3023,"You've got me thinking about my experience when I got my hair cut. I got about 3ft of hair chooped off over the summer and the hairdressers must have asked me about 20 times if I was sure and had I asked my boyfriend. Then they seemed to be worried that my boyfriend had made me.

I fancied a drastic change and I just thought they were worried i'd sue or something? Maybe they have had crazy partners turn up at the salon before."
3024,"I had a male haircutter argue with me over 6 inches. I get my hair cut twice a year because I'm lazy and cheap and summer was coming, so why not cut off alot? My husband doesn't really notice but I guess that means I didn't marry a psycho?"
3025,"That's horrible! At first I was a little annoyed with your hair stylist but I can see how she would be afraid for the consequences!

I recently cut my hair really short. The hair stylist asked me this question as well. I kind of laughed it off and she then told me how her boyfriend wouldnt let her cut her hair shorter, even though she always wanted to try it out. He actually told her he would consider breaking up with her if she went shorter than shoulder length. I would've laughed in his face if my boyfriend said something like that, but she kind of accepted it as a part of being a woman in a relationship. It ridiculous."
3026,"I have demon hair.  It's fine, there's lots of it, it's not quite curly, not quite straight and I have a double crown.  Basically I look like I've stuck my finger in a light socket and have barely escaped a vicious attack by birds on a daily basis.

Since I've been married I've grown it long, dyed it blue, purple, fire engine ref and some more natural colours and even completely shaved my head.

Every time I do something drastic to it, the stylist (I'm cheap so I just go to Super Cuts or whatever) 99% of the time asks me if it's okay with my husband.

I never really thought anything of it (he doesn't care what I do to my hair unless he's the one trying to get it untangled from a zipper without scalping me) until one day I was in the chair having a perm (no, it did not turn out well) and the woman next to me was having high lights.  Her husband came in, I assume to pick her up or something and saw that she was getting highlights done.  He went off on her, called her a whore and threatened to leave her.  She was crying and had the stylist take the tin foil things out and wash it out asap.  When they left (he was still yelling at her) we all looked at each other like ""WTAF just happened?"" and my stylist said to me, ""you know, that's not the first time that's happened here.  Men."" (when she said ""men"" she raised her eyebrow and nodded to me as if the subtext was ""are fucking morons"")

I wish I'd had the guts to say something to him.  If it happened today I definitely would have but I was a pathetic loser in my younger days and just kept quiet. :("
3027,Men and their love for ‚Äúlong hair‚Äù is so bizarre to me. It‚Äôs like certain things about a woman‚Äôs appearance have to be sexualized. Why is long hair more feminine than shorter hair?
3028,"Anytime I go to get my haircut - since elementary school - it's to chop it all off and go very, very short. I've never had a hair cut like this without the stylist going ""are you sure? are you *sure*, you're sure?   Ôºº(¬∫ ‚ñ° ¬∫ l|l)/ ""

I used to think it was because they were afraid I'd get upset and complain if I didn't like it since it is so extreme a change. It never occurred to me that it might be for something like this. I shudder."
3029,Holy shit.  This is shocking and terrible.
3030,"This post makes me sick. I consider myself a feminist but this isn't even something I'd thought of. Who could ever think of such a thing? Women have to be so careful all the time but sometimes we still slip up. Who could anticipate such violence over something so stupid? I should know better, and I'm both glad your stylist asked and so angry that she had to. I'm finally reading Handmaid's Tale and women's lack of bodily autonomy seems like such a fictional concept, but you just gave me whiplash. It's real. I hate men."
3031,"I grow my hair out so I can donate it when it gets long enough.

Once, an old man who was getting his hair cut next to me started crying because he saw me getting all my hair cut off. He was gesticulating wildly and saying things like ‚ÄúOh, no why would you ever do a thing like that? What a waste.‚Äù 

No, it‚Äôs not a waste. I‚Äôm donating it. I had no idea who this guy was. Some men feel such creepy ownership over random women‚Äôs hair."
3032,[removed]
3033,"Wow.  I never thought about all that from that perspective.  Thanks for sharing this story.

> I‚Äôm so sick of living in a world with violent men. 

Me too, sister.  Me too."
3034,"We had a couple in my class in highschool. Both of them had really long wavy and thick hair.  We‚Äôre talking waist length both of them! They really bonded over their similar hair. 

The boy looked a bit like he belonged in an 80‚Äôs metal/rockband (this was before manbuns were a thing).  Vagabond style. 
The girl took a lot better care of her hair but it still looked a bit like two huge curtains of thick curly hair hiding her face. 

One day she, spur if the moment, got it cut to a much cuter above the shoulder cut. More than half of her hairlength gone. 
I will admit she was nearly unrecognizable but nothing else changed right? Still a funny cute girl, only difference is he could actually look her in the eye now without the hair curtain. They‚Äôll be fine right?

Wrong. 

BF broke up with her immediately. 
Guess that shows how much she was worth to him..."
3035,"I did work in that industry, this is definitely a thing unfortunately."
3036,"In parts of Australia, there is free, specialised training available to hairdressers to help them to spot the signs of domestic violence and assist their clients. It's called HaiR-3R‚Äôs and many stylists have received the training."
3037,"This happened to me when i got a buzz cut. My father looked at me with disgust...as if his opinion matters. I'm so tired of it, honestly"
3038,"This post is pertinent! I just got my hair cut to collarbone length and I've never had it this short before. My mother never let me cut my har growing up. I was honestly scared she would hurt me (she was abusive). But for her, she said long hair looks better on both women AND men so idk how rooted in misogyny her long hair obsession was. 

Still, I feel so happy now that I cut my hair! It's liberating and if men don't like it they can fuck off.  It's horrible reading about women who can't cut their hair because of men in their lives...like holy shit, women are not free if they need PERMISSION for a haircut!

 I'm curious to see people's reactions when I go into work tomorrow...I'm sure I'll be told I ""looked better before"" and I can't wait to tell people I don't care lol. Maybe I'll even buzz it off.

Woman =/= long hair."
3039,"I had no idea that this was so common for hairstylists to know about or experience. But why would I continue to even be remotely surprised? 
While I've never felt threatened due to my hair I have had men tell me unprompted what hairstyle they preferred on me even as I'd just returned from a salon visit obviously wearing the style *I preferred.
Having long flowing hair is so sought after that I've been told it can save an otherwise unattractive woman from being totally repulsive."
3040,"A friend of mine who is a stylist told me that her cosmetology school added a course on domestic violence as a requirement for graduation.They learn the signs that a woman might be unsafe and how to talk to them about it, what steps to take. Sad that it's needed, but glad it's being taught.

I remember when my marriage started getting really abusive my mom paid for me to get my hair done while I was visiting her out of state to lift my spirits. In the hours I spent in the chair I told this young stylist everything- all my secrets, the raw and honest truth about how brutal he had been, things I normally downplayed or hid from my family, friends, even my psychiatrist. I was planning on leaving him and asking the state's attorney to prosecute him for the domestic battery charge he had been arrested for and I just needed to say it out loud, and she just let me spill it all without any shame or judgement. 

I saw her a year later, and told her I was back with him, he had changed, he was wonderful to me again like he was in the beginning blah blah blah. She looked anguished and said ""I can't tell you what to do, but I don't want the next time I do your hair to be for your funeral"" Those words stuck with me, I never forgot them, or the compassion she showed me that day.

I finally left him for good in July. Having a hearing for the plenary order of protection right before Christmas, which I'm confident I'll win, and then I have my appointment with her scheduled for December 28th. I'm really looking forward to updating her on everything."
3041,My ex hated my shoulder-length pink hair and begged me to go back to blond. It was one of the reasons we ended. Now I have a lovely girlfriend who loves my pink hair.
3042,"This made me cry.

It also made me want to cut off a foot of my hair."
3043,"Hairstylists are amazing. They aren't just hair-cutters, they do so much and look out for people. It's really wonderful."
3044,"*what the fuck*

I'm tempted to get a pixie cut just to piss off men. My little rebellion."
3045,Wow. I had a very controlling ex boyfriend who started screaming at me for trimming my hair. He claimed to be a feminist too.
3046,"That‚Äôs awful. :( I can‚Äôt believe I used to wish I were heterosexual. Just because the dating pool is larger if you‚Äôre straight...but quality over quantity mannn.

Anyway, I remember the hair stylist asking me a ton when I was a teenager if I was positive I wanted all my hair chopped off. I kept reassuring her. Of all people, my mom got angry with me. She said I looked like I was a boy and called me ugly and was so enraged,. She didn‚Äôt threaten to kill anyone, but I remember distinctly my excitement of the haircut going from feeing free to getting sick that night/the next day. I literally was throwing up over HAIR. 

I don‚Äôt understand why our hair matters so much to people. I know my mom loves me and probably has no idea how much that hurt (maybe doesn‚Äôt even remember flipping out...she was abused as a kid), but it definitely left a scar on me mentally. It probably played a role in my transition too. Everything I loved being ‚Äúbad‚Äù because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfor girls.‚Äù

My sexuality, my interests, my style, everything about me felt ‚Äúwrong‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt have the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù genitals for them. Fuck that."
3047,[deleted]
3048,"One time I went in to have the sides of my head shaved, and my hairstylist said her father would kill her if she ever did that to her own hair. This was a grown adult woman!"
3049,"That's horrifying. This explains the time I went from shoulder length hair to a pixie cut and the stylist asked me multiple times if I was sure about it and if my boyfriend would be angry. I thought she was joking, or just worried that maybe I would miss the length. It didn't cross my mind that this happens."
3050,Reading the post and comments it‚Äôs shocking that this is so common that stylists are literally afraid of clients‚Äô angry husbands. So sad. Those men are fucking pieces of shit.
3051,"Is this the US, OP?"
3052,"Oh, men own their hair? Wtf?"
3053,"I managed to go through chemo without losing my hair ( for now )  , this posts makes me kind of want to shave it off anyway, performing femininity with hair is exhausting."
3054,As a very independent introverted (and probably autistic) single lesbian with a good relationship with her father this is something that has literally never occurred to me as something I would need to worry about. This is going to be on my mind the whole time I‚Äôm at the stylist next week ._.
3055,"I was a hairstylist for a decade and I cannot begin the enumerate the times that I would tell a client that a new short haircut would suit their face, be easier to style, would be fun and chic or would be told ""I would love a short haircut but my husband would kill me"". 

This didn't just apply to short hair but also to blonde hair color. I once had a client who had highlights that really didn't suit her and we kept talking about doing something darker that would look healthier and be easier to maintain. We did a pretty light brown that was no where near raven black and her husband called me at the salon to cuss me out and threaten me. He said that I was a ""fucking bitch"" who wanted to make his wife ugly ""because you fucking feminists can't leave it alone.""

I saw women bleaching their already fried ends to smithereens to keep their husbands happy. And then the husband would come in and I would meet him-- I was aghast! These men were always pudgy, dough-y and bald. I hate that women get trapped by the expectations of these men and it is enraging."
3056,Males are a disease.
3057,"> I can‚Äôt imagine a barber asking a male customer what his girlfriend thinks of him getting his hair cut.

I went with my ex to get his hair cut before and the barber asked me if I was ok with it! So it does happen"
3058,I find longer hair on men extremely attractive. I get a little sad whenever my boyfriend gets a haircut. Still wouldn't even think to hurt him or tell him not to.
3059,"There is a trailer video for a game called Apex Legends on YouTube. One of the characters in the game - Wraith - has a valuable cosmetic costume you can buy or potentially earn from playing alot. In this trailer video it went over her back store of how she became bald and men in the comments said that now they finally respect the bald Wraith costume and that comment has 5,900 likes. https://youtu.be/yU_eip8IvQU for those curious.

I keep thinking of all the media that's like, ""And all the men died."" and smiling."
3060,"It's so sad... for such a trivial thing which should be all her own choice, her body.

It reminds me of a video I saw on Facebook, where a woman was stuck with her abusive partner and she had to trick the man to let her (accompanied by him) let her pet go to the vet. There she very stealthily slipped a written note to the desk staff to get help and warn that her partner has a gun, because that was her one and only chance to escape this abusive relationship, due to being kept locked up inside by him any other time. I am glad how the staff there handled it, and he was arrested by police.

But the sad thing is that this seems to be one of the few ways women have been able to find safety from such abuse where they are treated as hostages. It is not unlike the cases of serial killers abducting little girls and the girls' only way to escape would be things like tricking the man into friendship (that I won't be surprised if it involves enduring rape) til she can find opportunity to escape or get help, or distracting the man somehow to give her a chance to escape. The fact that this is as common as it is (and probably more than we hear cause of all the unsolved cases of abductions), while the other way around of boys being violently abducted by female serial killers is pretty much unheard of, it is really scary to be female."
3061,"When my ex broke up with me I cut my own hair one night, and went to get it properly cut the next day.

Everyone said I looked so cute and it really helped my self esteem during that time"
3062,I keep my hair short (above my shoulders pretty much all the time) and I CONSTANTLY am asked what my male partner thinks of my hair. It's so weird. I never know what to say. He doesn't care?? He doesn't get an opinion?? It's MY hair?? it's bizzare.
3063,Reading a thread like this really drives home why so many women hate men. FFS this is insane. We men really have no idea.
3064,"Wow, this is interesting. Up till 40 y.o. I'd always had long hair to about between distal scapula and waist. Most of the time would wear it in 1 or two braids, or up sometimes at work. I liked it because it was simple and I didn't have to get it cut or trimmed. Just wash it every so often. No fussing required, so very low maintenance. I recall one man telling me ""don't you find men think your long hair is sexy?"" and I said WTF? Huh? I suppose I was clueless about mainstream culture

Long hair is heavy, though, and mine was thick so especially heavy. I got it cut after 40 to about chin length, because I was tired of having so many HAs from wearing my hair up a lot. My husband was ""whatever you want"" when I told him I was thinking of cutting it, not that I would have paid him much attention about that -- it's MY hair! 

Frankly I find short hair is far more work than long hair. Short hair has to be trimmed/cut frequently, and has to be brushed/styled just so. My hair's thinned with age but still has a lot of (I guess it's called) volume, and looks weird to me. . With my long hair I just braided it back or knotted it up. Maybe trim the ends every six months. It didn't floof out several inches because there was enough weight to hold it down.

So I'm growing my hair longer again. Besides, long hair in a braid is common in many non-first-world cultures regardless of age. It's simple and straightforward."
3065,"Its amazing to me that, even though I've been well aware about this weird sick need to control women's hair length so many men have for a long time now, it still always shocks me every time I read about it, or hear about it or talk to another woman who is with someone like that."

3067,¬øWhere do you live? ¬øEgypt?
3068,Stay safe but women dont have to go the extra mile to stay safe compared to men. 70 percent of all violent crimes are committed against men not woman. Im not saying women dont have terrible things happen but this post does put men in a generalisation that shouldn't exist. I see it as anyone (man or woman) that rapes or commits terrible crimes to that magnitude shouldn't really be considered a person until they change who they are.
3069,That's awful.  Thank you for sharing. I hope she's not dating one of those dudes :/
3070,"Did you ask her how her partner feels about her having a job? Might have got the point across! 

I died my hair green once. My nephews father smirked and said something along the lines of ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm surprised your husband let you do that‚Äù. I was sort of nasty in tone but I just said something like ‚Äúwhy would husband hAve control over what I do with my hair?‚Äù. Thanksgiving last year was sort of awkward for a moment! But we all laughed it off to stay calm. But seriously? Fuck  right off.

Edit: personal anecdote aside, I feel for women who consider this normal. It‚Äôs not normal. You should be loved for who you are, not for who you are willing to be for a person."
3071,"Related story but opposite, when the barber who knows my family (is family friend), my husband went to shave his long beard at his salon and he made him call me ask me in front of him on speaker, it was funny no bad intention. I said yes why not. 

But your situation sounds more like stylest was judgmental, sorry to hear"
3072,[removed]
3073,"It is heartbreaking. I've (fortunately) never had an incident as scary as what those stylists went through - but if I had a dollar for every time I've heard ""I wish I could go short but my husband/boyfriend/dad won't *let* me, I could retire. It kills me because I desperately want to tell them to tell those dudes to worry about their own damn hair and grow theirs long if they like it so much, but they didn't ask me and I don't want to make them uncomfortable and I know not all of them are safe to do so. However if I get the inkling that they are not totally signed on to this ""man controls my hair"" situation, I definitely try to throw in some subtle encouragement in hopes that they'll get the courage/strength to make their own decisions."
3074,">This is heartbreaking. I was getting annoyed with the stylist after the first paragraph, now I just want to offer her a hug. I hope she, too, is safe.

Same.

I saw an ad campaign once at the salon (the lady working with my hair had left a flyer out) about how you can tell your stylist if you're being abused at home and they'll report it for you so you don't have to risk calling from your own home."
3075,"Men are so mentally deficient.  They see everything that has to do with looks as ‚Äúfemale‚Äù by default.  

If they are so worried about appearances then they need to worry about their own appearance first."

3077,[deleted]
3078,"Oh hell yes--that ""allow"" bullshit really sets off my anger.  It's our hair--fix it how you like it, don't cater to these assholes who are here today, gone tomorrow, and only value you for what you can do for them."
3079,Wow. How freaking shitty of him.
3080,Fathers who are so invested in their daughters‚Äô appearance are the creepiest creepers who ever creeped. I could get a buzz cut and dye my hair purple and my dad probably wouldn‚Äôt even notice or comment.
3081,"It seems like the only reason he would care about the length of a baby‚Äôs hair is to feminize it, aka to sexualize it"
3082,I'm from the DR. The amount of money regular women expend on their hair alone is insane. Women not cutting their hair a certain way for fear of their husband's reaction is not just common but basically the norm. When a married woman does some change to her appearence the first fucking question is ''does your husband approves?'' or any other variant. It fucking sucks.
3083,"Long curly hair is definitely a burden for a small girl. They get stickies in it and to properly brush it, it needs to be shampooed. That bath every night + brushing = at least 30 minutes of being made to sit still. That's not really an age appropriate expectation of a toddler. And it can't be rushed because if you hurt them with the brush they won't want to sit still at all."
3084,"Goodness I hope you mom left your dad, thats scary abusive behavior. No one should live in fear over something so small as a hair cut."
3085,"> in some cultures it's common for women to cut their hair short after marriage.

This is also usually caused by men being controlling though. Some men expect their wives to keep their hair short hoping that other men won‚Äôt find them attractive."
3086,I have a number 4 cut and the amount of people that tell me I look like a man (male and female) is insane. What the actual fuck. It's just hair!!
3087,I would have asked her if I could buy her some drinks.
3088,">You know that whole Keanu girlfriend thing? It's like that. 

Alexandra's hair is gorgeous and I will fight people."
3089,"What‚Äôs with males obsession with blonde hair? I have naturally blonde hair, but wear it brunette to avoid the attention. The blonder I go, the more male attention I get. ALWAYS."
3090,">And men storming in when their wife's haircut was too short and demanding they refund him rather than the woman who paid for the haircut!

This is the only bit I have a second idea on.  I know loads of people who wouldn't complain if instead of a trim the hairdresser gave them a no1.  And their partner gets sick of listening and goes and complains them self."
3091,"Yeah, I've heard about that too.

In communities where women get their hair done frequently it's often the sole refuge for women as its the one place their husbands/fathers will never go."

3093,"Maybe that's the thing behind long hair, that stupid 70s fantasy of the bun coming down and the glasses coming off for some guy only. Sarah Palin played that fantasy to men very well."
3094,"That sounds insane.. a written permission note from your husband? If you don't mind me asking what country and was the stylist male or female? Just curious, feel free not to answer if it makes you uncomfortable."
3095,WHAT.
3096,I would have given my business to someone else.
3097,"I work with a women of middle Eastern background and one day she came in and said that she was going to start straightening her hair again, because her BUTCHER had commented on the fact she wasn't doing it. I was like, 'wtf, dude, what business is it of his?' but she is now doing it on a daily basis..."
3098,">If you search around the MANY anti-black woman memes online probably half relate to hair.

\[Seething internally\]"
3099,"There's a post on r/unexpected of a girl with massive natural hair taking it out of a bun.  Goddamn those comments are fucking depressing.   Either calling it sexy and gorgeous or unmaintened and ugly with a few ""but she obviously keeps it clean"" in there.  *That* blew my mind.  I guess I live on a bubble because I seriously didnt realize there are people who perceive natural hair as unclean."
3100,This makes me so sad. :(
3101,"I‚Äôm Irish, but the stylist wasn‚Äôt. She sounded Eastern European, maybe Polish?"
3102,That is horrific and I'm sorry he put you through that.
3103,[removed]
3104,"Oooh, I remember that one. And then a bunch of men were saying nasty things about the girl like ""I guess she's one of the stupid ones who doesn't realize it grows back"" or that the mother had basically cut the father's penis off (their words, not mine) by letting the daughter get highlights without his permission. Wtf why are men so crazy and violent? They have this weird obsession with hair in particular and genuinely seem to think that they own their wives' and daughters' hair."
3105,Haha but proper ladies in the 50s had short hair too! That's crazy.
3106,"Ughh, good to know not all men are like crazy about the hair...."
3107,I have a rule that any time a man gives me an ultimatum (it‚Äôs me or your career/ dogs/ hobby/ haircut/ fill in the blanks) I pick the other and tell him to pack his bags. Not because I necessarily think my appearance is more important than a relationship but because the right person won‚Äôt make me choose or attempt to control or manipulate me. But I know not all women are in my position. I just wish I‚Äôd learned this years ago!
3108,"Don't blame yourself for not wanting to take on an angry male.

Every video of a TIM flipping out has like 20 women standing there totally meek.

You're not alone."
3109,"Because long hair is easier for them to grab, like a leash, so they can control where we move during an altercation."
3110,"The evopsych answer is that long healthy hair is a sign of health/youth/fertility. I‚Äôm sure it has roots in that, but it‚Äôs definitely become a signifier of femininity in itself. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if men felt like their wife/gf getting a short haircut was reducing her femininity, and thus making him less manly in comparison. It‚Äôs some weird reverse-Samson shit."
3111,"That's awesome, wish we had that here"
3112,Ew what a gross old fuck
3113,"Oh wow. Sometimes true friends have to tell you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear. She sounds amazing and I‚Äôm glad you managed to get away from him."
3114,"I'm glad to hear your away from him, abusers are great at ""Pretending"" to change to hook you back. But they never change, EVER. And to often it ends in tragedy. Domestic Violence is horrible."
3115,Should be an ex boyfriend.
3116,"No, Ireland!"
3117,"See also men who say their wives won't let them have a beard or moustache. Difference being we're not likely to beat them up for not shaving, though it might have happened."
3118,"You have no idea?  What if, I don't know...what if you started **FUCKING LISTENING** every one of the thousands of times a woman has mentioned how and why she doesn't feel safe?  Unless you're a seven year old, you've heard these kinds of stories before.  So how is it possible that you're still surprised?"
3119,"Men do know how awful men are to women. That‚Äôs why the overprotective dad who doesn‚Äôt want his daughter to have a boyfriend until she‚Äôs 40 stereotype is so prevalent. I‚Äôm sorry, but men don‚Äôt get to play dumb about their shitiness."
3120,Nobody asked
3121,Did you even read the whole post before commenting? She was asking because she was concerned for my safety.
3122,She wasn‚Äôt being judgmental. She was concerned for my safety. Read the full post.
3123,"Is there any evidence that this is a copy? The experience is common among women so even if there is a similar story I wouldn‚Äôt think a copy. Also, OP has posted multiple times on this sub before while you don‚Äôt have any post history."
3124,"My aunt cut her hair off into a short boyish haircut in the week after her father died. In his lifetime she wore her long hair to her hips.
He molested her and all of her sisters, one of whom was my mother."
3125,"There was a report on the local news tonight actually about how there is a program being set up to teach trainee hairdressers to respond to domestic abuse among their clients. A great initiative, but also sad to be necessary"
3126,Femininity performance...longer hair is also seen as a youthful thing and you know how they love preying on girls. Or getting hard at the fantasy of it.
3127,My stepfather wanted my hair long and he sexually abused me since toddlerhood. I cut it off at 7 and he was furious. I wore it short until 10 because my body became round and I could be seen as female again anyway.
3128,"I also cut off all my hair quite often (as I have a hair loss condition). I don‚Äôt do it to be edgy, or make a statement or look GNC. I do it for my mental health. 
Most comments I get are along the lines of how do you expect to get a man? Or who will find a bald woman attractive. To which I reply, if someone doesn‚Äôt want to be with me because of my hair, then there are about 0 reasons I would want to be with them. 

Also, once you get over the fear of going short and actually doing it, it‚Äôs quite liberating and your ‚Äòcrowning glory‚Äô isn‚Äôt all that important."
3129,"I've heard it stated that long hair is ""fuck me"" hair, and after a point, a woman has a revelation...then she chops it all off into ""fuck you"" hair. I like thinking of it that way."
3130,But I doubt the father is going to actually take time everyday to take care of the daughters hair.
3131,"Creep on creepin on, creepy dad. creep it real"
3132,"Exactly. And when I got my shoulder-length hair cut  at 18 and my boyfriend was upset, I made it clear that it was none of his damn business."
3133,It def felt that way. My coworker was like what if she has spilt ends or what if she wants it short. He wasn‚Äôt trying to hear any part of that. She said that he got so angry he turned red. Mind you the baby is less than two...like wow
3134,"And no wonder we have had so many women pretend their men in order to remain single when women were forced into marriages. Being a woman is constant, never ending subjugation and fearing for your life."
3135,"Fascinating to consider. People talk all the time about how boys are just naturally more rambunctious, can't sit still at school, etc. If asked parents assure that they're treating their kids just the same and it's just ""how it is"".

But how easy would it be to overlook grooming and how long hair requires these constant lessons in self-discipline. From a young age, little girls are being asked to sit still, be quiet, and accept a rather large degree of pain. I remember being a little girl and it HURT to have my hair brushed. Badly. At least from my little girl perspective. 

I can't imagine that kind of training from a young age doesn't leave a mark."
3136,She never did. She was an expert at excusing his behavior.
3137,"Sure, but a lot of it is just because long hair isn't as easily managed with work, home, children, amazed at how some women have so much time for their hair !"
3138,I've seen women who look incredibly beautiful with short hair but get so much negativity they grow it out and never cut it again. Even today so many who really need to cut their old tired hair off at this point.
3139,"Men like that are often cavemen. The more, and the brighter, the better. LONNGGGG HAIR. SUPER BRIGHT BLONDE. Of course long blonde hair can be gorgeous! But thinking that‚Äôs the pinnacle of beauty just shows that they‚Äôre bad at fashion and aesthetics."
3140,"Interesting. As I've been scrolling down I've been puzzled by all the comments about men wanting women's hair to be long and I'm like, I have a pixie cut and I get plenty of male attention and I'm in my damned 40s. Well it's pale blonde so maybe that's it."
3141,"Not related, but I need to complain!

Long hair goes up for sex not get taken down! Takes so freaking long to get those knots out when I just want to sleep. (Mumble mumble) stupid males and their stupid-- 

right right, we are just for males' amusement. I know. (/s)"
3142,It's a country in the Western Europe. The hairdresser was a woman in her 40s.
3143,Ooh..sounds like you haven‚Äôt listened to Onision‚Äôs video about black hair care tips. My eyes are still in the back of my skull from listening to that PoS.
3144,Oh yeah. I had locs for about five years. The comments about them were unreal. Just annoying AF.
3145,Her hair is AMAZING.
3146,That makes sense from what I've heard of Eastern European men.
3147,"Likewise, and I'm glad you're out. Stay safe!"
3148,"My grandmother thought long hair was childish. She berated all her grown daughters if their hair got longer than their collars. Called it ridiculous for a grown woman to have long hair. Of course she was of the generation that went to the salon for a ""set"" and wore kerchiefs to bed to ptotect the curls."
3149,"But they all had permanents so it could be curly.  Curls, for some reason, were beloved and sought, even if short.  Audrey Hepburn made an impression with her ""pixie"" cut as well. 

I had boys--it was off to the barber for a buzz cut and they loved it, although they started growing long hair when they were teens in the 70s.  I just can't see myself spending hours doing long hair for a couple of  pre-K girls.  They would have had short hair also and taught how to manage it themselves.  I knew women who spent loads of money on hairdressers, but a good cut was all I asked for--and sometimes it was very hard to get."
3150,"Too many girls and women actually think that ""he won't love me"" if I don't do exactly what he says and wants.  It really is pathetic that they are taught that.  It's up to us to spread the word that they should please themselves, not *him* or anyone else but oneself, unless you are doing someone a favor or service.  But just to gain approval from someone who thinks they can control you?  No, because they will never stop increasing what they want, along with  other means of controlling you to get it.

I like doing what I think is good for me and is right for me; I always have.  My biggest mistakes in life were trying to gain approval from some man, even if I thought it would benefit me."
3151,"Yup. Men love using evopsych to rationalize why they like ""fertile"" women aka girls who have no body hair but long hair on their heads. So ridiculous. Men are gross."
3152,"The Freudian version is that it replaces our frighteningly missing penises in their minds and reassures them that we won't cut their dicks off.

Yes that's totally a good and believable theory there Sigmund."
3153,So what's the bullshit explanation for why men usually have shorter hair now but had long hair in the past?
3154,"Jesus, that's even worse, the oppression gets a shade of religion too, isn't it? There are many, MANY men like this in Hungary too and we are even more behind in women's rights than the West. But I'd still say that many other men don't give a single f about their girlfriend's/wife's/etc hair. Although my own father would be disgusted probably and he would say that I'm a lesbian(yes, it's a slur here, along with gay/faggot because these are supposed to be ""baaaad"" things), if I'd cut my hair short but I wouldn't care, he doesn't own me(never understood his logic, he has this extreme stance on other topics too). But my BF would be chill with it, we've talked about it. He would be sad for a short while but it would be completely okay.(He's strongly balding and he likes to run his fingers through my hair for some happy feelings :D)"
3155,Agreed!! I will admit that with my ex I preferred his hair longer and made my preference known. I also took his opinion into consideration with my hair and sent him photos when I'd done things. I think in relationships there is a bit of give and take
3156,"Yeah. I meant ""we men collectively"" have no idea. Not me personally. I thought that was sort of obvious."
3157,[removed]
3158,"You know who else doesn't get to play dumb about being terrible? Literally anybody. Be it guy or girl anyone can be a real piece of work and their gender doesn't have to do jack with how terrible of a person they truly are.

Why how about a story where a mother was told her kid was sick and needed rest but the mother insisted that her son was fine well enough to keep performing in the play only to become unconscious and pass away all because his own mother wouldn't listen.

Or how about another story where both parents a Mom and a Dad treated their own child like property wanting to sell her off as it was her ""given right."" 

So yeah being a terrible person doesn't have to deal with what hangs between the legs but instead with how each given individual acts and treats others. I'll treat everybody the same way they treat me. Be nice to me and I'll do the same in return but treat me like crap and you get the same in kind."
3159,I responded to this half awake this morning and felt completely insensitive when I reread this. Holiday seasons can  bring up foul memories. Apologies.
3160,I meant that she had judge your life and company based on what she thought was normal (which is not). Sorry if I communicated it wrong
3161,That is absolutely horrifying and exactly the reason these men's attitudes of ownership should be more alarming to people. I hope ridding herself of the burden of all that hair helped her find healing.
3162,Was she unconsciously wearing her hair long for him?  Because he groomed her and her sisters?
3163,"Who cares if you shaved it all off? If a man really loves you, he'll see your beauty isn't limited to long, pretty hair. Besides, look at the Ancient One from Dr. Strange! She's badass and doesn't have any hair at all!"
3164,"HAHAHA, yeah. Pretty much."
3165,This is wonderful.
3166,Of course not. That‚Äôs what women are for!
3167,"Yep, I'd much rather have short healthy hair than long damaged hair just to please a man. My hair is really thin and fine. It looks so thin when I grow it out. I'm not going to do that for a man."
3168,"that's why so many women would cut it post marriage, men would sleep on their hair."
3169,I wonder if that‚Äôs why updo‚Äôs were popular in the Victorian era and generally signified she was married.
3170,Isn't he white? Wtf does he know about black hair care?
3171,That guy was nuts.
3172,"We‚Äôre all Medusa, but with dicks instead of snakes."
3173,"I don‚Äôt know if this is true, but I‚Äôve heard that short hair caught on as the male fashion because of army regulations, but who the fuck knows."
3174,"What is obvious to women is that ‚Äúwe men collectively‚Äù DO have an idea. You all know this as you‚Äôre the ones collectively doing it. So why do so many of you individually feel the need to put forth this pretense that you, the collective you, do not."

3176,I think it helped a lot. A simple decision about what she could she could do with her own hair was life changing.
3177,"Not so sure about the ""un""part. I can imagine... Well, I'd be extrapolating from what I've seen. 

Gods, that's ugly to think about.

One advantage of wearing a long skirt is the ability to piss on a grave without being obvious."
3178,No. He insisted that she wear her hair long. Once that evil bastard was dead she was able to wear her hair how she wanted to. She wore it short for the rest of her life.
3179,"Yes exactly! And if they can‚Äôt handle the fact that I regularly have no hair, then explaining the reason why I do it is pointless"
3180,"It's like something to prove now for older women, not cutting their hair, even it would look better, they'd rather attract that male gaze."

This is a [link](https://youtu.be/i0i1CBjLzJ0) to a reaction to his video. I think he has since deleted this video starting at 4:54. He critiques natural hair youtubers wash day regimens."

3187,"Welcome, and I‚Äôm sorry for what you went through. It‚Äôs abuse and neglect. He‚Äôs a piece of shit, and you and your family deserved better. 

They‚Äôre walking toxicity. The silent majority isn‚Äôt buying their bullshit."
3188,"I'm so sorry for that, I hope you're as well as you can be.

Unfortunately, as someone who detransitioned at 17, I saw a lot more of those fetishistic, narsissistic men. It's a cult. You aren't crazy, you aren't alone. Talk to me if you need. People like this stompede over other people, and create a barrage of destruction in their path. If you're not 100% supporting of your father's demands, you're therefore totally against him, and must be demonized and destroyed.

People like this are nasty, they make up the majority of trans cults. I'm sorry you got one of them as your father, seeing how I've seen how horrible they can be.
Best of luck to you, the rest of your family, especially your mother."
3189,Ugh it makes me angry to know that OP‚Äôs father is probably going around saying his family disowned him for being trans when really he‚Äôs just an asshole.
3190,"It‚Äôs like maybe your dad is gay or has a fetish and somehow that equals to being a woman? Like why is it always weird shit like dominatrix stuff? Why isn‚Äôt it like a man transitions and take up cooking or knitting or hair dressing, something stereotypically female and not sexual?

No one wants to transition to just be an average woman it‚Äôs always got a huge element of fetish.  

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this, thanks for sharing. I can only imagine how I‚Äôd feel if it was my dad."

3192,[deleted]
3193,Thank you for sharing your story. I‚Äôve always wondered the children‚Äôs perspective.
3194,"So sorry for what your father put you and your family through. Throughout this debate, there‚Äôs been little to no thought to how the spouses and families of these people are affected. They are expected to suck it up and be supportive, their wants and needs don‚Äôt matter in these circumstances and it‚Äôs fucking sad."
3195,"This is a pretty awesome post.  Glad you figured it out and know that your family is better off without that narcissistic embarrassment who is your father.  He probably has needed therapy all these years and was too proud and selfish to think anything was wrong with *him*.  Everyone else was to blame, right?

You, and we, really are on the right side of history regarding transgenderism which is truly a reactionary movement by men."
3196,"I think your post was articulate, insightful, and definitely contributes to the discussion. I say this as someone who typically is very reticent to welcome males here; just highlighting that this is a good example of what and how to contribute as a male ally. I‚Äôm so happy to hear that your mother and you children are now freed from that abuse. Also,  although I do understand the difficulty, you do not owe your father anything and do not need to remain in contact with him.

Bing-fucking-go!"
3197,"Thank you for sharing your story here.

Sorry about your experiences."
3198,"*"" Rejecting the whole trans narrative has made a lot of things make sense. My dad didn‚Äôt change a single iota. He still has the same fetishes, explosive anger issues, and narcissistic delusions as he always has. But now, he‚Äôs insinuated himself into a community of vulnerable people who are culturally trained to shower him with praise and validation that he doesn‚Äôt deserve. And he doesn‚Äôt care about women past what he can get from them by acting like an offensive stereotype of them. It‚Äôs like a contagious delusion. ""*

This is the most intelligent thing I've ever seen written about the current trans epidemic. It ticks all the boxes in almost every case. AGP/NPD written all over it."
3199,Thank you for sharing your story. When will people realise that  the transcult is a massive slippery slope? I hope you and your mum are much happier now without your abusive degenerate father around.
3200,"Thank you so much for telling your story.  I am the ex-wife of such a person, and although I know I did the right thing in divorcing, I am still occasionally subject to questioning whether my perceptions of my ex were and are correct, so what you have to say about your father's narcissism, his playing the victim, before and after he transitioned, and the added difficulty of having to experience all this in a culture of ""contagious delusion"" comes as a great relief to me.

I am glad your mother (as opposed to your father) sought to act in your best interests as she navigated that nightmare shitstorm.  And as opposed to your father, it's you who sees clearly and are the real ally of women."

3202,"Sorry to hear about that, it sounds like you and your family have been through a lot. Seems like your dad is one of those toxic people who uses their transition as a ""get out of jail free"" card for being a shitty person. At least you're in a better place now, I've gone no contact with a narcissist parent and it's an incredibly freeing feeling, they don't deserve to occupy any space in your head."
3203,"I hope you‚Äôre doing well, even a regular divorce is hard. My parents split when I was a teen and it was very rough on me even though they both had issues and they were both better off apart. My parents had narcissism issues but in the end they‚Äôre still my parents and I‚Äôve had to deal with that. It sounds like your mom and you and siblings are better off without him, it just sucks he couldn‚Äôt have been better for your family since you were little. How about instead of being a girl he dresses and acts like a good dad and puts his kids first? I know that‚Äôs a really far out concept for him and I‚Äôm sorry the world is supporting him in this venture instead of just being a good dad"
3204,"I feel utterly shattered hearing that you are not only aware of your father‚Äôs fetishes and sexual interests but that your father was the one to inform you. Just. Gone. Your father not only refused to model a healthy adult relationship (something I don‚Äôt believe needs to be sanitized, particularly when dealing with older children/adult children‚Äîthere‚Äôs a massive range of healthy discussion to be had between pretending mom and dad have never touched outside of trying to conceive in their entire lives and knowing your parents went to a dominatrix) but then made you, his child, aware of his perversions. Your father failed you utterly, and I am so sorry.

I am so glad that you have your mother and family and friends to help you through this, and I hope all of you have access to the support and resources you need as you keep moving forward. I am so sorry that you all had to go through this. I hope things only improve from here."

3210,"Your story and feelings surrounding this tragic breakup of your family is so important. The trials of the family and the abuse, emotional neglect, narcissism, gaslighting and ridiculous sexual perversions that the family of a Tim is subjected to are never discussed by those that champion TRA bullshit. There are really no resources for families, no support for the people who truly matter - those harmed directly by the narc AGP Tim who has blithely ignored the destruction in his wake. I must say again your voice is so important, and I believe and support every word you've written about your experience. I'm sorry this ever happened, it's so repulsive and sad and selfish of him."
3211,"> But now, he‚Äôs insinuated himself into a community of vulnerable people who are culturally trained to shower him with praise and validation that he doesn‚Äôt deserve. And he doesn‚Äôt care about women past what he can get from them by acting like an offensive stereotype of them. 
>It‚Äôs like a contagious delusion.

Absolutely this. When I read any posts in r/inceltears, they read exactly like transcels. They reinforce the delusions with each other and it is a big circle jerk.

I just can‚Äôt wrap my mind around what a clever, well-orchestrated campaign they have created. There has been such a wholesale buy-in with the woke and handmaidens, as well as the straight community. 

The only possible explanation is that everyone knows that they are men, that trancels scream loudly and threaten violence, so, to keep the peace: compliance with their demand ensues.

The fable of the emperor that wore no clothes comes to mind. Everyone knew that he walked around naked but to avoid his wrath (and possibly their heads), everyone agreed that he wore a beautiful and fine set of clothing.

Transcels: naked and soulless."

3223,What‚Äôs a TIM?
3224,"I am so sorry you suffered through this. I have never known anyone personally who ""transitioned"" but had friends whose relatives did and heard identical stories to yours. Manipulation, histrionics, emotional abuse and narcissism seem to be common themes with the MtF transitioners. I really think it's a serious mental condition and they shouldn't be allowed to mutilate their bodies."
3225,"A problematic strait white male pushing his mediocrity on others, building up this insane boiling over mediocracy?
Edit: the funny thing is I know some great  trans people just trying to live normal happy lives. The kind of people you want to give support to. I feel so ashamed that we allow these guys to be counted with them."
3226,I have a rape fetish. I constantly think about crushing and destroying the balls of men.
3227,"Even coming from someone who supports trans people this is wrong, she or he, it was terrible parenting, sure she/he could transition but what he/she (idk what probouns I should even be using tbh) did was terrible and using being trans as a victim card is wrong, domestic violence is wrong and neglecting ur kids is wrong too. I don't know what's going on inside his head fully since I only know what u have said but from what she/he's done I would say he/she is just using transitioning as another form of abuse, putting stress on the family. Which is also why real trans women who just wanna is put their life without being stereotyped as a violent abuser get abused so badly, because so many people use being trans as an excuse to hurt their family, sexually harass/assault people and other stuff too. It's honestly sickening."
3228,[removed]
3229,I saw this late on top/all and I‚Äôm just trying to understand how you learned the details of your parents‚Äô sex life (the dominatrix thing etc). Did they tell you that? Kinda seems like an awkward thing to discuss with a child...

3234,"I appreciate it, and I think that I'm over the worst of it. I haven't talked to him in years, and my family (especially my mum) are a lot better off for it. I'm just starting to reframe my views of the whole thing, especially considering the awful ways that I've seen TIMs treat women. Thanks for your support."
3235,What do you think about the biology that backs up gay and trans behavior? Do you think it's a choice or are they born this way.
3236,"Fucking called it. Lying about his past to garner sympathy, straight Narcissism 101."
3237,"Every family that doesn‚Äôt kneel is painted with the same brushstroke.

And they‚Äôll jerk him off saying, ‚Äúooh, you poooor thing! Living closeted under those conditions for so long!‚Äù And all the ways that he was a total asshole will be called ‚Äòunderstandable‚Äô as if he is permitted that behaviour for the imagined ‚Äòtrauma‚Äô. Sick fucks."
3238,"S'true, there's always some kind of fetish element involved with the more narcisstic/delusive ones. I don't know if it's repressed homosexuality or family issues or what. Thanks for the empathy, all the anger and frustration about the whole thing is mostly in the past. I just wanted people to know what it was like to live through, to put a human face on the people that're affected by TIMs."
3239,"It can be easy to see that it seems like a lot of TIMs don't transition to be an average woman, but it's cases like these that become more visible and can tug and trigger is more. From what I see the majority of transwomen want to blend in, pass, and be just like a regular woman, but that is a non-story so it won't seem as common as cases like the OP's."
3240,"Yep. If my father had been a decent person, we probably would have supported him through the transition. I don't know if my parents would have stayed together, but if there had been mutual love and support from the start, we would have helped him through it. He drove us all away and blamed us for leaving. Kids don't disown loving parents."
3241,"And, I believe, one of the TIMs, along with Andrea James and Lynn Conway, who attempted to ruin Michael Bailey's personal and professional life (threatened his children; reported him as unethical to his university department) after he published ""The Man Who Would Be Queen"" (downloadable for free as a pdf), about autogynephlia.  An investigation by Alice Dreger (a researcher on intersex conditions and an advocate for intersex people) investigated and concluded Bailey had not acted unethically."
3242,I'm sorry you had to go through all that too. I hope you're in a better place now.
3243,"Have you told your story here?  If not, are you willing (or able) to do that?  Our stories (I'm the ex wife of an AGP TIM) need to be told."
3244,We're going to see a lot more of this. I think the voices of the children victimized by this horrible trend are the key to exposure.
3245,"Yeah, my mum and siblings went through therapy and came out on the other side pretty well off. I drank a fair bit in university and used that to get a handle on things. Not exactly the healthiest means of therapy, but it worked eventually. Life really is so much quieter and better without him."
3246,"I'm glad to hear that, I was worried about 'crashing the party', so to speak. I've been no contact for longer than I've known what no contact is, so no worries on that front."
3247,"""Contagious delusion"" is exactly, succinctly correct."
3248,"This is not the most intelligent thing ever written about the trans epidemic, many many women have said exactly the same and equally or more eloquently. Can we not go overboard with the praise just because a man blessed us with his opinion?"
3249,"Thanks, I will"
3250,"Amen to all of that. No contact is hard to get to, but it can be so very healing."
3251,"We're all very much better psychologically. It's been long enough that we've all moved on in our own ways, and are doing well in life. Thanks for your concern."
3252,"Thanks for the resources. Places like this and /r/raisedbynarcissists have helped me work through a lot of things, and I have a solid group of friends, so I'm doing alright."

3259,"Well, I'm glad to hear that. Your family deserves it, after what you went through. It's sickening how fetishistic they are, and now he's dating people half his age."
3260,There is no ‚Äúbiology‚Äù backing trans behaviour. It‚Äôs a cultural phenomenon. For adult male AGPs transitioning like in the example here it‚Äôs a manifestation of patriarchy that arises from bingeing on porn and male entitlement.
3261,[removed]
3262,Jesus what the fuck is it with these narcissistic psychos. All the trans people I know (usually in discord servers where there are more people I like than don't so I tolerate them) are just the weirdest most self serving people I know.
3263,I think being pornsick (bingeing on porn) has a lot to do with it. It warps their brain.
3264,"Hahahaha no. They wouldn't be parading their dicks around the women's locker room if that were the case. And that's just the autogynephiles. I do a co-ed activity that for some reason still unknown to me attracts a ton of HSTS. And they can't shut up about how they think they are superior to actual women, how vaginas are gross, how actual women don't know how to suck dick or do makeup like them, etc.

They have little to no interest in women for any reason, or actually trying to be one. They are focused on men and getting men's attention. The main time I really see them paying attention to any woman is when they are jealous she is getting a lot of male attention.

But autogynephiles especially have zero desire to blend, except for specific cases of individuals who are turned on sexually by blending."
3265,"Do you really see the ‚Äúmajority of TW wanting to blend in and pass‚Äù? Or is that just the narrative we get told ad nauseum? Every single TW (without exception) I‚Äôve seen/read/heard has demanded attention, and validation - going from merely dominating the discourse, wanting to be centre of attention, telling women we are wrong through to this sort of destructive, fetishistic, narcissism that tears families apart and causes trans widows to suicide."
3266,"It *used* to be that way for many trans people.  People have been able to change their gender for several decades, and there weren't any major issues with those trans people trying to invade single-sex spaces or censor speech to fit their narrative.  They were subject to extensive gatekeeping and were expected to pursue SRS, and WANTED to pursue SRS to alleviate their dysphoria.  

Now most trans people want zero gatekeeping, no SRS, and forcibly infiltrating single-sex spaces and taking opportunities that aren't *meant* for them.  They say they don't even *have* dysphoria, yet they expect the taxpayers to not only cover their plastic surgeries but also their electrolysis, waxing, hair transplants, custom wigs, etc."
3267,"I agree. It's not that trans people are all visible and trying to be special, it's that those are the ones people keep focusing on because it's a better story. The large majority are just living normally and trying to pass. Very few people are just randomly choosing to transition because they want to be special. Trans people face discrimination, that's hardly something that someone's going to choose."
3268,"I've often said that what really drove me away was my ex's narcissistic entitlement.  In the end I have ended up being glad he was such an unempathetic and demanding person, or I might have talked myself into believing I could live with a person who demanded I remake myself in his image (of woman and much else)."

Now, if you‚Äôd like to continue, please speak out to acquaintances, friends, colleagues, other family members, neighbors, etc., and share what you‚Äôve learned here. It is an unfortunate truth that your voice has more of an impact as a male. Please use it. Seriously. It does matter. Many of us cannot speak out openly without fear of violence or career suicide. But men have been exempt from this. Please use that power. Speak out."

3280,Take it as you read it. No agenda. Just curious.
3281,"Well normally would agree, but this is being pushed by some very powerful people."
3282,[removed]
3283,"I'm definitely not trying to discount your own experience, of course, but I think that even if *some* trans people were born with that predisposition, the majority of people who are going trans these days *are* making a choice.  

When you think of someone ""choosing"" to be gay, it sounds awfully implausible because there's a lot of discrimination and shame that is still attached to being gay, plus it doesn't seem like someone could *force* themselves to be attracted to the same sex if they actually *weren't*.  

But if you think about a straight man who has a fetish for imagining himself as a woman, then turning trans lets him fulfill his fantasy full time AND with the current social and political climate, he can claim victimhood, oppression points, and maybe even tons of free, taxpayer-funded surgery.  

There is less and less gatekeeping, so such people wouldn't even have to go through the bother of getting extensive therapy first.   They also can gain an almost unlimited narcissistic supply as they take over women's spaces and censor their speech.  

Finally, if the TIM is a straight man, then he *doesn't even have to change his sexual orientation*; he can just call himself a transbian and continue fucking women.  If a man comes out as gay, nobody would fault his wife for wanting a divorce, but if a man comes out as trans, his wife is cajoled or even *bullied* into staying with him

I *do* believe that some trans people have some kind of inborn susceptibility to this, but they seem to be very much in the minority today and are frequently derided as ""truscum"" by their own community.  The majority of TIMs now don't have to bear the financial, social, or romantic costs that the old school transsexuals did, and somehow it's even okay for them to keep their penises and *still* demand to be recognized as women.  Figuratively *and* literally, they don't have any real skin in the game."
3284,"All I can guess is that the (modern) movement attracts that type... besides old school TIMs, that I could kind of understand due to external & internal homophobia; it seems to be a different story with hetero TIMs, where they're just misogynistic AF at the heart of it all.       

Besides times/ places with extreme homophobia, why else would men decide going ""transition into a woman"" (a very stereotypical one at that)... unless they're being motivated for nefarious reasons...    

Notice they never really want to women -- they just want to pick & choose the parts they see as ""fun""... all the sexual aspects about it scream narcissism too when you think about it -- wanting to possess faux female body parts for themselves as their personal built in sex toys to get off to whenever, is as narcissistic & misogynistic as you can get.         

They don't even stay consistent with APG either, by claiming it doesn't exist one min, then trying to claim that one shit survey says women are APG just like they are! üôÑ"
3285,I think so. That's the sense I get from watching transyoutube videos or in subrreddits where trans people post about how they are so happy to be able to pass and not cause any commotion. Seeing the lengths they go through for this I suppose is a testimony as well. I think most trans people don't want others to know they are trans.
3286,"Yeah, I think like many issues and stances in life the truth or ""proper"" approach is somewhere in the middle. Like a pendulum it is probably the responsibility for both sides of debates to push back on each other to find the appropriate point in the middle (i.e. appropriate amount of controls before medical transitioning or other rights is allowed). I just hope both sides can find enough empathy and step in each others' shoes to find this middle ground unfortunately inevitable with any growing population there will always be bad apples. I hope good ones can eventually dominate the narratives, regardless of which side they are on, and open dialogue be preserved no matter your stance."
3287,He's a massive douche. Agree entirely. The stalking and online abuse from him & his fellow AGP narcissistic fetishists that Alice Dreger describes in Gallileo's Middle Finger is pretty chilling.
3288,Google it.  It's easily found and down-loadable.
3289,"Exactly. People will always find a way to foist blame on the women who speak out, but this same crap versus children is no match."
3290,"I'll do what I can. I've been testing the waters with my friends, and some of them seem receptive. I do think there are more people that reject the trans narrative than it appears just because of how loud TRAs are."
3291,Are you asking me to prove something that does not exist? ü§î
3292,"That's just from my own experience speaking. I don't believe transgenderism is innate, however, that's just speaking how it affected me. Then again, i was labeled ""truscum"" for who i felt, because i believed to be really trans, you need dysphoria.

Speaking from people who expereince real, legitimate gender dysphoria, as i did, it's not a choice. But, AGP transsexuals are making a choice i feel."
3293,"It‚Äôs exemplified by the names they choose - Munroe, Charlotte-Rose, Michelle-Lynn, Chloe, Veronica Ivy etc. - it‚Äôs never plain old Lisa, Kim or Susan is it?"
3294,"Right now trans widows don't get any sympathy from mainstream culture.  I am not usually a fan when men post here, but I am thrilled that men (sons) are starting to speak out about the damage trans culture is causing.  When men start speaking out, they will be listened to, and maybe we will see a shift."
3295,"Absolutely there are. But no one feels comfortable to be overt about it. That‚Äôs why I advise that the best thing that you can do is ask questions and sew seeds of doubt. Don‚Äôt introduce talking points in their fully matured form. TRAs and liberals/handmaidens etc. have been inoculated against this. There are many ways to bring up a subject without naming the subject, and you‚Äôll find that when you approach it from this angle people easily agree with a central point. If you were to label it, then they‚Äôre able to deactivate thinking because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been trained to do. But nine times out of 10 they agree with you, and enough of those add up and a person starts to feel the dissonance. Just remember that anytime that you feel nervous because you‚Äôre around a bunch of liberals, the fact that you are male Does protect you. Look at all the people being raked over the coals for going against this ideology; they are all women, no men, not really. You can speak out and return to your regularly scheduled programming. If you want men like your dad to stop abusing, this is what you can do to contribute to the larger movement."
3296,There has been some rudimentary research done on how people reach ‚Äúpeak trans‚Äù. One was when they encountered a toxic TIM - whether IRL or online (e.g. Jessica Yaniv was a gift for us). I imagine you sharing your story with people in your life could have the same effect.
3297,Yes. It isn't an unfalsifiable belief and I posted videos that confirm the opposite.
3298,I agree with this. It would be great if more men talked about this.

3327,"I got called a nazi earlier this month for saying there were two genders. If believing that there are two genders makes you a fascist, then literally everyone outside of western liberal information bubbles is a nazi, 99.9% of people worldwide before 2010 were nazis, nearly every one of of their liberal and LBGT heroes of the past are nazis, and pretty much everyone in the non-English speaking world is a nazi.

3328,"This is what's so terrifying to me, to segue off of your ""protect trans kids"" line: since the word ""violence"" has been redefined to include things like misgendering & and anything that comes from a terf's mouth, the things these TRAs think they're ""pretecting"" trans kids from is just the mere idea that said kid won't be allowed his/her strong cocktail of life-changing hormones. Don't forget: gatekeeping *is* violence, and it's of utmost importance to protect these kids from rational-thinking adults who realize it's a bad idea to allow kids to make such life altering decisions!"
3329,The ‚Äòprotect trans kids‚Äô signs are everywhere. It‚Äôs the next campaign - affirmation-only counseling for children who think they‚Äôre trans. I‚Äôm not even kidding. Shit‚Äôs about to get real.

3331,"I think it says a lot how lesbian pride and other non-TRA related pride parades/events are always really positive and kind-minded, while TRA ones are always about excluding people such as 'terfs' and 'cis men/women' and whatnot. Hmm, I wonder which community I'd trust more."
3332,Who are you talking about
3333,"I had a similar experience at the NYC Dyke March. There was a group that had a banner that defined lesbian as ""female homosexual"" and march organizers formed a blockage and stopped them from marching.

In fact the people forming the blockade were totally blocking the sidewalk and one person screamed at me and my friend to get out of the way and pushed us off the sidewalk into the street with heavy traffic. I was PISSED.

I didn't realize what the hub bub was about until after the march and saw a video posted online. I remember pointing out the banner to my friend at the time thinking it was cool, but I didn't put 2+2 together until I saw the video.

They have utter contempt for lesbians."

3347,">The sheer number of English-speaking people who use gender instead of sex 

It's from filling out forms. Honestly. You fill out so many forms in your life, and that is usually on there. So you see it as a synonym. I never thought gender meant ""stereotypical behavior associated with one sex"" -- to me it just meant male or female."
3348,"My mom used to study sex differences. Apperently the title of her project (""sex and ..."") Made people uncomfortable. I'm not sure if it was a life scientist or a policy person or what but that's riddiculous. She was studying biological sex differences, it wasn't about gender. I think we should all do our best to use correct and precise language."
3349,Thank You
3350,"Back in the day forms used to say sex. The old joke used to be people writing in ""yes please"" on forms under sex. It's only in the last 15 that they started using ""gender"" or ""preferred gender"" and sex got phased out almost entirely.

I remember seeing a form like that at the doctors office and it seemed so stupid to me, your sex is important information for a doctor to have. There's important material reality things a doctor needs to know about your sex, like calculating how much anaesthetic to give, I find it so irresponsible to ignore that just to not hurt people's feelings."
3351,"Good to know. But when I have to fill out forms, it‚Äôs always written ¬´¬†sex¬†¬ª. Never ¬´¬†gender¬†¬ª. In French, in Spanish, in Dutch. Always: SEX.

I'm happy he found love after recovering from his awful losses. He seems like the type to fix his own stuff before getting a new gf."
3354,"Good for him, I can't believe he's 55."
3355,"AND they‚Äôve known each other for a long time AND she‚Äôs an accomplished artist in her own right. That‚Äôs all so refreshing. 

I feel like kindness and better than basic human decency is the secret to his apparent lack of aging. Him and Paul Rudd. (Dear Paul Rudd, please be a decent man. Don‚Äôt ruin this for me.)"
3356,He was quite open about some of his trials and the fact that he was lonely. It‚Äôs safe to assume that he has many options but opted for fruitful connection.  Heaven forbid he takes the oath less travelled and actually likes who he‚Äôs with instead of being consumed with novelty.
3357,I‚Äôve honestly never heard anything bad about Keanu Reeves. He seems like he‚Äôs got a good head on his shoulders and isn‚Äôt led around by the dick.

3359,"I don't know why internet guys are getting mad. They look happy and that should be what matters. At least Keanu isn't some creepr like other hollyweird guys.

I think she looks very stylish. Nice to see some guys still have common sense not to go chasing teens and 20 something's into their 50s. There's something that be said for relationships that are genuine instead of superficial business transactions."

I know it's their personal business who they date and all but it's refreshing to see that they're not all like that and that *some* hope yet can be held out for men. Keanu seems like a cool guy all round üëç

There's still *kind* of an age gap but it doesn't really matter as much when both parties are over a certain age, at least logarithmically speaking. It shouldn't be such a nice surprise to actually see an age appropriate relationship play out in Hollywood but there you go..."

L O A D S  of professional women choose to dye their hair platnum or silver blonde when they start greying 

who do these people think they're talking about? 

do they think keanu is some magic perma 30 yearold because he has different genetics and is greying at a different rate (also opting not to dye/change his hair so its less noticible)"
3386,They are a stunning couple.
3387,Very cute! I love her hair.
3388,"when I first saw this, I was actually surprised by her grey hair and assumed she was older, but when I read the caption, I saw that she was actually younger than him, then I was surprised to find out that Keanu Reeves is 55?! then I started thinking about the movie industry and how that shit is sexist and agist af. and then in that context, I reread the caption and was actually pleased that it wasn't being trashy or mean. I'm sure that THERE ARE people being mean and salty about it, but overall, I think the public's love for Keanu will minimize the hate slung at her."
3389,"Wtf? What do they want from him? She‚Äôs 9 years younger than him, at their age that‚Äôs completely acceptable; it shouldn‚Äôt matter what she looks like, that‚Äôs ridiculous and shallow. How selfish and delusional do you have to be to be mad about him finding someone that makes him happy?"
3390,Is that actually his girlfriend? Lots of articles are saying it's his long time friend.
3391,I read the /r/pics thread about it and most of the comments were very positive. Only a couple negative ones.

3396,Guy picked someone within his age range. I seriously don't see the problem here.
3397,She's nine years younger than him ffs they should calm down.
3398,"Keanu is known for being a good guy, and good guys don't go after women 20 years younger than them, so this shouldn't be a surprise, but most men are nasty so of course they're mad their hero isn't gross like them. All the guys throwing mantrums about this are just proving they're trash. Like imagine being upset about this.. Lol Wish them the best, Keanu has been through some rough times and if he really is as good a guy as he seems then he deserves some happiness."
3399,"I just saw another article where this 60+ year old guy and his wife divorced (they were both famous but I forgot who) the wife was 60+ as well and you know who he starts dating after they dicorce? A 21 year old. Yes a 21 year old. Are you fucking kidding me? And he probably only picked a girl that ""old"" so he could leagally drink with her."
3400,"I dont get what the big deal is.  She is 10 years younger than him, which is barely is his age bracket, but even if she was his age, who cares?  Im personally sick and tired of how celebrities get such a huge amount of praise simply for doing stuff that is completely normal.  Im 29 dating a 32 year old and I just get berated for it because im settling and Im a ""loser"" for dating an older woman who is overweight.  

Nothing against Keanu, though his advice for lonely people was pretty ignorant and verging on insulting, but I dont get the huge amounts of praise celebrities get for everything they do."
3401,"Good for the both of them! 

I read the comments on Twitter and it made me so angry.  People lamenting that she looks old for 46 and couldn't possibly be that young can go screw themselves. How pathetic. This woman is confident, elegant, beautiful, and successful.  Something they'll never be in their entire lifetime. 

Right on, Keanu. You go on and live your best life."
3402,"Keanu really is the best of them. And Alexandra is lovely! I wish them a happily ever after, Keanu definitely deserves that."
3403,Keanu has always seemed pretty decent. He donated almost all his paycheque from one of the Matrix movies to charity - that's several million. Does lots of work for charity. He's a handsome fella too. It's not a surprise he dates in an age-appropriate way.
3404,The most upvoted most active post here is about a man who's dating a woman 9 years younger than him. What the fuck

3412,lol this just stokes my love of Keanu Reeves even more XD god forbid he have an age appropriate gf and not be a freaking predator XD
3413,Keanu is one of the few caring stars left.  Good on him. Especially with those earlier sadnesses in his last relationship.
3414,"Actually I saw a lot of positive comments about it on whatever sub I saw it on a little while ago. People saying they were happy for him.

I mean, it is celebrity culture so they're going to judge her lol. Men are not alone in this. Most people seemed fairly polite wherever I was reading. Most ""rude"" comments were just like ""I can't believe she's only 46."" Which is a reasonable (if not especially sensitive) reaction to have.

I did not, however, notice anybody fuming."
3415,"So happy for Keanu. He had a traumatic past that really made me feel for him. 

I am so happy to see him happy and healing üíú

Thanks for sharing OP. Hopefully Keanu will heal by example ‚ù§

3418,I love that she has kept her hair grey instead of coloring it.
3419,"I was like, oh no, he's not dating a TIM...? Urgh. Yeah, she looks super cool."
3420,She has a beautiful and kind expression. I would have been crushing on her in my twenties. Good for Keanu I wish them the best. lol at the haters

3455,"I had a friend who knew him (my friend has passed away). They went to school together at Toronto School for Performing Arts and played hockey together. He said everything they say about Keanu is true, he‚Äôs just a very genuine, humble and generous guy."
3456,seriously!! my first thought when i saw the woman Jeff Bezos cheated with is that at least she's age appropriate. the bar is so low for men.
3457,"> Men are pathetic.

Another norm.

What really gets me is how older men who are wealthy or famous are EXPECTED to have a girlfriend 1/3 his age and is celebrated for it but if and older woman has a much younger boyfriend, she as seen as a ""cougar"" or a whore or someone who is almost basically a pedophile (funny they don't see the irony).

There is also this double standard where if a young women pursues an older man, she is seen as a whore or having daddy issues but if a young man gets with an older woman, he is a hero and she is still called a whore.

And don't even get me started on the whole ""she's past her prime"" nonsense which never applies to men.

It seems in any\every situation, women can't get a break but the penis pass is always granted."
3458,"""Middle aged celebrity has girlfriend a scant 9 years younger"".

Keanu is blameless in this, but the gushing from the sidelines are so depressing. That it is a big deal at all says so much about our society."
3459,"I dunno, the news I've seen is all in the context of Keanu not having had a girlfriend for *decades*. That's kinda newsworthy, as far as celebrity news goes? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3460,"The hilarious part is she is still a decade younger at the ""appropriate"" age for a celebrity male's partner."
3461,"It‚Äôs really amazing how people will say such horrible things about celebrities spouses. Deborah-Lee Furness, who is married to Hugh Jackman, gets a ton of shit for her appearance as well."
3462,"I asked my mom what the hell I would talk about with a man double my age. She said probably the great depression. 

Seriously most people that age have hobbies and interests and lifestyles that aren't the same as a 20 year olds.

I'm 35 and I wouldn't date a 20 year old. Too far apart. Even 25 it's unlikely. When it's 55 to 25 it's just bizarre"
3463,"""We all agreed that women over 30 are worthless and then Keanu Reeves goes and ruins everything!"""
3464,"I convinced my mother to stop dyeing her hair about 10 years ago. I was still a kid but her grey started showing through and I said it looks nice. She told me she'd gotten lazy with dyeing but I told her nah, let it go completely grey - it looks cool. She did just to try it out and hasn't dyed her hair since. She has a big, curly grey head and I think it looks dope. My pops doesn't like it but mums doesn't give a fuck lol."
3465,Which is funny because I think she‚Äôs an absolute knockout! She has such cool vibes.
3466,"Heck at least he hasn't gone like DiCaprio and dating young enough to be his kid. 

Keanu seems like a genuinely okay guy. It's refreshing to see a guy connect with a woman and not have it be about age imbalance and control."
3467,I mean 55 to 46? 9 years at that age isn't much. Would anyone really hate on that?
3468,10 years is nothing in your 50s.
3469,I‚Äôd love for someone to say my relationship wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòfine‚Äô outside of the effing internet so my boyfriend could tell them to blow it out their ass lmao.
3470,"Remember those posts about him doing the ""hover hand"" when posing for pictures with female fans/celebrities? Men on here flipped out, saying it must be because he's worried about false sexual assault charges. Like, maybe he just respects women's personal space, you weirdos üôÑ"
3471,Shit men are deeply invested in the idea that all men are just as shit as they are. Evidence to the contrary makes them mad. And they can‚Äôt call Keanu a cuck or whatever so that makes them even more mad.
3472,"Because it crushes their entire paradigm.   So many incels and neckbeards especially think that if they were just ""rich and famous"" that they could get a hot, young woman.  It ruins their fantasy when they see a man who obviously just wants a real partner."
3473,"Homosociality. Their way of proving membership and dominance to in their male friend groups is through the ""conquest""of the most attractive women. It has nothing to do with sex or women or happiness, it's all about making yourself seem cool to your bros. When a man cares more about his actual relationship with a woman he loves than what his friends think, it pisses them off (extends to celebrities they admire, even when they don't know him). He's supposed to ""get"" the sexy women to ensure his rank among mandom - if he does not do this, he is breaking the homosocial code."
3474,"Because if Keanu Reeves (a good-looking, rich, and successful actor known for being a good dude) dates someone who is close in age and ‚Äúonly a 7‚Äù or what-the-fuck-ever, then what hope is there for them?"

3480,How can you tell?
3481,">People lamenting that she looks old for 46 and couldn't possibly be that young can go screw themselves. 

&nbsp;

Severely enforced cultural standards train an otherwise intelligent animal,  humans, to have a lazy eye (brain, actually). People see silver or grey hair and think ""old."" 

&nbsp;

In post-colonial societies with Western-inflicted self-esteem complexes, any woman or man with a light complexion was deemed a great beauty and any dark-skinned person an ugly brute, totally irrespective of facial features. 

&nbsp;

When I moved to the West, I observed how conditioned people, especially males, were to considering as ""conventionally beautiful/handsome"" any blonde-haired person with a slim (female) or tall (male) build, again irrespective of facial features.

&nbsp;

>How pathetic. This woman is confident, elegant, beautiful, and successful.

&nbsp;

I agree totally."
3482,">Well, good for him, but would he work with the Wachowski ""girls"" again?

An important question. I will never call any man a woman, full stop, but that goes double for those two male fetishists of female-female sexual expression who fraudulently collect accolades designated for Women Directors and Women in Hollywood."
3483,Indeed le question. Tbh I think he's amazing and v feminist but not radical probably
3484,There's another Matrix movie set to film in 2020 and Keanu is on board.
3485,"The bar for men is on the floor. I like Keanu, but this worshipping of a multimillionaire celebrity gives me bad aura. Personally I just accept all men are garbage so I can enjoy my ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù ones while still being a radfem."
3486,"Yeah. This is fucking weird. This is not supposed to be a celebrity/gossip sub.
Straight women need to have hope I guess üôÑ"
3487,"HAHA, truth."
3488,"Same. Shocked to see this swooning over a male in this sub. Swoon away, I guess, I'm as heterosexual as they come, but this is an inappropriate context to be reading something like this. This thread legit ruined my day."
3489,"**RIGHT?!**

What the everloving fuck. What sub is this? What has this place turned into? I genuinely want to cry. This is the death of another radical feminist space."
3490,"I guaran-damn-tee that there are dudes mad about it.  
If you look, you will find dudes mad about \*anything\*.  Being mad about things outside ourselves allows us to avoid looking at ourselves.  

I don't know that most dudes are mad at Keanu Reeves, but I'm sure more dudes are mad on the internet about it than happy about it.  (Very few people go on the internet to vent their healthy well-wishing of a distant celebrity that they don't really know.)"
3491,You'd have to go to the incel subs.  Shortcels called her a hag.
3492,"It doesn't, this sub is now TwoX Lite"
3493,Talking about age gaps in culturally significant relationships is not ‚Äúthe death of radical feminism.‚Äù Sheesh.
3494,What‚Äôs worse is that this thread has so many more comments and upvotes than threads about REAL issues facing us. This is not a celebrity gossip thread and Keanu‚Äôs choice in women does NOTHING to help us. I don‚Äôt come here to learn about celebrities no matter how ‚Äúsubversive‚Äù their choices are to culturally approved misogyny right now. I come here to be united with women under a dire reality that needs our focus and attention. Really hope this place doesn‚Äôt go downhill. I have nowhere else to go.
3495,Thanks. Wtf is this man stanning?

3498,"Oh my God. In a recent interview the one who calls himself Lilly (he's an enormous, hulking male in a bad wig) actually admits that trans pornography ""unlocked something"" in his brain. He said this. In public. SHAMELESS. https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/rambling-reporter/lilly-wachowski-talks-trans-visibility-rare-public-appearance-1228603"
3499,"I'm going to have to disagree, he is a good looking dude through good genetics, lifestyle and I'm guessing a touch of well done surgery. He doesn't have that synthetic look like Tom Cruise or John Travolta.

If he was just an ordinary guy he would still be killing it on the dating scene, even without the fame."
3500,"thanks for the honesty. I'm pretty sure if you had that power, the novelty would eventually wear off. I mean, he's 55. he probably just wants to settle and be happy."
3501,"Him and his gf lost their child when when she went into early labor. The death of their child made them split up but they were seemingly still pretty in love with each other, just lost. She then not long after died in a horrific drug induced car accident and after that he stopped dating for over a decade."
3502,"

Edit sorry she was pregnant and they had a stillborn then that caused separation and sometime relatively soon after she died in a crash"
3503,"I think we're so used to seeing men with women half their age that this looks shocking. (Also, he is very well-preserved indeed.)"
3504,She's 46. Still much younger.
3505,oh that explains it lol my chinese ex was 47 and looked 35 lmao
3506,"""Asian don't raisin""

... But when the old age hits, it hits *hard*"
3507,"Also good genes. Have you seen that picture of his father after he got out of prison? Dude was 50+, had been on heroin for years and years, and then spent a decade behind bars. Still looked years younger than he actually was. So Keanu hit the jackpot genetically, even though the guy was a deadbeat otherwise."
3508,"He probably lives a healthy lifestyle too. No drugs, very little alcohol, kept his weight stable, etc."
3509,I know right!
3510,he's only 5 years younger than my dad and looks at least a decade younger lol
3511,I know!! The amount of respect I have for Keanu reminds me how shit the overwhelming majority of males are yet expect applause
3512,"I don't know, I personally think he's just got those Ashkenazi genes where he's going to do all his aging all at once, like how one day Jon Stewart suddenly looked like Hanukkah Harry. It's just like, some of our men go from zero to sixty *real* quick. And then they spend the next 30 years looking like they're 75."
3513,"Isn't he of mixed-race heritage? We frequently don't age in the same ways as white people. I'm 56, and am told (often) that I don't look it, people usually guess around early 40's. Look at photos of Keanu when he was young, and you'll see the difference. He was baby-faced from the beginning."
3514,I lost it at the plastic surgeon part.
3515,She seems way too nice to be an asshole.
3516,I've been to Dollywood more times than I can count. Dolly would never!
3517,"Either dolly is some kind of PR witch, or nobody on earth from has a bad word to say about her because she's a good human. Occams razor says the latter!"

3521,"i think that's pretty true, i never thought about it but def see what you mean"
3522,God could he be any more respectable? üòç
3523,I do vaguely remember him saying that. It‚Äôs all part of his evolution I suppose.
3524,That makes me so happy. I try not to celebrity worship too much but I just love him.
3525,"Did you hear the story about when he was at that movie theater in Sydney, way back when? Beyond adorable."
3526,Yes they were all butt hurt that he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbanging‚Äù a string of 18 year olds and gave his ex wife half his billions. I mean... she supported him for over a decade. Very low bar indeed
3527,The bar is on the floor yet so many of them can‚Äôt even reach it.
3528,>Women just can't win.
3529,"This is terribly off-topic, but in your mini bio next to your name, I thought at first that ‚ÄúTILF‚Äù stood for ‚Äúterf I‚Äôd like to f***‚Äù and I was like, ‚ÄúAs a woman who likes women, I can get behind this‚Äù üòÇ"
3530,I have a girlfriend 9 years younger than me.
3531,"If an older women is with a man, then she's awful somehow. But apparently a guy can date teenagers or 20 something's even when he's old enough to be their dad. I don't understand it."
3532,Also Pierce Brosnan's wife.
3533,"I'm approaching 40. I can't imagine dating a 79-year-old: or, for that, matter, a 20-year-old."
3534,"When I was 18, I had a HUGE crush on my English teacher, a guy who was 32.  At 18, I was thinking to myself that the age gap wasn't THAT big, and that I could totally get him.  


When I turned 32  and remembered my grand plan, I was so disgusted by the thought of dating an 18-year-old, I still haven't recovered.  


Now I'm 35, married to a 51-year-old man.  It's 16 years, but we didn't meet when I was a teenager."
3535,He hasn‚Äôt changed society views tho. One person can‚Äôt changed that
3536,Duck you loser asshole women over 30 are Not worthless. You are worthless now go play with a lighter and gasoline.
3537,Duck you loser asshole women over 30 are Not worthless. You are worthless
3538,"Yes, she's beautiful."
3539,DiCaprio is dating someone he knew when she was a child. Nasty old geezer.
3540,"Not hating on, just observing. And I do acknowledge age differences matter progressively less with age."
3541,"they are both ""middle age"" in my view. maybe that's subjective, but i personally think they are age appropriate for each other. its when someone is a fully developed adult, say a 30 year old man, and then goes and dates a 20 year old who isn't even fully physically matured (brain wise and body wise) that it just seems creepy to me. she is an accomplished middle age woman with an accomplished middle aged man. that is appropriate in my opinion. if you're gonna date a decade younger, that's how one should do it."
3542,And maybe he has his own personal space wishes lol. Maybe they should try to aim for it
3543,"They cannot understand the idea of not wanting to make women feel uncomfortable. Don't want to venerate basic decency too much, but imagine if all men were like Keanu."
3544,Yet they‚Äôll still get mad at women for saying ‚Äúmen ain‚Äôt shit‚Äù lol.
3545,Young women are real
3546,"Yeah I noticed this. They're basically angry he's placing a woman over the entire class of men. But he gets genuine affection and connection from her, whereas he'll just get internet praise from sad incels.

It's pretty obvious which path a well adjusted person would pick."
3547,Yes... their primary source of status is each other... it‚Äôs obvious that these men could have sex with as many barely legal women as they want. The real offense to the Manosphere is that they dare to choose women based on factors other than purely looks/social status.
3548,Great comment
3549,"That's very interesting, I didn't know that there was a word for it."
3550,"Cause she has wrinkles, like a normal person"
3551,double?
3552,"There were rumors in 2015 about him dating a TiM actor named Jamie Clayton, but I think that was Clayton's publicity machine.  Also, Clayton has worked for the Wachowskis as well, so there's that connection."
3553,No doubt full of CGI.
3554,"I mean yeah, obviously they do exist somewhere, but yeah, as you said, not most."
3555,"If you look, you will find dudettes mad about *anything* as well"
3556,Yikes
3557,K?
3558,"It's still a big age gap, she just doesn't look super young for her age because she's a normal person and she has gray hair.   


And 90% of this thread is just gushing about how Keanu Reeves is the only good man, best celebrity, so great etc."
3559,Yeah fr why is this the post with the most comments???
3560,? that's a lot of emotional concern for someone who has agency and chose something they wanted
3561,"She wasn‚Äôt pregnant, their baby was stillborn and she died later in a car crash. Horrific"
3562,:(
3563,"She wasn't pregnant at the time. She was pregnant but had a miscarriage, and she died not long after in a car crash."
3564,Yep. I was actually expecting to open this thread to see him dating a 21 year old.
3565,And silver hair color is a fashion color nowadays. So what's the big deal?
3566,same!
3567,"I'd love to see this picture, do you have a link by any chance?"
3568,He‚Äôs definitely doing things right.
3569,Dayummm must be the chillness and meditation.
3570,"His forehead is very smooth for someone who is aging au naturel. No shade, though. He's lovely."
3571,"Yes, he's mixed race. Half English, one fourth Chinese and one fourth Hawaiian. Good mix."
3572,"Well if you know where you lost it, go back and get it!"
3573,Have you seen that bit in Derry girls where erins mum makes her ‚Äúswear on dolly‚Äù and points to a portrait of Dolly Parton? That show is so good

3575,"That's not what u/notochord is saying. Rather, as one inevitably ages, whether they are nice or mean comes across in their default face."
3576,Nothin wrong with that!
3577,"Around the time the MeToo hashtag blew up someone made a fake NYT article that said something like ""Breaking news: Keanu Reeves takes woman out for coffee, is extremely nice to her"". It still cracks me up."
3578,?? tell me more.
3579,"They tried to paint her as a gold digger even though she was with him BEFORE he started Amazon. She also did accounting and other work for the company in the early days. Not to mention that she left a prestigious job of her own and moved across the country because her husband wanted to start an online bookstore. Meanwhile, if she'd put her foot down and put her own career goals first, these same men would be talking about how career women are ugly feminist bitches who are gonna die alone or whatever.

Men like that want women to be powerless, hence the hatred of ""career women"" AND the hatred of SAHMs. This is the same type of men who hates ""Western women"" because we've been ""ruined"" by feminism, which is why he goes to Asia/EE to find young, poor, usually prostituted girls to exploit."
3580,Happy Cake Day!
3581,"""Terf I'd Like to Fuck"" is pretty damn funny and I am shocked that never occurred to me but what TILF is meant to stand for is Trans Inclusionary Liberal Feminist."
3582,Hahahaha...thanks for my giggles for this evening.
3583,"I get that. I probably personally wouldn't date a man that age at 35 currently. My step dad was born in 65 though. I don't want to care for 3 aging people at the same time lol!

I dated a guy that was 39 when I was 21. Lopsided awful thing. Really hurt me too. I can't imagine doing the reverse! It sickens me. 

If I decide to date this year I'll cut it off at 45 to 28."
3584,"Uffda, you're definitely going to be his nurse

I just watched my grandmother smile and laugh for the first time in a decade, after my 94 year old grandfather **finally** died. They were 22 years apart and we watched her soul die while she played nursemaid to her aging, ailing husband.

It's like caring for a very large, very angry baby who can voice their entitlement and verbally abuse you. They fought *constantly* when she became his nursemaid.

She was a husk, broken, just a tool to tend to his needs. Him dying was finally her freedom. She travels now, has friends, is able to leave the house whenever she wants.

Just a heads up."
3585,"My partner and I have a 10 year age gap (we met when I was 32, he was 42.) Been together for 15 years now, mostly very happily. No kids, both of us childfree, so that was never an issue either. I always was into older men and I know some of it goes back to childhood issues to me, but honestly I just found so many boys and then men so immature for their ages I just never had any interest in most men my age. We run into the occasional generation gap issues but it's pretty minor for us and often just a joke re: what music and tv we grew up on. But I could see it being a bigger issue if there was a bigger gap between us. 

I recognize and we have talked about the fact that I will likely outlive him but I'm ok with that; I spent the bulk of my life being very independent and am already planning on how to continue being so when I am older. Will probably end up living together with a bunch of my women-friends who never married, never had kids and are happy that way."
3586,"Ugh, that's even worse. How can he think that's okay, especially when he knew her as a child. That's beyond creepy. 

I guess that means he knew her parents then. Why aren't they objecting to this? He's clearly a predator, going as young as legally possible."
3587,I felt really icky when I saw the photo of him with Greta. I hope he doesn't go after her in a year or two.
3588,ü§Æ
3589,"Honestly in this #metoo era I'm surprised he has continued to get away with this kind of behaviour. Has he been declared immune or something? I thought no man however powerful or influential or popular was supposed to get away with this kind of thing anymore?

Also I'm starting to think ""dating"" is entirely the wrong word when it comes to DiCaprio. His pattern seems very much to be ""enjoy/drain them of/prey upon their youth and naivete for a while before discarding them and moving onto the next one"" üòë"
3590,"that is monumentally creepy... ugh.  also, anyone else notice how much creepier he looks while he ages lol"
3591,I meant the public in general
3592,"Of course they are.  But most people don't find a true partner in someone who is of a completely different generation.  It definitely can happen, but that is rare.  You just can't relate to someone on an equal level who is 30 years older or younger than you."
3593,">their primary source of status is each other

I love how so few words perfectly encapsulates the current male social paradigms on the grand scale. Of course there's few like Keanu who simply don't let it get to them and live their lives and love as they please, but so many other men do all of the shitty things and hurt other people and choose partners (instead of other ""lower status"" partners they may have better compatibility with) *all because they want to impress other men.* Not because they want to be happy, not because they think it's what's best for themselves, it's all just to look good in front of other men whose opinions they take way too seriously.

^(not gonna lie, that seems kinda gay--especially considering these dudes are usually homophobic AF loool)"
3594,"I found that term years ago and ever since, many things clicked and make a lot more sense to me. You would think that heterosexual men would prioritize heterosexual sex and relationships, but many heterosexual men are primarily homosocial. They are homophobic at the same time, so it creates a very odd dynamic. They can‚Äôt express their feelings toward other men without fearing being seen as ‚Äúgay‚Äù. One of the only ‚Äúnon gay‚Äù ways they have of bonding with other men is through their ‚Äúconquest‚Äù of women. Creates a very weird (and bad) situation for all of us, especially for women who are used by these men as pawns in their dominance game. It really has very little to do with sexual pleasure or connecting with women.

By the way, I think a lot of heterosexual women are primarily homosocial (self included)- we prioritize female-female friendship over heterosexual relationships, even though we are straight. But we don‚Äôt really need that word because this is seen a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for women and it‚Äôs not a problem for women to express our friendship love for other women. Women can prioritize female friends without worrying about losing our social standing among other women."
3595,"She had a miscarriage/stillborn that made them separate from the grief, then died 18 months later in a car crash."
3596,Oh I mixed that up
3597,"Ha, now when my husband comes home I'm going to have to examine his forehead for comparison. He'll ask me what I'm doing, and I'll tell him I spent a good fifteen minutes looking at pictures of Paul Rudd's forehead today, and I can almost guarantee that his exact response will be ""Oh, of course. As one does."" 

Anyway, thank you for giving me a good excuse to waste time looking at pictures of Paul Rudd. For science, of course."
3598,Yum
3599,There's a nice Roald Dahl picture of this idea.

3602,"And lets face it, bookseller out of the garage doesn't scream wow he's gonna be rich"
3603,That's why FDS is not to date a project man. They will leave/cheat once they have all the money. Find a guy who is successful now (though I guess this did work out for her in the long run - I'd rather have billions than a guy)

3609,"> I guess that means he knew her parents then. Why aren't they objecting to this? 

I hope and assume the daughter is of legal age at least. Which in turn means, the parents might be objecting to it, but what can they do? They can't exactly tell their adult daughter she cannot date whoever she wants.

""well she should have chosen a better mate!"" have lots of casual sex? sl*t. have no sex? boring, prude, ""no guy is going to put up with you if you don't put out by the 3rd date!"" 

it's just their way of wearing us down so we settle for whatever scraps we offer. good thing more women than ever are realizing that being single is better than being a surrogate mommy to a manbaby and marriage rates are lower than ever :) that's why incels blew up- more women than ever are educated and employed so less and less of us need to marry/stay with abusers or risk destitution."

No wonder Lohan now sells herself to Saudi rich types and Hayden had a breakdown.

3621,"Yup, it‚Äôs very unfortunate what happens to most of the females in the Hollywood world.
Britney Spears, Amanda Bines... they all had breakdowns for very valid reasons."
3622,true :(
3623,"I've just looked her up. The mother, who is younger than DiCaprio, goes with them on dates sometimes. That is beyond weird."
3624,"Wait, she has mental conditions? If anything that would make her more likely to be abused. Girls and women and I think people with disabilities in general are abused sexually at a far higher rate than your average person.

I just see how young people in the spotlight are chewed up and spat out. I remember being young and totally judging Britney Spears for going 'crazy', it's so clear to me now why that happened. If anything I'm astounded she didn't end it all. I hate my past self for judging her and I hate to see the same sort of grief being levelled at Greta now."
3625,"I am not bitter; I am merely pointing out something I have both experienced and observed.  I dated a man 20 years older than me, and though we had chemistry, we just could not gel on the same level I could with a man my age.  And I have seen this again and again: people with huge age gaps rarely have relationships that work."
3626,It sounds like you are very bitter about the truth.
3627,"Haha thanks :) I‚Äôm more of a commenter than a poster at this time. I wish I had saved some of the links where I read about this way back when. Your googling is as good as mine, I‚Äôm sure. Try ‚Äúhomosocial men and sexual conquest‚Äù bet you‚Äôll find some interesting things."
3628,"We don't live that way anymore, though. We don't do a majority of the things we used to because we've evolved as a society. ""It's natural"" or ""cavemen did it"" are not good enough excuses for rampant misogyny and patriarchy. It's possible to bond with other men without hurting and killing women. It's a choice men make to display dominance.

You know what's way more powerful than brute force and murder? Mercy. Forgiveness. Love. The things men despise and shy away from, preferring weak, cowardly violence. It's not a good thing to bond with violence, especially sexual violence. It fucks up everyone involved.

This is a pattern of behavior men are keeping around purposefully because it benefits them materially. They *could* hug it out and say how much they care for each other‚Äîthat's a better way to bond than getting together and gang raping some women in the Tribe. But they choose group rape over hugs. It's a choice.

None of this lizard brain cavemen nonsense excuses or explains men's current behavior. We don't have to hunt and gather, there are no mammoths or sabre tooth tigers attatcking us, *there is no danger to bond over.*

All of the recent wars the US has engaged in have been about money, power, and showing dominance. They're bonding over that‚Äîthe sexual violence and dominance‚Äîand decidedly **not** bonding over being brothers in arms defending the Tribe."
3629,"Mehhhh I don‚Äôt think it is evolutionary. I think it‚Äôs part of the enforcement of the patriarchal nuclear family. There was once no issue with men loving other men as friends and comrades. But that doesn‚Äôt work for keeping the primacy of the insulated nuclear family under capitalism. People might.. like share resources or something! Capitalism no no.

Homophobia and toxic masculinity aren‚Äôt necessary for evolution, but they are necessary for patriarchy. And anyway, hasn‚Äôt it been questioned recently- the idea that men were the hunters. I‚Äôm pretty sure all hunted together way back when."
3630,I think it‚Äôs bc it comes across like you‚Äôre fetishizing his ethnicity
3631,"Yup, and now I hear a lot about MBB being ""introduced"" to older male directors. Of course, there's no public proof but her entire family relocated from Britain and her parents quit her jobs to become her full time managers when she was young so it wouldn't surprise me if they were that desperate for fame. Especially with the news about Drake that came out."

3636,that is totally bizarre...
3637,"Ok, first of all, it's one thing to list a series of behaviors that are more favorable, as opposed to actually enacting them. Unless people are consciously aware of the effects and the root of their behaviors, it doesn't matter what you think is more favorable.

And secondly, I'm not disagreeing with you. I merely pointing out that there is a root to these behaviors that at one point WERE necessary for survival. But yes, they are vestigial imo, and we can do without them."
3638,"Gosh. That would be an extremely specific fetish to have.

3642,Have you ever looked at her Instagram? She doesn't even hide it! It's really sad.
3643,wow she was doing so well with her stage career in UK too... I heard she fell off the wagon again after that. so sad.
3644,Millie Bobby Brown.

That's what I kept thinking throughout the article.

There is nothing stopping the TIM participating in powerlifting for fun. Why do they act as if they have a right to compete, when in their own division they wouldn't have ever had a chance due to being mediocre?

What about the women athletes' desire to compete, which the TIMs infringe on?

Also: ""trans athletes should be celebrated fiercely"".

No they shouldn't. Why should they? Why should mediocre men be celebrated at all when competing with women? It's the women pushing the capabilities of their body that ought to be celebrated, bit some enourmous awkward-looking blook with long hair who fancied a go 18 months ago.

>	Removal of Testosterone today does not remove the advantages of Testosterone in the past.

>	Although it is clear that reducing T to female levels does reduce current muscle size and red blood cell levels in males, it does not reverse the impact that T had during puberty. Puberty and early adulthood was when the size and shape of the male body was formed. It is well known that males are larger, have longer limbs, a larger rib cage with larger organs like heart and lungs, bigger hands, their legs are more vertical due to a narrow pelvis, the list goes on. The male body is optimised for physical performance. In contrast, in females there is an evolutionary trade-off between physical performance and the ability to bear children.

>	Future advantage due to muscle memory:
There is considerable scientific evidence now that muscles built under the influence of Testosterone will be easier to build in the future even in the absence of Testosterone. Links HERE, HERE. ‚ÄòMuscle memory‚Äô means that if an elite athlete takes performance-enhancing drugs, they may continue to be at an advantage over their competitors even if they stop taking the drugs. This is why elite athletes can have their titles removed retrospectively if they are later found to have taken performance enhancing drugs at any point in the past (not just at the time the title was acquired).

>Therefore it is likely that male-born transgender athletes who once trained under the influence of natural testosterone will forever be at an advantage over female-born competitors never exposed to such high T levels. Read an excellent short review on this topic HERE.

>	Even low levels of male-competitive advantage will dramatically change sporting outcomes.

>Suppression of Testosterone by male-born transgender athletes undoubtedly reduces their athletic performance. However, the key question is ‚Äòby how much?‚Äô It is highly likely that some competitive advantage will remain due to being born and developing as male. This is also borne out by the observation that many male-born trans-athletes are rising to the top of female competition. Link HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE.

>Seeing male-trans athletes rising to the top of female sport is inevitable because the difference between winning and losing at elite level is so small. Analysis of the performance differences over the last 3 Olympics confirm exactly how small that difference is. Link HERE. The average difference between winning Gold vs Silver is only 0.8%, for Bronze and no medal is 0.4% and making the final or not is 0.3%.

>Male-bodied people start out with a 10-30% performance advantage over females. Even if just a 1% residual advantage remains post-transition this is still more than enough to radically skew the medals table and world records."

What TiM‚Äôs are really trying to say is black Woman are more masculine and less woman then a white woman. That‚Äôs the crux of this foolish argument.

3753,"It's a little complicated. There are some really vocal supporters of transgender activism who are black, generally they are young black women and black gay men. 

I have always thought this is because in the black community, most of the trans-identified males we're exposed to are people who have been trans since they were teenagers, suffered through prostitution and other indignities, and are usually not very activist at all. They exclusively date men. Most of them are actually gay men and they are our relatives and while the black community has a reputation as being homophobic, when push comes to shove we are far less likely than other groups to exclude our people because they're not straight, like cutting people off or disowning people. So we stay around each other.

The trans activist types posted about here in GenderCritical, well many of them are more like fulltime crossdressers who identify as lesbian so they can get closer to women's spaces. I have never known any black trans male who identified as a lesbian, not saying they don't exist now, but that is well outside the norm for us. I've seen black trans people since I was a kid and never seen a Caitlyn Jenner type either, the kind who don't transition until they're late in age. 

So I bring all that up because I think the young woke black people who support trans activism have our kind of trans people in mind. Outside of them, I think the opinion on this is very strong in skepticism towards trans activism, very strong. "

If they're comparing women in the same country, is it possible that 'black women' are more likely to be manual workers or spend all day on their feet compared to the 'white women'?  When you consider the racial/ethnic stratification found in social classes, & we know class impacts education, which impacts types of employment), we could argue instead that it's being working class that increases bone density & that black women are more likely to be working class."
3756,"Just an aside...North America has around the highest calcium consumption anywhere in the world (‚ÄúMilk dos a body good‚Äù and all), but we most likely have such poor bone density due to the amount of animal protein in our diet, which requires our body to pull calcium from our bones to keep our blood alkaline enough.

The 2 women don't want what you're saying, to be the greatest and most beautiful and all that. They just want to live their lives in the body they are most comfortable in, and very rarely draw attention to the fact. Nothing changed between pre-reveal and post-transition personality, they're both  still the same mates I had before, just more stereotypically girly. 

As for the man, I didn't even know he was originally a woman, I just thought he had a bit of a baby face. It was only when I mention he couldn't make an event because he was getting his boobs cut off (he was flat chested every time I saw him prior to this) that everything kinda clicked.

The problem is that those crazy activists are the ones who have the power to change laws and shape the narratives of what it means to be trans. They're not just crazy SJWs screaming into a void. They are changing laws and getting women fired from their jobs for saying ""Women are Female"" and ""Jonathan Yaniv is a predatory man"".

And, not only that, the few trans people who go against the grain and speak out against things like childhood transitioning and males in female sports are basically excommunicated from the trans community and labeled ""TERFs"" along with the radical feminists.

&#x200B;

This might sound mean; but until the sane trans people take control of the narrative and speak out against the trans activists who are seeking to strip females of basic rights and castrate gender non-conforming children, I don't think we're wrong to generalize them in the way that we do.

It's not your responsibilty as an individual, it's our responsibility as a collective society to prevent having your rights stripped away. Similarly, why is it the responsibility for the regular trans woman to care about your rights being stripped away when you label them as crazy activists? Because by being empathetic and working towards common good and harmony society is improved.

>But how are we supposed to know the difference between ""regular trans women"" and predators like Jonathan Yaniv? 

How are we supposed to know the difference between regular teachers and predators like Abbie Swogger, or regular pastors and predators like John McFarland? There's a percentage of predators in every group and there's a percentage of people in that group for the sole purpose of being a predator. So to answer your question - when people like that are exposed, lock them up for a long long time, just like anyone else."

That's a false comparison. You can't compare some teachers abusing their power to the inevitable consequences of allowing males free access to intimate female spaces

&#x200B;

Also, prevention is better than cure. I'd rather prevent sexual assaults by keeping males out of female spaces than just arrest creepers ***after*** crimes have been committed.

&#x200B;

IMO, this wouldn't be an issue if gatekeeping still existed for people wanting to legally identify as trans and enter spaces intended for the opposite sex. But, because trans people threw tantrums and threatened to kill themselves if we didn't do away with gatekeeping, we now have the issue of predators like Yaniv being allowed to just put on a pink hat and claim he has a right to lurk around little girls in the bathroom. 

&#x200B;

> Similarly, why is it the responsibility for the regular trans woman to  care about your rights being stripped away when you label them as crazy  activists?  

Because THEY are the ones demanding that society change the way it handles language, intimate spaces, women's rights, etc for the sake of ""validating"" a subjective internal identity. Even the ""regular trans women"" are making demands that I change for them and compromise my comfort/safety so they can piss/shower/change where they want.

And why would somebody want to pay another for sex?  I've never understood it.  Okay for $500 you get someone being nice and flirty for 30 minutes which I guess is a major reason men like this - it's more than just sex its the talking, the flirting, the touching - and as soon as their time is up, the act is over, and they don't want to have anything to do with you until you come up with another $500.  I don't see why any dude thinks this is ok.  

I'm sure some dudes confuse it with love and beg prostitutes for marriage and their bubble is burst when they find out none of it is real and the woman is only acting that way because money is involved.

No wonder so many men who are attracted to this have anger issues.  There's no real intimacy or connection yet it seems like there would be.  The only reason the woman is there is for the money.  She would be thrilled if the guy would just hand the money over without her doing a thing.

A discussion about problems which affect women, especially online, can rarely take place without interjections of 'what about this corollary problem faced by men?' Of course it's a problem, but that's not what is being discussed right now.  So really MRAs are wasting everyone's time, because instead of taking the time to campaign and advocate for their problems, they distract feminists from addressing their problems as well."
3891,"I think they're just saying that those ""shitty "" jobs are being marketed to young boys- they may not be comparable to sex work, but they are the "" male equivalent"" of "" shitty jobs"" that the OP mentioned. But yeah, coal mining is nothing is compared to sex work. They're just trying to say that the OP is a little off."

3893,so the article was about the girls giving anal sex with their penis then?
3894,Teen Vogue also published an article by a TIM on things he did before hormone replacement to feminize.  I guess the audience for Teen Vogue is teenage TIMs...
3895,"Bonus if you have IBS or any other serious constipation, any injuries you get during anal will never heal. TMI but I have had a chronic fissure for 5 years after giving in to the porn-made pressure to just do anal. Liberal feminism is anti-woman and actively fucking hates us."
3896,"Yep. And men of all sexual orientations hold responsibility for normalizing anal sex. For fucks sake, we have Dan Savage, a gay male, exhorting straight women to have anal sex with men. Sexuality is destruction for males and as a group they are all more than comfortable with pushing that on women of all sexual orientations."
3897,Thanks I hate it
3898,">daily diarrhea and anal leakage?

Instead of ""Backdoor Sluts"" and ""Step Sister's Anal Punishment"" --- all those VILE titles, they should be called ""Anal Leakage in Training"" or ""Debbie Does Diarrhea"" --- maybe pile on the buzzkill like that. Though I realize there is surely a market (and probably a big one) for anal leakage porn. I just made myself sick."
3899,"And Teen Vogue's most targeted demographic are tweens. Here's a ""delightful"" tidbit..

""I have got you covered. Without all the run-of-the-mill hoopla, here is the lowdown on everything you need to know about butt stuff, no matter who you are, whom you‚Äôre having sex with, or who you want to have sex with.

This is anal 101, for teens, beginners, and all inquisitive folk.""

The thing about ""run of the mill hoopla"" is teens have no clue about ""hoopla"", they're teens."

3903,"The very one. I don‚Äôt think it says that women don‚Äôt have prostrates though. Vagina owners and non-prostate owners  are included, however. 
> Just because you have a vagina does not mean anal is off-limits. Many vagina owners love anal play.

The title of the diagram (which as you observe is woefully missing the clit) is ‚Äúanatomy of a non-prostate owner‚Äù. Goes on to make the case that anal penetration is a good way to stimulate the clit. 

No thanks."
3904,That's the one!
3905,"I think it's just because most male prostitutes are bought by men--and that's not a homophobia thing, that's a man thing. Men have fewer qualms with buying people for sex than women do. I seriously doubt very many lesbians are into buying women...no more than straight women are into buying men. (Which is why female prostitutes are assumed to be servicing ""Johns""...do we even have a female ""client"" name equivalent?)"
3906,"I think you're reading this wrong - at least where I live, rent boy is just a general term for a young male prostitute rather than implying anything about sexuality. OP is just talking about how sex work as work is marketing exclusively to girls, and never boys, and pointing out a blatant double standard. There is nothing about sexuality in that statement and certainly nothing homophobic - you're the one suggesting men having sex with men is demeaning. Also, the vast vast vast majority of people that visit prostitutes are men.  What world are you living in where women visit prostitutes at anything near the rate men do?"
3907,"Male prostitute is bad because straight men might have to fuck people they don't want to have sex with! (ie men )

Oh but woman love having sex so them being a prostitute is ok, no matter who they fuck!

It could be that ""rentboy"" is just slang for male prostitute...but became connoted to be for gay men since that's where the demand is. It might be that all slang for male prostitutes has this connotation since mostly men buy people. Should we be using slang for prostitutes at all? That's probably the real question."

There is no ""custody issues"" that affect men unless you think murdering one child to spite the mother and still even after that getting access to the other children is an issue negatively affecting men, maybe because it makes them all look like absolute psychopaths. If a man asks for custody, he gets it. He can be convicted of any number of crimes against children in general, women in general, his own children, the mother of his children - makes no difference. ""appropriate custody"" is generally little to none (considering how mammalian reproduction works let alone our society), which most men sensibly settle for.

Men don't hide their emotions either. Anger is an emotion.

You are really just repeating MRA propaganda, which is patriarchy propaganda."
3949,">suicide rates  

No, the higher suicide rates are because men are naturally more violent so they're better at killing themselves, it has nothing to do with ""discrimination"" or ""evil women"" of any sort.  Women have a higher suicide attempt rate, but a lower success rate.  There's nothing we can do about either of those."
3950,"Men aren‚Äôt discriminated against for custody issues though. Men don‚Äôt actually want custody of their children.

What we should REALLY be doing is getting these women into programs where they can get a job with health benefits and where they won‚Äôt be at risk of violence. 

If strippers and female waitresses aren‚Äôt safe from male violence how in the world will a woman who has to come into intimate and close contact with men be safe?
Female waitresses get their buts slapped and felt up on ALL the time. 

Porn stars experience rape and coercion. There was just a lawsuit against a porn company who was lying to women about what they‚Äôd be doing and what they‚Äôd be paid. And then when they showed up they were forced to perform or figure out how to afford to get home. 

Sex industry uses women. It‚Äôs not empowering. It doesn‚Äôt protect us.

3955,Wrong. Again. Stop posting here.
3956,"Yeah, absolutely. I think just the way they did it was weird. not even in a bad way. neither asked if I did, just both said its really really bad for you and you shouldn't do it.

3965,"Sorry you can't read. I said if you found stats that say 6%, that proves women aren't the market."
3966,"No. 91 percent of custody cases were decided without the court system. 51 percent of them resulted in unanimous agreement that the mother will have full custody. Only 4 percent of custody cases go to trial and of that 4 percent, only 1.5 percent completed custody litigation.

There is no court bias to speak of. Men just don‚Äôt want to see their kids."
3967,key word 'liberal'. Liberal feminism is the movement that centers men (especially TIMs).

Great job standing up against this shit! Glad they realized how incredibly misogynistic it is and fixed it."

3986,You need to get a more permanent sticker. A bunch of them.
3987,"Changing men's rooms to ""gender neutral"" makes far more sense for existing restrooms.  Actual males and wannabee men can use the mens.  I see transmen as being subjected to being kicked out of the women's restroom when they really pass well, just as a few transwomen pass well and are left alone.  

As for  new construction, if all restrooms are going to be gender neutral, women will never have privacy or security again.  I fear that it will be a positive sign for predators to ply their criminal behavior even more toward women and children.


I never thought I'd consider myself ""lucky"" to live in a politically conservative area, but as far this issues is concerned, yeah, no one would put up with trans nonsense--so far."
3988,"That happened briefly at one of the women‚Äôs restrooms at school, but it didn‚Äôt last a day. "
3989,"You know what? If I ever see that in public, that there's a male bathroom and a gender neutral one, I will just go to the male bathroom and see how they fucking like it. I think maybe more women should do this, albeit in a large group so that no one can try anything. And if the men asks, just say you're gender non-conforming. I'm sure after a while, the men will raise the alarm since their voices hold more weight than ours."
3990,"This place I went to the other day just had a women‚Äôs bathroom with a woman silhouette and a men‚Äôs and womens bathroom with a men‚Äôs and woman‚Äôs silhouette on the other one. I think we should push for that. Men‚Äôs bathrooms should be for men and women and women‚Äôs bathrooms are for only women. Everyone but women that want privacy, go in the other one!"

Weird how that happens. "

3994,Awesome!
3995,Thank you!
3996,"I'm glad you did that. Women are socialized not to rock the boat but taking away our spaces is too much. We can't let the invasion of men take place. Let men have their own bathrooms. If a man is scared to go into the men's bathroom in case he gets attacked, well...men need to work their own shit out and stop being so fucking violent and aggressive. The women's bathroom is not a refuge for anyone who wants in. I'm sure people saw your note and it sparked ideas in their minds. If even one woman saw and was reminded that her rights matter, that's all that matters!"

4005,Right on.  Need more of this from sane people IRL. 
4006,"Good for you. I wish I'd had the guts to do something like that when my uni's student's union decided to turn the upstairs women's bathroom in the SU Hub into a GN bathroom but left the men's room alone. After that, the toilets were always covered in urine. It was revolting. Any woman studying or praying upstairs and in need of the loo had to go down two flights of stairs for the only female-only bathroom, whereas the men could just take a short stroll to either one of the now-TWO options available to them upstairs."
4007,Is that not vandalism?
4008,You only need a male and female bathroom. Everyone thinking something else is denying basic biology and lives in a bubble and also shouldn‚Äòt be paid attention to.
4009,"i like the idea of only gender neutral restrooms, if they change the mens as well they can have 2!"
4010,"The reason why they put it on the women's is because the men's has urinals. 

Those without penises can't use urinals well"
4011,[removed]
4012,"I‚Äôm a bit confused. I don‚Äôt mind a men‚Äôs bathroom to be gender neutral but how exactly are you going to deal with urinals? They‚Äôre probably the most efficient thing in bathrooms from water usage, time and comfort. My University‚Äôs bathrooms has 6 cubicles in the women‚Äôs bathroom and 2 + 3 urinals in the males bathroom and, despite there being significantly more males in my degree(70% or so) the women‚Äôs bathroom is always more full. 

It seems logical that there would be a urinal bathroom and a normal bathroom which are both gender neutral."
4013,"No, the best response is to point out the fact that federal law separates bathrooms by sex, not gender. If this state school gets any money from the federal government then they are likely violating the law by not providing each sex with separate bathroom facilities. I would recommend contacting OSHA to start and maybe emailing the school's legal department with this code. 

Title 29 of the code of Federal Regulations Part 1910 Section 141 1910.141(c)(1)(i)

https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.141

>Except as otherwise indicated in this paragraph (c)(1)(i), toilet facilities, in toilet rooms separate **for each sex, shall be provided in all places of employment** in accordance with table J-1 of this section. The number of facilities to be provided for each sex shall be based on the number of employees of that sex for whom the facilities are furnished. Where toilet rooms will be occupied by no more than one person at a time, can be locked from the inside, and contain at least one water closet, separate toilet rooms for each sex need not be provided. Where such single-occupancy rooms have more than one toilet facility, only one such facility in each toilet room shall be counted for the purpose of table J-1."
4014,Yes! I would have moved it to the men‚Äôs but the men‚Äôs room door is in view of a security camera and I wanted to stay anonymous as possible. 
4015,"Women's restrooms already are more heavily used than men's, often have queues waiting while men's are available. I recall not too long ago there was one city(NYC?) that mandated twice as many women's restrooms as men's at newly built facilities such as stadiums to address this issue. How times change in just a few years."
4016,"Not always.  One restroom at one of our sites has the former men's room converted to gender neutral.  And even though that restroom has likely never seen a TIF I heard some men complaining about it.  

Besides ""women are nurterers and want to help TIMs be comfortable and if you don't agree then simply screw what women want"" I could see the average person's logic also being that men might be uncomfortable at open urinals with women walking past.  Also there is probably magnitudes less demands coming from TIFs.  

Regardless: hooray for anyone who stands up to this nonsense.  "
4017,So your solution to the problem is to move the problem so it doesn‚Äôt affect you negatively
4018,[deleted]
4019,because the women are the only ones complaining?
4020,The sign was laminated and I wrote in white board pen. I didn‚Äôt want to be accused of destroying property 
4021,Fuck. Has anyone brought this to the board‚Äôs attention? 
4022,The sign was gone completely 
4023,Phew üòÖ
4024,"Damn good points here.   
Regarding the part about predators in the women‚Äôs rooms, I love when people say ‚Äúwell right now lesbians are allowed in the women‚Äôs room and they could be hitting on/preying upon other women‚Äù.    
You know, because having a woman with a woman‚Äôs body get aggressive with a woman means the same level of danger as having a man with a man‚Äôs body and strength attack you. Definitely exactly the same.   
Oh but that‚Äôs right, their kind doesn‚Äôt believe that women and men have different bodies. It‚Äôs just politics in all the medical resources where they document that men have on average significantly more muscle and less fat than women.   
I also love when they say that a woman can take a man in a fight if she‚Äôs close to his size or larger. Obviously these people have never seen the real life outcome of that kind of matchup. If he‚Äôs not holding back, the woman could die.   
These people are completely divorced from reality. "
4025,"Sorry, I don't normally comment (cause man) but it seems relevant.

The reason this issue exists is that men aren't bothered by it. This isn't due to ""strong men"" or something ridiculous, it's just the resulting comfort of a privileged class. The entire world is our space, so having a separate one really isn't important. They also aren't at risk for assault, don't have periods like women do, and don't really experience sexual harassment (to anywhere near the same degree). If I saw a women in my bathroom I would not be bothered. I'd probably just think ""huh, good for her,"" and go about my business.

And, of course, since this applies to us it must apply to every other human being on the planet /s. Or maybe it's just that it doesn't affect us, so these guys don't care."
4026,The TIMs will use the women‚Äôs room though
4027,I disagree. Men deserve privacy as well. They don't want women seeing their dick and I think that's fair.
4028,"In my university they had gender neutral bathrooms that alternated between using the men's and women's rooms by floor.  Every other floor had the men's room as the gender neutral bathroom, and every other floor had the women's room as the gender neutral bathroom.  "

We had all been talking on the sub and thought it was for TIMs but then I realized it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs always women in the building but only rarely men. It still made me feel more like they were accommodating me as a woman just to know that we aren‚Äôt holding a placecard for a man in a place that men don‚Äôt frequent.

I‚Äôm not going to a bathroom with men in it. So if that happens I am not spending money at that place anymore. I wonder if they will just end up making one person bathrooms the thing now and having them be like unisex. "
4053,The TIMs or women? Men would love to have women in the bathrooms with them tho. LOVE.
4054,Gender is bullshit. The right word is unisex.
4055,"Studies have found that in order for toilet provision to be ""equal"" for men and women, there need to be about twice as many women's toilets than men's.

4072,"Smaller bladders, need to change menstrual items 25% of the time, bladders often damaged by childbirth and more frequently impacted by infection than men, plus anatomy that takes a bit longer to wipe.

4073,Are those bathrooms with stalls or single occupancy? 
4074,"Please don't forget that moms bring their kids into the women's bathroom the vast majority of the time. If every 10th women had 2 kids with them, that's 3 extra people peeing. My husband would bring the kids with him when we were out together, but that was not the norm, since I was home with them and running errands with little ones in tow."
4075,"Love the idea of making the men's room the gender neutral one. Understandable if men feel uncomfortable at the urinal but it's extremely rare that women are going to physically threaten them. Just awkward.

Like that the drive to be protective/nonaggressive is focused on men. I hope that most men would have the decency to be protective against a vulnerable man or woman. 
If they aren't, then why put it on women to be the police? "

There is no actual proof this was posted by the school rather than some random person. The first step would be to get the school to acknowledge it happened with their approval, not easy. Most schools have a stamp or some kind of indication it is approved by the school.

The fact that your only comment was about not blaming men, nothing about the situation "

4099,"On Friday, both (basement) bathrooms had signs. I took the sign off the women‚Äôs toilets. 

Monday I missed school (migraine)

Tuesday there was a laminated sign solely on the girls which I wrote on. 

The other floors had the signs (I was told) but my school occupies one room we rent from them daily in their basement. "
4100,This wasn‚Äôt on campus. This was a flexible workspace rented by the school and we meet there with a teacher who usually is at the school. The days the signs were put up when another group had rented a different room on our same floor of the building. This group was full of GNC women and one TIM. 
4101,"Is this strictly the case, pregnancy and menstruation aside? The impression I‚Äôve gotten over the years is that women don‚Äôt need to urinate as often because we are simply better at holding it in, which does make sense from what I‚Äôve observed. I know you‚Äôre not meant to hold it for long, but with the state of public bathrooms most women I know would rather wait until they got home if possible. Genuinely asking because my experience is generally that of waiting for the guys to run to the restroom unless we know those bathrooms are kept clean - then the rest of us might pop in if we needed to."

4106,Ah. Thanks for filling me in!
4107,If it's rented by the school esp if it's for a teacher then it falls under the requirements of the school for their federal funding. It might be that students put them up without approval from the school. You should still file a grievance to have it on record. 
4108,Choosing to not use a public restroom and hold it is different from not needing to use the restroom.
4109,Are you taking into account the fact tha men may well go more but they just go... wherever. Also I think women tend to suffer with GU probs such as cystitis and pelvic floor issues relatively frequently.
4110,">The impression I‚Äôve gotten over the years is that women don‚Äôt need to urinate as often because we are simply better at holding it in

Actually, it's the opposite! Women have shorter urethras and smaller bladders, so we actually need to urinate *more* frequently than men do. "
4111,Men are benefiting from it.   
4112,"That‚Äôs part of why I was posing it as a question, because I really have no idea how frequently I and women I know would use the toilet if it weren‚Äôt for that. I‚Äôm so used to holding it since being a kid that I don‚Äôt go right away even when I‚Äôm home. "
4113,"Well, I also don't know or spend time with men who are happy to just go wherever, beyond what I said about knowing women who aren't fans of public toilets (which is less of an issue if you're just standing to pee, but I have also known guys to hold it when the bathrooms were bad enough - liquid on the floor is usually a hard no!)."

Or maybe it wasn't fast at all and I just was slow on the uptake.

I don‚Äôt know if anyone else has experienced this but I‚Äôve had people assume that because I‚Äôm speaking out against the trans agenda they assume that I‚Äôm a homophobe because they can‚Äôt distinguish between the movements and see LGBT as one homogeneous mass.

Most other people falling for the fantasy in question are either well meaning and dumb or just too used to letting men do whatever it is they want (and also to promoting self hate among women who feel the need to transition so they can be ""enough"").

I am starting to consider that we are going to need more whistleblowers than social change to get better at this point. Records of big pharma pushing opioids have been making it to the public in the last decades and the same will happen to trans issues, I believe."

Now I'll admit I don't need to understand it, at the end of the day I don't really care what others do with their own body, but now it's getting to a point where NHS are giving teenagers hormone therapy. Kids who aren't old enough to buy energy drinks in Scotland (actual thing look it up) are now being allowed to make a life altering decision that will fuck up their bodies hormone balance. Just imagine the absolute havoc that must wreck on a 16 year olds body. 

Source is I know a 17 year old that has been undergoing hormone therapy for a year.

Also the reason I was getting frustrated with LGBT is because the trans community is so loud and aggressive in their agenda it really his the message of the LGB communities. Will happily say it's not LGB that was frustrating me."

How would they be excluded? They're included under the ""G"".

Trans people are no more excluded than redheads, black people, or (heaven forbid) furries.

They just have to be actually homosexual or bisexual.

Only trans people (and redheads and black people and furries) being excluded are heterosexual ones. This is an organisation for non-heterosexuals. Just as Stonewall used to be.

It's not terribly complicated."
4175,"That ""being broken away piece by piece"" part is what we have to be extremely careful of, though, because vast swaths of the public has not been paying any attention to any of this and will absolutely persist in lumping trans with lgb.  They aren't following any of this and don't grasp the nuance and if they see lgb and women's rights getting stripped away along with the ends of things like trans in women's prisons/shelters/sports/scholarships/political-appointments they will just perceive it as ""oh, okay, the pendulum swung too far.""  No, the pendulum was *hijacked* in a totally different direction.

4190,I suppose in a similar way but to a lesser extent libfems have made feminism look bad for us. I remember when feminism was out of style and young women spurned it but now they have their own brand of feminism that is very different from the original intent. It's like the offspring have turned on the parents.
4191,We can't change the LGB without the general public thinking we have invented a new nightmare group set up to destroy the world. I really think that now we have laws protecting LGB people in most countries (some are never going to have gay rights) that the community needs to be quiet and settle down into the ordinariness of humdrum society. Pride marches have been taken over by T so perhaps they could be scaled back or re-purposed.  Acceptance and blending in with the crowd is what was aimed for in the first place.

I assured her not all LGB people agree and many want to distance the movement from TRAs. You may be surprised to find out that your friends and family are not on board, but like you are being silenced out of fear of being labeled a bigot. I'm glad she felt like I would not judge her and that she could ask me an earnest question. Perhaps there is someone you know like that?"

Respectfully, that's not what happened. The progressive wing has been focused on economic justice, and the neoliberal wing has been pushing identity politics. I often become confused when people attribute the sjw/identity politics phenomenon to progressives, because as someone who was deep into the 2016 election and closely follows politics here, that's not at all reflective of the truth. Maybe the neolibs tried to coopt the word ""progressive""? There was an attempt but I didn't think anyone bought it."

4205,"When Russia first opened up their ""Internet Research Agency"" they had no real objective other than simply to create chaos.  They supported anything that might be divisive or get people angry.   For example, they managed to create a pro-Muslim online group and then scheduled an IRL rally for that group outside a mosque in the United States.  At the same time, they created a separate anti-muslim online group and then scheduled for that group to have an IRL rally outside that same mosque, at the exact same time.  Neither group knew that the other group was going to be there, and neither did the local police, so there was definitely potential for violence.

They also liked to inflame racial tensions.  For example, whenever there is an incident of a white cop shooting an unarmed black person, they'd flood facebook with ads urging black americans to ""rise up against white supremacy"" stuff like that.  Anything to make a bad situation worse.  Then once Donald Trump started making pro-Russian comments, the entire focus of the operation switch from ""create chaos"" to ""get Donald Trump elected as President.""  Of course, those objectives aren't mutually exclusive, so they didn't really drop their first objective so much as continue pursuing it in a different way.

But despite all that, I don't think that Russians have anything to do with the trans movement, or at least, they aren't the driving force behind it.  The trans movement is funded by medical corporations first and foremost."

4223,"It does sound Putin-esque doesn't it?: oozing of homophobia, misogyny, and sneaky. It also reminds me of something silly like the CIA would be wont to pull (along with bat-bombs, cat-spies, LSD mind-control studies, etc). I'm just not sure what the CIA would gain from such a move, but who knows? What's definitely certain is that mental health is still in its childhood (we're on the fifth decided-by-committee ""bible"" of 'what is a mental illness, exactly?') and often focuses on drugging people with pharmaceuticals with harsh side-affects over the hard work of actual therapy. 

Then there is the medical profession which has never seen a drug it didn't like, focusing on treatment rather than prevention because it's more profitable. The medical profession loves trans nonsense: hormone blockers, hormone replacements, drugs to deal with the terrible affects of the blockers and replacements, mutilative surgeries such as ""top"" surgeries (read: removing a woman's perfectly healthy breasts) and ""bottom"" surgeries that are so laughably bad that even most trans people don't bother with them. The ""state-of-the-art"" female surgery (I had a chance to look at my friend's binders and pamphlets: he's getting his surgery covered by the state, while my husband can't even get a root canal covered) is blending up a woman's uterus and ovaries and vacuuming them out, and creating a ""phallus"" from thigh skin. The ""state-of-the-art"" male surgery is castration and cutting off one's dick, and then stitching the remnants of the scrotum with some thigh skin to create a ""neo-vagina"" which is just a literal gaping wound that has to be ""stretched"" (read: the body desperately wants to heal, to close that gaping hole, but is prevented from doing that) and is a useless ""hole"" as far as any actual penetration is concerned, has barely any feeling, and is extremely prone to infection, and the surgery, is more often than not, ""unsuccessful"". Kids and young adults are being gaslighted with trans ideology, having their bodies mutilated, and closing the door on normal sexual behavior and relationships forever. Not to mention, this adversely affects gay kids."

4235,"what pisses me off about this is before I was 40yo, whilst my life and career was being totally ruined by my ridiculously heavy constant periods, I wasn't allowed to have a hysterectomy until there was no chance of having kids and early menopause has risks. This was a decade ago. The gynae issues pushed my body so far to it's limits I'm now housebound and was bedbound for a few years, I've lost 7 years of my life to this collapse of my body, my friends, my career, my social life, for a while the ability to read on screen, and the ability to walk.  Yeah it's a comorbid condition but I am pretty damn sure if my gynae issues were under control it would never have got this bad.   


When I asked about hormones the male gynae laughed and said we can't control the dosage well enough to make  difference, the human body is to complicated.And yet if I'd been smart enough to say oh I am in the wrong body I want to be a man, it would have just taken a few counselling sessions and boom. I say smart, that's not what I mean, I think the way surgery is so casually provided and hormone treatment is appalling for future health of these individuals.  I honestly don't believe medical science has moved sufficiently fast in 10 years to change what I was told then.

What's my point? If it's dangerous for me as a hetrosexual woman to have a full hysterectomy at 40, then why isn't it dangerous for far younger women to have 'bottom surgery'?  This is so wrong. It is voluntary FGM. I've been failed and THEY are being failed - for different reasons, but effectively the same procedure."

4238,Can we stop with the oppression Olympics? The worries of bisexual women as expressed above are valid
4239,"This is a GC forum. We are all supposed to respect each other. Stop getting defensive. I'm telling you what it feels like. I am also telling you what I read in response to this topic all the time - why can't they just stick to bisexuals, or why won't bis have sex with them. No one here is saying bisexual people are more oppressed than anyone else, or that lesbians don't have it worse. I am saying woman to woman, it isn't cool to say we will fuck them. The vast majority of us won't. I am telling you this is how I feel, and other bi women as well. That's all."
4240,"Same to you. Bye now, MRA tool."
4241,"That‚Äôs terrible to see how they treated you for a legitimate physical problem vs these people with mental health issues. 

To add that women who know they don‚Äôt want kids are frequently denied sterilization procedures. Yet if they wanted to sterilize themselves in the quest to ‚Äúbecome a man‚Äù it would be okay."
4242,"The easiest way to describe it would be in two ways. One what do we make of racism when there are POC in power who are just as abusive of other POC as the white people in power? Something is missing from our analysis of systemic racism. Similarly, what do we make of women in power who are just as abusive to other women as men in power? Something is missing from our analysis of systemic sexism.

If we follow the logic, especially of the kinds of feminism and anti-racism favored by liberals or capitalists, then it's perfectly fine to be oppressive if you just have a diverse group of oppressors. What's desired is equal access to the upper class not the destruction of oppressive class systems.

Just take a look at recent history: Obama, a black man, happily bombed brown people to oblivion for big oil, military contractors, and national hegemony. Hilary Clinton, a white woman, was more than happy to help. She was also more than happy to take dirty bank money in the form of ""speaking fees"". 

The critical missing piece in many analyses of systemic oppression is the systemic oppression itself. For example, what exactly is the patriarchy? Why does it exist? How does it exist when there are women in power? How does it exist when women are the majority of the population? Sometimes you'll get ""radical"" (to the root) answers, and other times you may get something like an evolutionary biology or historical answer. That's because there are many ways to look at a problem. 

The ultimate issue, a socialist or communist would say, is that feminism isn't compatible with capitalism because capitalism is a system that favors exploitative hierarchies, of which sex has been one of those hierarchies. If feminists want to destroy the root of sexism they have to destroy class-based oppression, not just for themselves, but for everyone. 

According to a socialist/communist, if you keep capitalism, you keep oppressive hierarchies, and feminism accomplishes nothing except make conditions cushy for the women who happen to be sitting at the top, while the women at the bottom suffer."
4243,"No one is saying bisexuals *have* to fuck trans people. /u/MsSinisteress is pointing out that bisexuals are more likely to. Bi and straight women‚Äînot lesbians‚Äîhave the *capacity* to be attracted to TIMs, for example.

That isn‚Äôt to say bisexuals don‚Äôt have preferences. Of course they do. And anyone has the right not to fuck anyone, for any reason."
4244,"But no one's telling anyone that bisexual women should fuck them? Just that, *unlike lesbians,* bisexuals have the *possibility* to be attracted to them - which is as far as I'm concerned is not either forcing bis to have sex with them or ""offering them up to them."""
4245,"it was worse than that. back in the 90s I had private health coverage. but you needed gp to recommend to see a specialist to be covered. My hormones were everywhere, so was the blood, and my gp made me go see a mental health nurse for 6 sessions in return for agreeing to refer me to the private gynaecologist. These days it wouldn't have been allowed.

Said mental health nurse (i'm crap at names but I remember hers) had nothing useful to say, I'd already booked a holiday abroad so couldn't make the last session and I forgot to rearrange it when I got back. Damn woman put on my medical records that I refused to engage and didn't finish the course of treatment and that I put 'very little effort' into it. Thankfully several decades on that's now dropped off my record after one of the many changes of doc when I moved house. But I still am annoyed by it. I don't hold grudges but I have a long memory for that sort of crap.  


And I agree, it's an uneven playing field. In particular with sterilization vs. trans. How is that any different? it's still mental isn't it? wanting to be a man vs. wanting not to have kids. Yeah someone can use the pill rather that sterilisation but a girl can wear a sock in their crotch and invest in some gum arabic and fake hair equally easily. It doesn't make any logical sense that trans is encouraged unless there's money in it somehwere for someone... And it's making money from vulnerable people, and that's against the hippocratic oath."

4248,"Acknowledging heterosexual women as a group are capable of being attracted to men or TIMs isn't equal to forcing them to be with men either. Same with bi women. What's wrong with describing sexual orientations as what they *mean?*

Jesus Christ, you're not being reasonable at the slightest here. But if that's how you define ""offering you to them"" then nobody in GC is doing it, because that's simply acknowledging the definition of the sexual orientation."
4249,"Honestly? Yeah. As a lesbian, I could never watch porn. Even before I knew what feminism was, I'd be disgusted by it and would feel pretty sorry for the women. It actually affected me a lot since I have always been a computer person and whenever you search for ""lesbian"", that's the first thing that comes up.

4283,"No, porn in it's current form is modern and thus not hardwired. 

Before technology, and this includes photograph and print, how DID people manage to get sexually aroused? 

I mean really. Back in prehistoric times, do you think men had to go to another cave and literally watch other people have sex in order to get aroused? No. That's absurd. Hell, not even cave paintings represent sexual acts. That shit didn't come around until historic times, which represent a relatively short period in human history. 

Porn is not in any way necessary for sexual arousal for anyone.

I mean really."
4284,"I don't think there's anything ingrained about porn usage. Just the opposite. Stalk the manosphere. You'll learn that porn is pretty boring, if not off-putting (in an uncanny valley way) to men who have had healthy sex lives for most of their adult lives.

I've heard multiple men describe it by comparing it to sports: ""I can play (my favorite  sport) every day. I can't watch it everyday."" And, as one boyfriend I had observed, ""(watching porn) isn't even like watching sports, because it's not real.""

My current bf, like every good bf I've had, is pretty naive when it comes to porn. He claimed to have seen porn when he was younger, because he had a copy of playboy. That might be because he had sex early, and continued to have sex throughout his life.

Men who post online about how ""every man uses porn"" are a self-selecting sample. They are the sort of men who already are prone to hanging out online. 

I do think we're getting an inverse bell curve though: more men on one end of the spectrum who've never had sex or have had very little sex, who are big consumers of porn. That's probably because people's life patterns are being interrupted by the internet and digital addiction in general. People are having sex later. People are less physically fit and getting less quality sleep."
4285,"The older I get and the more I see, the more I'm inclined to think that exploitation is ingrained in the male sex. I didn't want to believe this when I was young. I was convinced that men were culturally poisoned, that men raised in certain environments would respect women and live peacefully with us. But while some men seem to be capable of that, a huge percentage seem hardwired to subjugate women for labor and exploitation. The porn itself isn't hardwired, but the indifference to female suffering seems to be."

I had just woken up and was in urgent need of caffeine when I posted the comment above.

I think that it also hinders the imagination, which is sad in & of itself."
4313,"True, though I think lust in its natural form (without all of the porn and objectification of women), would be based on more than just the way a woman looks, which again, is so manipulated by porn. It also would be a lot easier to control I think. Like, we can all control the thoughts we have and seeing an attractive person, doesn‚Äôt have to mean ‚ÄúI want to fuck‚Äù, we all control our thoughts up to that point. I think the biology comes more in the way of who we are attracted to (men or women), and that if we see something erotic we can get aroused, just like we can get arouses through touch, sound etc. - but that shouldn‚Äôt have a lot to do with how attractive the person is. And also it definitely shouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with that person being subjected to violence or degradation (like in porn)."
4314,"I don‚Äôt know , sex is a pretty innate drive. Rape has been around for all of human history"
4315,"> Porn is not in any way necessary for sexual arousal for anyone.

I definitely agree. However, it may very well be that pornography ""hijacks"" or overloads an existing behavioral pathway or mechanism with a stimulus that is ""stronger"" than any naturally occurring stimulus would ever be able to become.

You could compare it with how we are biologically programmed to seek out fat, salt and sugar. In our ""natural"" environment, those are all fairly hard to find, and usually only available as a small component mixed in with otherwise healthy or digestion moderating components, like fiber.

Then, all of a sudden, we are able to not only refine it out into, e.g., pure sugar, but also cheaply produce the pure products in huge quantities. Just about any food, no matter how low quality, can then be hugely ""improved"" by artificially adding lots of sugar, fat and salt. The reward circuitry in our brains will just go ga-ga from the overload of stimulus, resulting in addiction-like over consumption of these foods, all while the negative effects of it keep piling up.

Similarly, porn provides more and stronger sexual stimulus than could otherwise reasonably occur, captures the corresponding reward circuitry, and make the addicts prefer it over ""the real thing"".

None of which, of course, absolves the addicts of responsibility for the many negative effects that perpetuating their addiction causes, whether it is alcohol, porn or whatever.

Also, like with most other addictions, the most damage is done to younger, still not fully developed, ""consumers"". The fact that very few seem to care a lot that we have 18-year olds whose only real exposure to anything relating to sex is a decade of excessive porn consumption is truly frightening."

>There's also porn where people (solo or couples) appear to be enthusiastically willing and enjoying themselves. Arousal at seeing someone you find attractive in a sexual context is a normal part of human sexuality. If not, where did it come from?  

Yes, but how do you know this video is being shared with the woman's consent? Stealth porn is one of *the most popular forms of pornography out there* and I would argue the majority of pornography featuring ""consenting"" couples was in fact not uploaded with the woman's consent at all. Why would women consent to having pornography of themselves uploaded to the internet with no monetary compensation? (Ex. YouPorn, PornHub) You could argue voyeurism, but in reality very few women have that fetish and also don't desire to be compensated for it.

TBF, that's obviously not exactly what it said. Maybe this is a better way of explaining how I read it:

Here's the first half...

>I'm not interested in a world where men really want to watch porn, but resist because they've been shamed.

This is fine. I completely agree with this--I don't think shame is healthy. There are much better reasons to avoid porn than shame. There are better reasons to do almost anything than shame.

Here's the second half...

>I'm interested in a world where men are raised from birth with such an unshakable understanding of women as living human beings that they are incapable of being aroused by their exploitation.

This is fine... I completely agree with this part too. The problem is that the two statements are stuck together, strongly implying that the reason men are aroused is because they *don't* understand women are living human beings, and are aroused by their exploitation (not by sexual visuals). That's where it falls apart for me. I don't think that's the actual problem, nor the solution. I don't know anything about Jonah Mix, but it makes it come off as preachy instead of an authentic desire for a better society.

Why not a world where men *don't feel the need for porn* because they have healthy sexuality?"
4355,"I know the insults are rhetorical, but no, I'm not dumb, nor an addict, nor defending porn (in the least). I'm in a healthy relationship. I'm not misquoting--I was trying to help you see how I read the OP, that you apparently didn't see, and still don't see. I get that you're angry, and okay, but you're misdirecting it by taking it out on me. I'm not who you apparently think I am, nor have the opinion/argument that you're projecting onto me.

\[edit\] Re the ""misquoting"" I explained it in a different comment, to a different user, so maybe you believe (with good faith...?) I'm just taking it out of context to put a spin on it.

To clarify... there's absolutely nothing wrong with ""incapable of being aroused by \[women's\] exploitation."" Men shouldn't be aroused by women's exploitation--that's a sickness in psychology and society. The problem is that the OP juxtaposed that next to a general statement about porn, as if the only reason men are aroused by porn is because of women's exploitation. That's a big (and wrong) assumption. The only way to rectify the discrepancy in OP is to either 1) ignore that we're talking about porn in general, and assume we're now talking about porn that porn that appears exploitative (doubt that's the intent), or 2) try to see past the parts about humanity and exploitation, to get the more general view of what OP actually wants in the world.

If I misquoted, it's because the original is so heavily spun, it doesn't even make sense. It's almost like reading the arguments in political tweets."

4360,"That's why south park made sure to make mention of that too (The PC babies are crying because ""Mulan identifies as a man & Disney didn't acknowledge it"".)        

This alone should've been a red flag to their supporters, when they started to trans characters & historical figures, based on clothing. There's countless women that had to dress as men to pursue jobs & relationships they weren't allowed too. To ignore that history is misogynistic AF, sending the message a woman is only a woman if they ""Identify"" with their oppression (basically agreeing with the patriarchy; that women are meant to be a certain way, & if not, they must not be women.)

4363,What! Mulan has to dress in men's clothes because she won't be taken serious as a woman. Was Arya Stark trans too? Same concept. She wore men's clothes so she would be *mistaken* for a man and less likely to be needlessly assaulted.
4364,"Oh no, she was a man. So was Joan of Arc, charged with dressing like a man, but she was a man actually. Hatshepsut whose existence was nearly wiped out after her death because she was a woman, guess what, she was a man too! They're all men. Every girlhood heroine of ours was a man!

I had one just the other day try and tell me you know all those graves and those sexist archaeologists saw swords or whatever and said ""it's a man"" without looking at the skeleton, which are fairly easy to sex if you know what you're looking for, and recently they've found many were women, well actually those were all men too. How weird that true real feminism has found that the sexist men were right and women have always done as they were told. But that's just science!"

&#x200B;

The same thing happened with a character from Assassins Creed. If you're into pirates, you might know of Mary Read. 

&#x200B;

She was dressed as a male because her brother died, and her mother only got support from Mary's grandmother to fund her brother, so Mary was dressed that way until she got older. She went into the navy, blah blah blah. She only ever revealed herself to be female when she got married, her husband died, she went back to male, but then she went into poly with Anne and Thatch, so she didn't feel the need to hide herself anymore.

&#x200B;

A lot of people started claiming she was a ""transgender"" and all the bs, and if you said anything to object it you would be sent hate messages.

But they clearly did no research on her, nor pirates back then, as females would dress as males, and reveal their breasts to show their victims they were killed by a woman. Anne and Mary were known for this."
4368,"*unhinges jaw and lets out angry swarm of bees*  Don't fucking touch my favorite Disney movie!

SHE IS MY PRINCESS FOREVER!"
4369,"This is so fucking gross. Mulan was an inspirational figure to me as a little girl as well. It sucks that modern little girls are being taught that having strength, cutting your hair, and being willing to risk it all for someone you love like Mulan did makes you a ""man on the inside"".

&#x200B;

Also, anyone painting her as trans clearly didn't watch the movie. Mulan never WANTED to join the army or fight in that stupid war. Hell, the movie starts with her willingly putting on her makeup and dress and doing everything she can to impress the matchmaker and find a good husband to honor her family. The ONLY reason she disguises herself as a man and joins the army is because she's terrified of losing her father and would rather risk her own life than let him march off to his death. 

And, when she gets to the army camp, she is so laughably terrible at ""acting like a man"" that she nearly outs herself on multiple occasions and all her fellow soldiers think she's a weirdo. And, in multiple scenes, she complains about how much she HATES living with a bunch of dudes because of how nasty they are. And, after she's outed; she never puts on her male disguise again (even though wearing her female clothes puts her at a disadvantage when she tries to warn people about the Hun attack and no one will listen to her because she's a woman). Literally nothing about her behavior or stated desires in the film indicates that she secretly yearns to be a man.

&#x200B;

But, according to the trans/tumblr cult, Mulan isn't a real woman because a real woman wouldn't have risked her life to save a loved one. A real woman would just put on her nicest dress and cry on the fainting couch while her father was sent to his death."

When Mulan sings ‚Äúbe a man‚Äù she is performing masculinity so that she won‚Äôt be perceived female."
4383,"WTF. Mulan is a WOMAN who only dressed as a man to serve in the army, to spare her crippled father from serving, and dying, at war.  It's pretty clear that she only wore the disguise for that reason. She doesn't show any interest in women (which is pretty clear during the song 'a girl worth fighting for'), and in fact she seems to develop a romantic attraction to the general guy. When he comes back to her home after the war, she's living as a woman and is clearly interested in him. Just because she doesn't submit to traditional cultural roles that women would DOES NOT MAKE HER TRANS.  

I've heard people claim that the girl in National Velvet was trans too, like no, she cut her hair and dressed as a male after they realized the horse only trusted her and would not obey other (male) jockeys, but the horse racing organization only allowed men to compete as jockeys.  Literally children understand these concepts."

Not accepting Mulan as trans would also force us to accept female oppression as something real, and this conflicts with the female privilege of the trans narrative.

The truth always wins in the end and the distorters are always cast aside in the ever forward march of human development."
4413,Oh my God. Did I just agree with some PC bullshit? I don't know what side is up anymore
4414,"Mulan is fantastic for criticizing gender roles all around. The intro is a criticism of societies forcing women and girls into demure and sexualized roles, and the song ""I'll make a man out of you"" is about unrealistic standards of masculinity imposed on boys.
The trans movement, on the other hand, is all about forcing oneself into a strict box based on the artificial gender roles one believes one portrays. Mulan's subtext is entirely antithetical to the trans movement."
4415,"Nobody thinks Mulan is trans outside of fevered headcanons. Mulan is a big deal in trans spaces because the struggles she goes through trying to fake being a man in the army/trying her best to learn how to ""be a man"" resonates with a lot of trans people. Plenty of Trans men use the song ""make a man out of you"" as a way to make themselves feel better when dealing with dysphoria or transphobia.   


It's also because there is so little positive representation of trans people in quality media that people latch onto whatever character or show makes them feel validated. Sailor moon for instance is popular among trans women because it allows them to live the childhood they never really got to live in a way.   


The whole point is finding empowerment. Not rewriting Mulan into being trans."

I have actually seen them call otherwise supportive people selfish for wanting these women to remain women.   it is pretty rich because they throw temper tantrums about people ""misgendering"" them, but it is totally ok for them to misgender women like Joan of Arc or Hatshepsut.....I have never seen them say Marie Curie was trans.....have you actually heard them say that?  Because if so, that is horrifying."

4419,"Wait, isn't it sexist to assume one's gender based on clothing? 

And what's the point of being trans if all you really ever wanted was to reinforce patriarchy after you've transitioned? It's like, okay, my body is now in line with my identity‚Äînow give me my gender roles and stereotypes."

It makes me incredibly angry."
4422,I almost downvoted this because I wouldn't be surprised if TRAs *do* try to rewrite history and portray these brave women as trans men. Makes me incredibly angry to think their bravery and legacies could be rewritten to redefine WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT into trans ideology. Hell no.

4436,Oh hell no! They have gotten to her too!  They probably think all those female pirates were men then.
4437,"It‚Äôs like they ignore the fact that sailors in those days considered women on ships to be bad luck, so it wasn‚Äôt unheard of for women to cross-dress so they could get on board ships and not cause a ruckus.

4439,I loved Mulan too..Also she was totally feminine!  She didn't even relate to the men and didn't fit in at all!  She was just uncomfortable being forced into a marraige...a lot of the other women were probably too!
4440,Making her trans makes the movie and original story too boring as all hell.  It was interesting BECAUSE she was a woman trying to save her dad and she acted heroically.  It was very non cliched and a beautiful story.  Trying to make her a dude makes the story stupid.
4441,She was also the only doll without high heeled feet. They were even proportionate.
4442,"These are the same people that complain about cultural appropriation too!! How is Mulan is totally trans, not culture appropriation.  You are right, it is disrespectful."
4443,"If her culture states that performing is a man's job and she does it anyway, that means she's really a man on the inside. After all, if she were a REAL woman, engaging in any stereotypically/culturally male behavior would cause her to catch dysphoria and throw herself off a bridge in despair!!!"

4464,I saw a TIM claim Joan of Arc was literally male. The theory was because she didn‚Äôt menstruate that somehow meant she was a man with an intersex condition. So he claimed her as a fellow TIM.
4465,"I remember that. Frankly nothing makes me more angry than people who look at historical women who were *forced to conceal their sex to follow their callings or just to live unaccosted* and then concluding ""she must've been transgender!"" despite literally no other evidence.

4470,"It goes beyond just gender with these narratives they create from a historical figue. They are looking to for distinct rolemodels. 

Outside of being a man, they believe she was also an atheist. 

They want to create a character that shares similar views with many trans people. Give them something to identify with. 

Joan of Arc was a Catholic. A devout Catholic throughout her entire life."
4471,"But why even entertain these fools?
Applying some crazy nonsensical 21st century ideology to 15th century France is so dumb and shows these idiots know absolutely nothing about the topic. I am not even sure they are able to live without forgetting to breathe.
Responding to them imo gives their insane claim legitimacy. 
Also Jeanne d‚ÄôArc DID wear male clothing and that‚Äôs one of the reasons she was convicted of heresy.
I don‚Äôt understand why you are even saying this. She did wear male clothing and once she finally ¬´¬†admitted¬†¬ª her heresy (after being forced to) she was forbidden to wear it ever again. And then she was returned to prison and surprise! could only find male clothing (a trick by the English) and in order to avoid getting raped she was forced to wear it again. Therefore she was considered relaps which means she went back to heresy and the result is automatically death.
Which is what the English wanted all along: to burn her. Not for her to spend her lifetime in prison, which was the original sentence.

Women weren‚Äôt exactly allowed to be warriors at the time: just because a few women did choose that profession (Jeanne des Armoises for instance) doesn‚Äôt mean it was totes cool. It wasn‚Äôt.
Jeanne d‚ÄôArc was an exception and it was stressed that she did it to save the kingdom and because God had chosen her. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be a normal thing for a woman to be in an armour and be around men (especially since she wasn‚Äôt married) but she was a virgin and the situation was desperate.
Besides, at the beginning Jeanne was just a mascot. 

I get that you want to defend Jeanne d‚ÄôArc but a lot of what you say isn‚Äôt super accurate."
4472,"Nope, no conundrum here. Rewriting women's history is unacceptable, full stop."
4473,"You are the sex you are born as.

4476,So important that they appropriate women‚Äôs history for their own enjoyment.
4477,"I agree, trans people should have people to look up to for inspiration. But they should look up to actual trans people, not women who weren't trans. 

Unfortunately the historical figures for these two disparate groups are the same people.

No, they're not. None of the people mentioned in this thread were trans. A woman is not trans because she takes on a traditionally male role, since whether a role is traditionally masculine or feminine is a social construct, not what determines your gender. 

Most people who work on oil rigs are men. But there are some women who do that job. They're not trans men, they're just women who work on an oil rig."
4478,"I guess Brienne, Yara,  Ripley, Sarah Conner, Samantha Carter, Xena, Gabrielle, All the female characters on Firefly and even Megan Foxes character in the first transformers was trans!"
4479,Aw fuck
4480,Not only that but said woman has to be super fiesty and say shit like women can do anything men can and wants to fight just to prove herself!  Once she breaks a nail she realizes she really does just want to have babies.
4481,"Which is gross.  Yoren cut her hair to hide her among the boys heading for the Wall so she could pass by soldiers unnoticed and so the boys and men heading for the wall wouldn‚Äôt rape her or kill her.  It‚Äôs a means of survival for a young girl on her own in a harsh world. Arya‚Äôs tomboyishness is also a direct response to the performative femininity of her mother, Catelyn, and her older sister, Sansa.  She also looks up to her brothers Robb and Jon Snow.

I mean, are they going to argue that Varys and the Unsullied are ‚Äúwomen‚Äù because they‚Äôre eunuchs?"
4482,"Hiding so you don't get raped and later decapitated or get raped and impregnated to secure male claims to royalry isn't a trans thing. It's a thing a woman would think of to avoid brutality of men in power ffs.

I can prove this too via the simple fact that men don't rape men to impregnate them"
4483,"Except... women can be anything they want! Don't you know what a *curve* is? It's not that you can't be a woman if you're not those things, it's just that *most* women are strippers, housewives, and escorts. If you don't want to be those things, you're still a woman, you're just a bit... unusual for your gender."
4484,"Oh hell yeah. They see any type of character hiding their real sex for a purpose they will automatically call them ""transgender"" and worship them as such. 

&#x200B;

All the other pirates are okay. Only Mary was given the ""omg she's dressed as a male she's a transgender icon"". She's a lot like Mulan in a sense, just from Britain. There should be a #SaveMaryRead tag."
4485,As they were dying Mary would pull out her breasts. Aka something a male pirate did not want to see.
4486,"It also makes sense where in a world where being a man is a higher class, that some people would try to obtain that privilege."
4487,"It would also destroy the ending. The original movie's ending was a beautiful scene where the father breaks down and cries because he's so proud to have her for a daughter and so grateful she survived the war. And Mulan's commander and fellow soldiers learn to respect her as a woman and challenge some of their sexist views.

In the trans version, the ending would go something like this:

\-Dad: *""It sure is a relief that you had a male soul all along, Mulan! If I had a weak, worthless cis daughter instead of a strong trans son, I'd be FUCKED!""*

\-Shang: *""It's great that you're trans, Mulan. For a minute, I was afraid that my patriarchal beliefs about women being inferior & weak were going to be challenged and I'd have to start treating women like equal human beings! But now I know that you only succeeded in the military because of your superior male brain! So nothing has to change!!""*"
4488,not to mention she doesn't enjoy being disrespected. She's at least NB.
4489,Ughhhhhh.  Hillary wears pantsuits because that‚Äôs dress code for working on the Hill.  Which is inherently misogynistic but better than it used to be when they had to wear skirts.
4490,Good. Unfortunately she will probably just get mad and defensive....but we need to keep speaking out about this.  What gives them the right to try to force their ideology in other people's lives and stories?

4492,They already did. Sigh.
4493,"I think what they mean is that after her father was saved, she didn't continue to disguise herself as a man since there was no longer a need to."
4494,"True. I more meant that if they were honest they would see no shit she was a woman.  I mean, if she was such a man why did she not keep that identity forever?  They just see what they want to see."
4495,I'm starting to suspect this as well. Education of women's history is non existent.
4496,That's true. I told one of my adult classes that women's public restrooms had to be lobbied for. I asked them if they knew why. They frowned in confusion. I had to explain that many men didn't want women to have any sort of public life away from the home. Some men knocked the female restrooms down with their carriages in anger. They had no prior knowledge about this.
4497,"I love this shutdown. No. Just no. 

Snape is an asshole but a very complex one and sure, his reasons to save Lily could be seen as selfish, he did eventually try and save Harry. He stood inbetween the trio and a werewolf...And he is a man clearly. A really well written one by Rowling. Say what you want about her current weird (imo non canon) add ons but the book characters are well formed, whether evil or good or inbetween of both genders which is refreshing, honestly."
4498,"Of course he was, that's how Rowling wrote him.   

But if we're going to retroactively ""trans"" any character, a character with no adult romantic attachments, a divided identity that made him suspect to all sides, constantly keeping his real self hidden within layers of disguises would be a solid pick.  

Also helps if their setting is fantasy or sci-fi, so we can wave off questions of whether ""man/woman in a female/male body"" is a real thing.  

(Claremont planned for Mystique to be Rogue's father, but that doesn't count)"
4499,You're not wrong.
4500,">Conforming to gender roles...

Exactly. I mean conforming to them because it appeals to you, thats great. But conforming to them because you believe that this is the only way to be 'a real woman/man' is very sexist."
4501,"lol. wasn't she also a teenager? Women had menarche later back then. Also chronically not having enough to eat and/ or frequent exercise, resulting in low body fat percentages can stop the menstrual cycle. Did these people not learn that in high school sex ed? XD"
4502,"I should add that this testimony come from her male bursar and squire, Jean d'Aulon, who was 22 years older than her. I doubt she would openly speak about her menstruations to him especially when he called them ""the secret illness of women"". It's even more doubtful after all the inspections she endured. All confirmed she was a virgin with absolutely normal genitalia.

It's even more disrespectful to claim she was secretly a man, since her conviction was about her femininity. She was literally burned at stake for being a woman."
4503,"Yes, it has. There was a nosedive when it stopped being perceived as a pencil-pushing job and became a more respectable position. As the demand for programming surged, the women were pushed aside for male applicants. plus all the earliest home computers were all marketed to men in pop magazines (along with video games). So we saw these two budding interests become gendered practically overnight. 

I think it's interesting because it provides us insight into how gender imbalance and sexist ideas about capability begin. The older generation that saw this shift and were more aware of early female involvement were less likely to believe in sexist ideas than the younger cohort who simply observed the imbalance and made snap judgments like ""men are better at programming than women"". They observed AND THEN tthey justified their observations."
4504,"It has. I work for a consultancy, which in practice means I work on several projects a year with high profile tech clients. Every single time I go onsite to meet a new client, without fail there are almost exclusively men in engineering. Row after row, floor after floor. The one good thing about an open office is it makes spotting that really easy. 

What‚Äôs sad is that many of these companies participate in ‚Äúdiversity hiring‚Äù, and host events exclusively for women. I think that‚Äôs great, and more women are needed in all departments for these companies, but the majority of attendees are not software engineers. I honestly believe there are not enough female software engineers to begin with that diversity hiring doesn‚Äôt do anything to correct the root of the problem. We need to be teach girls and young women that math and science aren‚Äôt ‚Äúuncool‚Äù, and excelling at those subjects is a good thing. To me, it feels like some sort of unspoken taboo that a girl should not want to grow up to work in a STEM discipline, and _that‚Äôs_ what really needs to change."
4505,Bingo.  They don't want to do any of that pesky work like write their own stuff or create there own spaces.   They love stuff like head canon-fictional or non fictional-where they pretend that other people or other people creations were really transgender.
4506,"Oh, absolutely. I wish people would just let the poor child rest. She wasn‚Äôt a Mormon and she wasn‚Äôt a closeted transman, she was a CHILD."
4507,"Well, obviously."
4508,How is it that there aren't heaps of historical men being redefined as transwomen? I only ever see it as women being redefined as trans men. It's almost as if there is some socio-cultural reason why women have historically presented as male in order to enter certain spheres or be independent. What could it be?
4509,"Yeah. What I find odd is that these are all women being posthumously and ahistorically transed, presumably by transmen. Who are women. So their disdain for being female is SO profound that they happily refigure these amazing non-conformist risk taking women as trans, because they're projecting their own ideas about themselves on to them.  


But then again IS it transmen who are doing it? After all the person who  insists Kurt Cobain was a trans woman (uh, no seriously NO, he might today have decided to be NB at best) is female, no?"
4510,"Of course they're not. But the women being touted as trans men of history are most of our role models.

Once again women are expected to.give up what they have to support other groups while men get a free pass.

Apparently it's more important that we do because of our history of.being oppressed or something. The line goes that we should be fighting harder for others because we once - oh so long ago, it's all over now - experienced oppression. It infuriates me."
4511,Xena and Gabriel wore skirts?
4512,That's exactly how they argue it.
4513,Right...and those are women with more masculine  brains!
4514,Got it!
4515,Well fucking said.
4516,I read in an article that the new live action Mulan might be transgender in the new adaption and I hope that was a joke because what you wrote is so true...Mulan was such a beautiful story of courage and family and these people just want to ruin everything by having her really be a man after all! They don't care that having her be a man it would mean that the society was right to force girls into marraige and having their honor be bearing sons.  They don't care that the movie was ACTUALLY empowering to girls...

While we had outdated and beat up textbooks, we also had an _awfully_ nice football stadium. üôÑ"
4520,">Grace Hopper

Ada Lovelace too!

I remember the debate in the 80's about girls in math and science (predated ""STEM"" as a term), with the influence of that ""Bicameral"" split brain crap still in the air, I heard women=language ability (soft) and men=technical or math ability.  Thing is, the brain is (in certain areas) divided and math and language come from the same side.  Either both are ""male"" or both are ""female""  (or neither). No split. We knew that then."
4521,"As someone who wanted to be an engineer and was pushed into arts and literature, I partly agree with you. I've heard people say what you said that girls need to learn that math and science aren't nerdy or uncool, but I'm not sure that is the main problem. 

A big problem I see that is very difficult to correct is informal learning environments, for instance boys who program hang around with other boys who program. By the time you get to a college environment, they have more experience and it can be discouraging. When I was in high school, most of my friends were interested in the arts and literature. We spent our spare time writing and reading poetry, drawing and similar things. By the time I got to college, I had a pretty developed skill set in those areas and a lot of confidence. In many STEM subjects I felt inadequate, not in terms of raw ability but in terms of acquired knowledge.

It was later in life that I went back to school and took some of the math classes I didn't have the time in my schedule to take when I was an undergraduate. When I learned to program it was in a summer session that was directed at career changers and about half the class was women, so the interest is there.

Trying to do things to counter act those informal learning environments could be helpful. It may not be a coincidence that the percentage of women in CS started declining shortly after the introduction of the desktop personal computer.

Of course, a lot of my experience is decades old and since I never had children I haven't kept up on what young people do. My step daughter is studying engineering, but I've never talked to her about how she decided that. I know my husband encouraged her interest in that a lot. 

I'd be very curious to interview college age women who did well on the math section of the college entrance exam but did not go into a stem field and find out why not. It's possible we could get answers we don't even anticipate.

I have some other thoughts on that subject, but I don't want to bore you."
4522,"Well, not quite the same, but I've seen claims that Kurt Cobain was a trans woman, because he wrote dresses on stage sometimes."
4523,"Yeah, you are right.  They would be non binary femmes! /s"
4524,"Yeah, it's like this overgeneralization of women doesn't impede your individual choices, YOU can still be a renowned scientist, why do you care what your category is defined as?

Except it does matter."
4525,"Indeed. It always hurts me, as a very tomboish woman its hurtful to know that they dont consider me 'a real woman'."
4526,"I absolutely agree that informal learning environments discourage female participation from a young age, and in my personal experience that doesn‚Äôt change as one gets older. I think this is another puzzle piece that explains why more women don‚Äôt choose to work in STEM. 

Another piece is that once women do start in these fields, the environments in which we work are overly competitive and aggressive. I think about that quite a bit. I‚Äôm established in my career and refuse be forced out, but I also can really empathize with the women who choose to leave the industry. It‚Äôs not the outright harassment that wears me down as much as the constant and overwhelming soft sexism. 

I made the choice awhile back that I will no longer work for an organization run by a man. I know this position comes from a place of privilege though, and women with less established careers most likely can not afford to make the same decision as it severely restricts one‚Äôs employment opportunities. 

I‚Äôd really enjoy hearing your other thoughts on this. I don‚Äôt find your thoughts boring at all :)"
4527,"Yeah, half the men in rock in the 90s were transwomen,

I've seen that from one person, widely shared, and it looks very fanficcy.

I do believe in transpeople and support their human rights, I just hate this stuff. It's like Mormons posthumously baptising everyone."

This is infuriating. They aren't policing *gender* at all... they are enforcing the divisions around sex in sport. Has this person ever been to a women's sporting event? There is almost always a disproportionate number of gender non-conforming women in sport.... wtf? 

THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GENDER."
4534,"Re the need for ""invasive"" and ""prying"" testing to determine or prove a student's sex in order to figure out which sports teams they should be on: I don't get the objection to this because in order to enroll children in schools in the USA initially, parents or guardians customarily need to provide the kids' birth certificates, which all show their sex.

Every year, US students are also routinely required to get an annual checkup with a doctor, then hand in to the school a health form that the medical professional has filled out and signed. All children's principal HCPs already know the children's sex! Yes, this is true even of school-age kids with DSDs.

What's more, when children and teens get involved in competitive athletics, they're usually required to provide proof in writing that a physician has cleared them for participation in those specific sports activities. Also, it's always been standard operating procedure in school sports that males all must be checked out at least once a year for groin hernias.

Finally, the oft-heard argument that ""no one knows their sex chromosomes"" and finding out is difficult,  expensive and onerous has little leg to stand on nowadays because the reality is, inexpensive genetic testing will soon be so common that most people will know their genetics, and they'll have medical records on file to back it up.  Inexpensive and non-invasive tests of fetal chromosomes known as NIPTs are now routine in much of the world. These tests can accurately identify the sex of a fetus at 8-9 weeks from blood drawn from the mother's arm in the customary fashion (hence the huge and worrying rise in sex-selective abortion of female fetuses in many countries).  The NIPT already is a standard part of pre-natal medical care for pregnant women who use the NHS in the UK,  and it's customary for the vast majority of pregnant women who get decent pre-natal medical care in countries like the US, too.  (Even back when I had kids in the 1990s, pre-natal genetic testing through amnio and CVS was already available and commonly used in the US. Unbeknownst to them, many of the trans-identified youngsters in school today had their chromosomes tested when they were still in utero.)

Pre-natal testing aside, it's also the law in nearly every USA state that a small amount of blood be drawn from the foot of every newborn at birth so that genetic tests can be run for a number of specific inherited diseases. (The list of diseases checked varies from state to state.) Since some of the diseases tested for are sex-linked, determining sex chromosomes is part and parcel of the testing process. Which means ""checking chromosomes"" is no longer a big deal because it's already a done deal."
4535,"Full text:

The Arizona House of Representatives passed a ban on transgender students participating in girls‚Äô sports, a measure its sponsor argued is common sense but which opponents contended would allow for discrimination against young athletes.

The emotional hours-long debate on House Bill 2706 culminated in a party-line vote of 31-29, sending the measure to the state Senate, where it will become another flashpoint in the culture wars at the state Capitol.

Rep. Nancy Barto, a Phoenix Republican who is sponsoring the measure, argued it is necessary in the face of a lawsuit in Connecticut brought by the conservative Scottsdale-based group Alliance Defending Freedom and students who argue they unfairly lost out in competition with transgender athletes.

Barto could not cite any such cases in Arizona of students missing out on scholarships or titles, but conservative groups have pushed similar laws across the country this year.

HB 2706 would require interscholastic and intramural leagues to designate sports as co-educational, male or female based on what the law terms ""biological sex."" Teams or sports designated as ""female"" would be closed ""to students of the male sex.""

The law would apply at both public and private schools, including community colleges and universities.

If in dispute, an athlete could establish their sex through a genetic test.

Initially, Barto's bill called for students to meet three different requirements. They would have needed to get a sworn doctor's statement detailing their student's genetic makeup, ""internal and external reproductive anatomy"" and ""normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone.""

Democrats decried the bill as invasive and harmful to transgender students.

State Rep. Daniel Hernandez, D-Tucson, called it the ""show me your genitals law"" ‚Äî a play on the nickname for Senate Bill 1070, the controversial ""show me your papers"" law from 2010.

In turn, Barto amended the bill, scaling it back to only require a genetic test.

Barto argued the bill sets firm rules when it comes to gender in competitive sports, particularly when there are titles and big scholarships on the line.

""Shot puts are heavier for boys. Girls' basketballs are smaller. It makes a difference,"" she said.

Democrats: 'We're policing gender'

Still, Democrats argued the measure amounts to an overreach by the state government into something better left to students, schools and families.

‚ÄúWe're policing gender,‚Äù said Minority Leader Charlene Fernandez, D-Yuma. ‚ÄúWe're trying to decide if that person is feminine enough or not feminine enough and we're using that to justify subjecting our transgender athletes to additional barriers to participating in sports.‚Äù

Democrats also argued that the bill is too broad, contending it would allow spiteful competitors and bitter athletic rivals to file complaints and launch investigations into students on opposing teams.

Who, exactly, will be responsible for handling the results of genetic tests was another question raised by Democrats. Will it be the schools, the athletics leagues or the state government?

Hernandez noted that the Arizona Interscholastic Association, which governs school athletics throughout the state, has already adopted policies for screening transgender athletes to compete.

The organization requires that students compile letters of support from parents, a school administrator and a qualified health professional. The student must then get approval from a committee as well as the association's executive board.

Democrats said 10 athletes are competing under the policy and that the AIA had rejected some applicants, suggesting the process is not just a rubber stamp.

Barto told lawmakers she had not talked with the organization about her bill.

More than 200 local and national businesses signed a letter in recent weeks opposing HB 2706, including the Arizona Diamondbacks as well as the tech companies PayPal and Uber.

‚ÄúThe pursuit of divisive policies that are not based on evidence or need puts our collective economic success at risk,‚Äù the letter stated. ‚ÄúThis bill would create a dangerous situation for Arizona‚Äôs kids, and put our team members who have LGBTQ children in a terrible position, causing them to worry about their kids‚Äô safety, wellbeing, and inclusion at school and in the community.‚Äù

The conservative group Center for Arizona Policy cheered the vote, though, and looked to the Senate. 

‚ÄúArizona senators who support girls and women can boldly support HB2706, which contrary to claims, does not prohibit any student from playing sports. It simply determines on which team a student will play,‚Äù Cathi Herrod, the group‚Äôs president, said in a statement.

'This is a pro-woman bill'

The bill consumed most of the House‚Äôs workday, with debate dragging on for more than five hours.

Lawmakers talked about their own experiences playing sports, with Republicans talking about the bill as a bid to save girls‚Äô sports from male athletes and Democrats arguing that transgender girls deserve to be treated as girls.

Two doctors in the chamber ‚Äî Democratic Rep. Randy Friese and Republican Rep. Regina Cobb ‚Äî offered dueling views about the medical science of gender.

‚ÄúWe tried so hard to not talk about the differences between men and women here in this conversation,‚Äù Barto said as a final vote neared around 8 p.m., after hours of discussion and procedural wrangling.

‚ÄúWe tried to make it very emotional, like we‚Äôre going after a group. But, no, this is a pro-woman bill. This is a bill to save women‚Äôs sports because, frankly, it won‚Äôt be saved if we don‚Äôt clarify the law.‚Äù

House Speaker Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, accused the bill‚Äôs opponents of leaning on intimidation and political correctness.

Directing his comments to girls competing in sports, he said: ‚ÄúYou're not a homophobe. You're not a transphobe. You're a competitor and you should be on a fair field.‚Äù

GOP won't hear anti-discrimination bill

Immediately after the bill passed, Hernandez moved for the House to take up a bill that would bar employers and landlords from discriminating against LGBTQ employees and tenants and extend the state‚Äôs civil rights protections to gay and lesbian Arizonans in other areas, too.

The bill, HB 2716, has not received a hearing, signaling it is not going anywhere at the Republican-controlled Legislature.

Hernandez argued that if lawmakers were serious when they insisted Barto‚Äôs bill was not discriminatory, they should pass an anti-discrimination law.

‚ÄúA bill that would have protected an entire community won't even be debated,‚Äù Hernandez argued as lawmakers gathered their belongings and paced around with their briefcases, preparing to go home.

The House blocked the procedural move on a party line vote."

4537,"It's bittersweet. We got the outcome we wanted, but Republicans didn't do this becuase understand gender and all its problems or how men use it to control women.  And every time a law gets passed by Republicans that happens to align with radfem goals, it helps further the narrative that radfems are all traditional conservatives that hate trans people because they are different. 

It really sucks because radfems don't agree with libfems or conservatives on gender. Libfems believe that your sex shouldn't dictate your gender, but you still have to pick a gender. Conservatives believe gender is dictated by sex. While radfems understand that sex shouldn't dictate who you are, and genders are just sets of norms and stereotypes that confine people and perpetuate sexism and misogyny."

There is no denying the genetic advantages for those born male, especially the ones who have gone through male puberty. Allowing transgender athletes to participate in female sports is incredibly unfair to girls and women. The transgender athletes need to play on the team with their biological sex or a co-ed team. 

I am a little torn on whether or not biological males who take puberty blockers have a genetic advantage over biological females. I think there needs to be more research done. But from what I've seen, testosterone has huge affects on the body and brain even before puberty. So for now, I think this law was necessary and fair."

Something interesting I learned this week is that HCG levels in early pregnancy (\~3 weeks in!) can indicate sex:  [https://consumer.healthday.com/women-s-health-information-34/misc-hormones-health-news-390/blood-may-reveal-baby-s-gender-early-in-pregnancy-505744.html](https://consumer.healthday.com/women-s-health-information-34/misc-hormones-health-news-390/blood-may-reveal-baby-s-gender-early-in-pregnancy-505744.html)

>Earlier research showed a woman's HCG concentration is higher when she's carrying a female fetus than it is when her baby is a boy, and this difference appears late in the first trimester. Some scientists have proposed the split occurs because male fetuses start suppressing maternal HCG.  
>  
>In the new work, Dr. Yuval Yaron, of Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv, and his colleagues sought to learn how soon after fertilization they could detect maternal HCG's link to gender. The researchers collected blood from 335 women (who had a total of 347 pregnancies) undergoing fertility treatments and analyzed samples from the subjects who went on to have a successful singleton delivery. Of those babies, 184 were girls and 163 were boys.

>Yaron's group measured HCG levels between days 14 and 20 after fertilization, and found they could detect more of the hormone in the pregnancies that turned out to be female, starting on the 16th day.

Its kinda a moot point since, from what I've read, its extremely discouraged and/or not allowed because there's significant complications and risks (like lifelong health problems).

Since transitioning is a niche option it will be held at luxury prices like breast and butt implants and Botox.

4623,"During the AIDS crisis in the 1980s and early 1990s, gay men in countries such as the US looked upon big pharma as a hostile force - as basically the enemy. This view was reinforced by the fact that so many of the drugs initially released to treat HIV-AIDS were both highly toxic and ineffective. 

Then in 1996, big pharma finally came up with a combination of drugs that worked to tamp down the HIV virus - and suddenly HIV changed from being a surefire death sentence to a manageable medical condition that people could live with for years, decades even - as long as they kept taking the drugs, that is. 

As a result, gay men in many of the better off countries in the world started seeing big pharma as being on their side rather than as the evil enemy.  And many men infected with HIV felt so grateful to be spared certain death that they didn't really mind that they had a new status as patients who'd be dependent on big pharma for the rest of their lives. All the while, the execs and shareholders of pharmaceutical companies kept hearing what sounded like sweet music to their ears: *ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.*

Meanwhile, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, gay pride, gay rights orgs and the gay rights movement more generally were becoming increasingly corporatized year by year. Leading the pack in backing the new behemoth that came to be known as the ""LGBT"" and ""rainbow mafia"" were the pharmaceutical companies, many of which added gay men who'd been active in the fight against HIV-AIDS to their boards of trustees and hired them as longterm paid advisors.

But what really cemented gay men's new affinity and fondness for big pharma was the introduction in 2012 of the PrEP drugs that allowed people infected with HIV to have unprotected sex without running the risk of passing it on to their partners. Suddenly, all the lessons of the 80s that had led gay men to reflect on their profligate sexual behaviors and to practice ""safe sex"" were thrown out the window. PrEP meant gay guys could fuck each other with abandon and in great numbers just as they had in the 1970s and early 80s - without risking HIV! Whoo hoo. Ever since then, the male gay rights movement has shown enormous loyalty to big pharma. 

In the ensuing years, the proverbial band has continued to play on - *ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching -* though not in the way Randy Shilts meant when he wrote his landmark book about the AIDS crisis, first published in 1987.  Instead of callously ignoring gay men and considering them inconsequential as in the early years of the epidemic, big pharma came to see gay men as a huge pool of potentially lifelong customers who earn the pharma companies big bucks.

The next logical step in the 21st century was for big pharma to expand from the one corner of the lucrative ""LGBT"" market populated by gay men with HIV to the much bigger - and even more lucrative, *fancy that!*  \- population occupied by an ever-expanding number of trans-identified adults and kids.  Get adults to regularly take spiro, estrogen and testosterone in order to bolster their newly-invented gender identities, the reasoning went, and they'll be dependent on these drugs and the rest of the medical industry for life. *Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching...*

But the real goldmine for big pharma was the kids. Convince enough doctors, therapists and parents that everyone has a ""gender identity"" and that some perhaps many young kids are trans, and suddenly big pharma had a whole new pipeline of lifelong drug consumers who'd be dependent on big pharma's costly potions from age 10 or so to the grave. In the process, big pharma in the early 2000s decided to create a brand new but untapped and potentially burgeoning market for one of its crappiest, most toxic inventions of all time - the class of drugs known as GnRH agonists, which were now rebranded as child-friendly ""puberty blockers."" The market these drugs were originally devised for - terminally-ill elderly men with prostate cancer - found the ""side effects"" to be so horrible that most men who tried them didn't want to continue, even if so doing might've delayed their deaths. But kids and their naive parents, especially those who believed all ""trans kids"" become suicidal if not immediately medicated, were another story. So the new myth of ""harmless"" and ""reversible"" puberty blockers that acted merely as a ""pause button"" was created... and people like Norman Spack, MD, Diane Eherenshaft, and Jeanette Jennings, mother of trans poster child Jazz, all lined up willingly to do their part... *Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.*"
4624,"I can kinda see why they got lumped in together, but it definitely wasn't a good decision for either group. Gay and lesbian people aren't doing anything that violates the rights of other people. They just want to live and let live. Trans activists, on the other hand, ARE doing things that violate the rights of other people."
4625,I don't think this would be permitted as they would fall foul of drug testing rules.
4626,"no, the ruling would have any student whose sex is question submit to a genetic test, so that they could be placed on the sports team of their sex. there will be no loopholes when a genetic test is being relied on."
4627,"It said that the women needed to have normal hormone levels so no! From my understanding trans men either have to compete as men, or be off hormones long enough that their bodies normalize in their natural hormone production (possibly a year in my own exp) to possibly be able to compete as their natal sex. So, trans men either have to detransition or play in men‚Äôs sports. That‚Äôs logic to me, but trans women that don‚Äôt transition before puberty, which is common and all of the trans women‚Äôs known athlete‚Äôs current situation, it‚Äôs just unfair for trans women to compete alongside women. Bone structure is huge for sports.

As a detrans woman I think this is one of the most perfect solutions they could think of, it sounds very fair to me but I could be wrong? Someone please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. This is my favourite community so I want to learn ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4628,it doesn't say either way.
4629,"Yes, minors can change their sex designation without parental consent. The parent/guardian is only required to be notified."
4630,"I wasn't in the states but I've never even heard of something like an 'annual school physical.' I would have assumed something like that would be illegal, honestly."
4631,"It is crazy how no one notices that ""trans men"" are completely overlooked.  Even the phrase TERF means you are ignoring TIF."
4632,"They'd refused to say they were on hormones for ~privacy~ but after the ACLU took their case they then disclosed in court documents that they were. I don't think it makes that much difference TBH, they have already young men's bodies with the innate physical advantages that can't be waved away by a birth control pill and some diuretic. Same as McKinnon, Mouncey and other TIMs."
4633,I believe they're on hormones. Hormones don't make men significantly less muscular or 'masculine' looking lmao. In many cases they slightly decrease strength and muscle mass but studies done so far have shown it's often not a significant decrease.
4634,"I actually think he is a bit taller than that, and is more like 6'3"".  But still, point being that he clearly has a male skeleton, and it's not just his height.  His cranium gives away his male frame.  If you compare him to Gwendoline Christie (also 6'3""), then the difference in massive.  Gwendoline clearly has a female skeleton and cranium despite her height.  

I dunno, maybe Nikkie had the genes to be a 6'8"" or 6'9"" man and puberty blockers took him down 6 inches, but I doubt it.  I would be interested to see his mother and father's height, as well as the height of any siblings.  

Anyway, my thinking is that puberty blockers don't really stop the masculinization of the skeleton and cranium.  If it did, Nikkie would not have needed any plastic surgery (he has clearly had a ton), and he would also not have to be a ""fat woman"" to try and cover up the fact that he still has a man's skeletal structure."
4635,He hides it all really well when he is alone in a YouTube video with good lighting.  Find a candid photo of him with real women - it's patently obvious.
4636,"Yep, if my son was trans would be fine with it as long as he gets he's trans, not female and doesn't force himself on females. If he went whole hog and passed , no penis, etc. would still say fine, but stick to only rec sports with levels and still respect female boundaries."
4637,"A fact that never gets mentioned in all the focus on puberty blockers and male puberty is that soon after birth, male infants produce a surge of testosterone (from their testes) so huge that it gives them T levels that are the same as pubertal levels. This ""first male puberty"" usually lasts several months, then by six months the baby boys' T decreases again and remains low until real puberty starts."
4638,Unless it somehow stops at the neck and they get a ladybrain. /s
4639,"Your anecdotal experience is in line with scientific consensus, yes."
4640,"Imagine eventually that's the point, so many trans people, self ID or otherwise, handmaidens, ""queer"" that they just have a lot more power than anyone else in both parties."
4641,"The elite love identity politics, because it destroys solidarity. Why do you think there have been no truly effective leftist movements since Occupy (and yes, that includes the Sanders campaign)? Why do you think Occupy fell apart in the first place?"
4642,"They wanted to kill it. If it‚Äôs for women they will either colonise or destroy it, they don‚Äôt care which."
4643,"But Biden has been gung-ho pro-trans even longer, and his backing of TRAs and child transition goes much deeper through his personal relationship with TIM Sarah McBride (whom Biden considers an honorary member of his family) and the Biden Foundation, which has long funded a lot of trans projects.  The first time I know of that Biden publicly made the claim that ""trans rights are the civil rights issue of our time"" was in 2015 when he and Hillary Clinton gave groveling and ladydick-pandering ""dueling speeches"" at the Scrotum Rights Campaign.

Oops, I meant *Human* Rights Campaign. No idea how *human* became *scrotum*. /s

Yep, they medicalize normal functional human phases and issues and then sell the ""fix"" and they're medicalizing common adolescent gender role confusion. The question is why are people going along with drugging and mutilating their own babies, are they that desperate to join the LGBT crowd out of alienation from other identifying affiliations or just bored with their lives."

4652,"It started back in the 70s and 80s and pertained to a very small group of people that participated in LGB areas. (For example, a huge number of trans people were previously just listed as cross dressers and Drag Queens, very few actually had the title of ‚Äòtransvestite‚Äô which was the term of use back then). But since then it‚Äôs grown into a much larger issue. There‚Äôs a whole group of us who don‚Äôt think sexual orientation has anything to do with gender identity. (r/lgbdropthet)"
4653,[removed]
4654,"We would hope. But that hasn‚Äôt stopped them before, like that wrestler Mack Beggs"
4655,"I think my word use confused you. They‚Äôre genetically female. When I said trans men, I didn‚Äôt mean TIM. TIM take estrogen, not testosterone."
4656,"That makes a lot more sense. As long as the levels deemed normal don‚Äôt prevent female athletes who are not taking/never have taken any sort of testosterone supplement from competing. 

It‚Äôs as fair as you can get competition wise without the creation of a separate Trans section which the general trans community rejects outright."
4657,"Minors being able to change the sex on their *birth certificates*? Wow. These kids are being taught it's perfectly fine - celebrated even - to lie about essential facts of life, and to alter official government documents cuz feelz. Sheesh. This is just setting them up to grow up to be liars, gaslighters, con artists, card sharks, pool hall hustlers, cheats and scofflaws who feel no compunction about dishonesty at all. Many will probably end up becoming tax cheats, insurance rip-off artists, fraudsters, hate-crime hoaxers, etc. And if they ever use a library, I bet they won't return what they've borrowed on time - or at all. Probably will skip out on their library fines too."
4658,"Thanks for answering. Sorry I missed that you said earlier you weren't in the US. Duh.

 It's so interesting how norms and customs vary from place to place. I'd be interested to hear under what system of jurisprudence and which specific laws that annual school medical checks might be illegal. I'm not doubting what you said, just curious about the theory behind it. You'd think if this requirement was illegal anywhere, it would be in the USA, land of unbridled individualism run amok. But surprisingly, when it comes to things like schools, the US tends to be pretty community-minded, as regs in most school districts that make childhood vaccinations mandatory in order to attend school shows."
4659,"McKinnon and Mouncey piss me off big time. Mouncey looks like a damn linebacker. McKinnon is also comically large next to the other female athletes. Its ridiculous to suggest this is an even playing field. The whole reason we have womens sports in the first place is because women simply can't compete against biological males. Allowing trans athletes into womens sports is eventually going to completely destroy womens sports altogether. 

I do sympathize with people who are truly suffering from gender dysphoria, but it doesn't justify punishing women for being born female. I also feel like some of these athletes are only claiming to be trans because they know they can't compete against the men. Claiming trans people are the same as biological females is absurd. They are different and will always be different no matter how much surgery they get or hormones they take."
4660,"Regardless of whether Miller and Yearwood are actually taking cross-sex hormones and T-blockers now, it's already too late for them to take drugs to block puberty. The two cheats are both nearly 18, which means puberty for them is already done and completely over with. In the US today, African American boys typically begin puberty at 9, and puberty lasts 2-4.5 years.  Miller and Yearwood were already reaping all the benefits of male puberty in full flower when they started horning in on girls' sports."
4661,"I agree. I also think Jazz Jennings looks like a male who has used hormones and surgery to appear female, and not like a young woman. I also think that in a world where how inflated a ball is or how a running shoe is constructed are matters of utmost importance for fairness in men‚Äôs sports, whether a 6‚Äô3‚Äù man‚Äôs hormone regimen erases his advantage creates more than enough doubt to scrap letting him play against women."
4662,You see him standing next to Ellen Degeneres? Looked like a giant next to a Lilliputian.
4663,Exactly! Trans rights are not superior to women's rights.
4664,From my perspective in my city occupy devolved into a giant mud pit in the middle of town that became exclusively about the homeless. When it first started there was a lot of support and I saw mothers pushing strollers and all kinds of people. Then it was all about purity politics and they lost the average person. It ruined the park they were camping in and pissed off local businesses from all the people trying to use their bathrooms and littering everywhere.
4665,"Of course, that‚Äôs a given. We all understand that Trump is the worst president as far as women‚Äôs rights go. But Biden will not advance our rights. He may take us back a couple of steps on certain issues."
4666,"Ok, that sucks."
4667,">**On his first day in office**, he will reinstate the Obama-Biden Administration‚Äôs directive interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to include gender identity, and not just gender; restore trans students‚Äô access to sports, bathrooms, and locker rooms in accordance with their gender identity;

He will not.  As it currently stands, the Obama administration's directives have been stopped cold with a federal court issuing an injunction against enforcement.  The best Biden could do is continue the appeal where it left off at the 5th Circuit.   It might even be moot by then if the Supreme Court rules that the word ""sex"" in code means sex and not stated self-id to the contrary."
4668,"Thanks for the kind words. I imagine publishing this type of thing on Medium and pretty much everywhere else would get me banned and tarred for being a homophobe as well as a transphobe. But I am putting the points made above together with other points I've made on this sub about why we women need to see what's happening today not as the next step in ""LGBT"" civil rights, but as part and parcel of the larger project of male libertinism in which men of all sexual orientations and proclivities are involved.

BTW, though I'm basically hetero, I was very involved in activism and care for gay men who were sick and dying during the AIDS crisis. It's only been very recently that I'm coming to realize I have some perspectives on how what happened back in the 70s, 80s and 90s has fed into and led to today's trans mania."
4669,"It‚Äôs mostly guys doing this. Men are raised very differently for the most part, namely to be aggressive or persistent in their desires. And for everyone to respond with fright or fear, since they‚Äôll stomp and do something about it if they don‚Äôt get it. Add that with the strength they naturally have and how boys are sort championed in a familial role, their parents will go with it to avoid losing the affection of their son. And hope that by giving in earlier their kids will realize this is not as easy as the kids might think it is. Which is one way the community sticks out: They respond and act like men and expect results like men, and society is pandering to them because they‚Äôre men. Men expect things to happen since it‚Äôs men that hold most power/money. If most transitioners were women this wouldn‚Äôt be happening or would be shut down fast. But it seems most transitioned are mtf almost 3:1. Combine this with the traditional ways men are raised and you have guilt tripped parents...And a group of wolves trying for sheep‚Äôs clothing."
4670,Thanks for the link! I'm straight but joined the sub anyway because I don't think that trans people should be allowed to hijack the LGB movement. LGB people simply want to have sex with and marry who they want and not be discriminated against. Totally different than the trans agenda.

4673,It's frustrating because anyone else caught cheating would get the book thrown at them.
4674,"I feel bad for that kid but he shouldn‚Äôt be on testosterone if he‚Äôs competing against natal women, it‚Äôs unfair. Period."
4675,"i understood. the law is saying that if there is any confusion over birth sex the student will have to take a genetic test in order to be placed on the correct team; this would imply that they are being very stringent on making sure to arrange the teams by birth sex, whether male or female."
4676,"I think you're asking whether TIFs would end up in women's sports - yes, they would, but only if they're not taking T (and presumably have never taken T). Testosterone is classified as a performance-enhancing drug in sports and would be considered doping regardless of sex."
4677,"I would assume that forcing a medical check on a child would be illegal if you weren't the child's parent, but I don't really know much about the law so that is just my assumption. It sounds like something a school couldn't do or wouldn't even try to do though, especially checking for groin hernias? I cannot see parents agreeing to that as a standard procedure on their children and I would think privacy laws would protect people from required medical check-ups. I have also heard that many employers in the US do things like drug testing or medicals and I've never heard of something like that in my country either except for police and military. I thought that being required to disclose health conditions to a school or employers was a violation of basic human rights.

I know that at my schools you could not be forced to see a school counsellor or even to be in a classroom if you didn't want to be, but I've also heard that in the US police will ""catch"" kids for truancy which is absolutely flabbergasting to me. There was absolutely nothing our teachers could do to keep us in classes except lower our grades, and no one would question a kid being out on the street during school hours for various reasons. For that reason 'detention' didn't exist in my schools either because it was not legal to hold students anywhere against their will or force them to do anything, so school punishments were just suspensions, expulsions, etc. The US school system seems really authoritarian though even having security guards or cops on/near campus or the ability to search students' bags (this was also not allowed in any of my schools whatsoever).

Edit: OK, I looked it up in more detail and although I don't want to give away where I live, it does appear to be illegal for any school or employer to request medical files or records except in specific exceptional situations where I live. Those situations are normally things like extended medical leave and even in those cases employers can only request info pertinent to the specific illness, not including treatment or actual medical records. So I think that asking for a 'health form' from a physical would be illegal.

Edit 2: In some parts of my country but not others, schools can request vaccination info according to the law though."
4678,"> people who are truly suffering from gender dysphoria

Good luck finding them these days. It's disgustingly common for them to love their dicks, and just want to have *two* things they find sexy-- tits and dick. For too many it was never about genuine distress over not being a woman. I've even seen them shout at 'TERFs' to go back to their ""vagina club""."
4679,One of the sources for info on age when puberty starts: [https://www.webmd.com/children/news/20121020/earlier-puberty-age-9-10-average-us-boy#1](https://www.webmd.com/children/news/20121020/earlier-puberty-age-9-10-average-us-boy#1)
4680,"Methinks they take the sugar pills in the BC packs so they don't have to ""lie"" to the courts."
4681,"To me Jazz Jennings still has a rather masculine-looking face and though his height was stunted, you can tell his skeleton is male.  You can't, for example, create a female pelvis shape from a male one just with puberty blockers and hormones.  Jazz also looks a lot like his brothers, and when you look at his sister, you can see what a real woman with those genes will look like, and it is nothing like Jazz. 

I mean, the puberty blockers certainly did not prevent Jazz from getting the male hairline in that family instead of the female one.  Even little boys have a different cranial structure and hairline from little girls, and it's quite easy to tell a girl from a boy when they're just a couple years old."
4682,"And Ellen Degeneres is not a petite woman.  She is 5'7"" and though slim, not underweight or anything.  

Edit: Ellen comes up to the bottom on Nikkie's head.  I can't find a photo of the footwear he had on that day, but I am going to assume he was not wearing large heels as I can't find any photos of him in heels.  So I will give Nikkie and Ellen an equal footwear advantage.  Nikkie's cranium is twice the size of Ellen's.  Thus, I am going to put Nikkie in the upper percentile for male cranium size, so his head should be 9 inches from top to bottom. So I will actually concede that Ellen may be as low as 5'6"", though she claims to be 5'7.5"".  

Anyway, I think we have proof here that Nikkie is at least 6'3"".  My estimate after looking at lots of pictures of Nikkie: he is 6'3.5"".  For reference, here is a video of Ellen standing next to a man who claims to be 6'5"".  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bii-ci1Zc_c&feature=youtu.be

I have one more reason I think he is taller than 6'2"".  I'm 5'10"" and in 4 inch heels I am 6'1"".  I can't find a single photo where a woman even comes close to his height.  He is at all these fancy events with women in heels and apparently there is not a single woman there over 5'8"" in heels.  If he were 6'2"" and in flats (which always seems to be), then a tall woman in heels would not be that much shorter than him.  

So just like Laverne Cox, Nikkie is lying about his height to seem a little shorter.  It's incredible that he is clearly pushing 6'4"" even after puberty blockers."
4683,"Eh, as someone that's really used to being around women that are 6'0+, Nikki doesn't stand out terribly just is in the 99th percentile for female height, and admittedly is also in the 93rd percentile for male height.

People can say it's obvious all they want, but it clearly wasn't considering there was never any real speculation prior."
4684,But it's male supremacy and men hate watching women win anything when they think they can beat them.
4685,"That's what local elections are for. The president will only be willing and able to do so much without the guidance and acquiescence of the house and senate (and in turn those representatives and senators get most of their cues from the state senates and state houses of delegates), **so from there we'd need to keep voting in midterm and local elections as we're supposed to and make sure our representatives are informed of our stances on issues like this.** 

If Biden gets the hint that allowing men in women's sports and restrooms is politically unpopular, he'll make absolutely sure to go with the majority opinion and have trans athletes be banned. He wants reelection and political cachet, after all, so let's tell him what we want by voting and participating."

4688,"Not anymore, most transitioners now are young teen girls, and men are thrilled to profit off their gender role confusion and natural fear of males in general at that age. Teen girls obsess about boy bands and such to safely act out their attraction to males, this is along the same lines, becoming what they are most attracted to but fear at the same time. It's why they have to trans them early too, young women don't get confident around males and their own sexuality for quite a bit. It's so sick and twisted."

4696,"Yes, I was wondering if we were going to be looking at more Mack Beggs situations where a TIF on testosterone would win awards competing against girls who aren‚Äôt using any enhancement."
4697,"Thanks for answering. Just to clarify: in the US, schools and school personnel don't do the yearly medical checks - or the hernia checks on boys in sports.  Nor do kids have to go to particular doctors dictated by the schools or govt. for these exams. Parents can take the kids to any licensed physician; most go to their regular pediatricians. 

And as is the case with employers in the US, schools do not, and legally cannot, request or demand medical records ... There are actually strict rules in the US protecting the privacy of medical records. The schools' checklists are for very specific things such as vaccinations and healthy weight, height and bone development to make sure kids in school are well enough for school and Phys Ed, and they can't get or spread contagious preventable illnesses, they're getting proper nutrition, don't show signs of being abused at home, and whether they have developmental delays, sleep problems, adjustment issues etc.

I'm not saying the US way is the best way, or even a good way. My point was,  the hue and cry about how these state laws being proposed in the US will lead to ""policing trans kids bodies"" and ""checking genitals and DNA"" is silly because regs in the US already require kids to get examined by doctors annually, and the docs all already know the kids sex, which is clearly shown on the health forms the docs fill & sign.

Again, thanks for answering me."
4698,"To this I would add: how can you tell is someone is ""truly suffering from gender dysphoria""? There is no test for it. There's also no definition or description of GD that separates it from the various MH conditions that accompany or underlie it, such as depression, anxiety, OCD, narcissistic personality disorder, social alienation, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, ADD, and the rigid B&W kinds of thinking that people on the autism spectrum and without good life coping skills often display.  

Dysphoria, after all, is simply a fancy $500 medical-sounding, esoteric and sciencey word for plain old human  unhappiness, distress, discomfort and uneasiness. But ""unhappiness over my sex and the sex roles associated with it"" wouldn't get people nearly as much sympathy, would it?

Also, have you ever heard people with GD discuss their ""dysphoria""? No one with other mental health issues describes them in such an artificial-sounding, totally unconvincing way. For example, people with chronic depression don't say, ""my dysthymia is bad today."" No, they say things like, ""I can't get out of bed"" or ""I want to throw myself in front of a bus"" etc. And people who are psychotic don't speak clinically of their psychosis: they report what the voices are telling them, or what they see in their hallucinations.  But people who claim they have GD s say things like ""today I have extreme bottom dysphoria"" or ""I feel dysphoric"" all the time. None of them sound authentic or convincing at all.  It's like they learned about GD not from experiencing a unique internal condition, but from the internet and their friends caught up in the trans social contagion."
4699,"See, crap like that just alienates people. What could be more male than a penis?? If you truly feel like you were born in the wrong body and that you wish you were born female, then why the hell would you want to keep your penis? I'm baffled."
4700,"It kills me his sister is down to earth, minimum makeup, jeans and T-shirts, can't imagine what it's like to be the real female sibling in that family and treated like a guest. Jazz has already offhandedly dismissed her as future surrogate for his children, she'd be crazy to do it."
4701,Sorry for that.  I understand that it was Biden‚Äôs campaign saying that and you were just quoting.
4702,"Yup. But though the rich white ones may have more power than those who aren't rich and white, the male supremacy, misogyny, selfishness and libertinism of these men cuts across all socioeconomic classes and races."
4703,"So are all young women going to transition into men then because that fear of males is rational and will stick on until most of us start seeing the signs of age and freedom of economy, usually at our mid to late 30s. Where they also back off a bit since by that point women aren‚Äôt manipulated as easily. I agree with you that it is sick and twisted but in females it makes no sense: They want to transition to males for what? Most of society is straight and most lesbians like female looks and bodies, despite presenting differently sometimes. What they should be teaching young women is self defense among other things. Young women aren‚Äôt confident around males because of their bodies but rather how men reduce women because of their bodies: Men forget women are people not a resource. Women could treat men with all the respect and patience in the world and it won‚Äôt reduce that huge problem. And the sad thing is men don‚Äôt care about female boundaries. If they think taking hormones or transitioning into men or adopting male fashions will get women more confident and feel safer, they clearly haven‚Äôt seen how lesbians get fetished and treated by both straight men and transitioners. It‚Äôs revolting and frightening."
4704,"Omg that's awful, what bullies! How dare they try to force someone to have sex with them! I think it's pretty obvious that a lesbian wouldn't find a penis attractive, nor would a gay man find a vagina attractive. No one is entitled to sex with another person. And not wanting to date a trans person is not transphobic in ANY way. That's just ridiculous."
4705,I've lost track of how many times I've been called a bigot for not wanting to deal with a dick.

4708,"Not if they're implementing laws like this, I don't think."
4709,">Parents can take the kids to any licensed physician; most go to their regular pediatricians. 

Yeah, that's what I assumed you meant, but where I'm from the school couldn't demand medical records from students' regular physicians either, except for their immunization history in some areas and that's pretty new (like last 2-4 years I think). They can't/don't ask for things like height, weight, bone development etc. and kids' parents typically disclose allergies etc. only if they want to. In fact, where I live the government discourages yearly physicals for children in GENERAL, and have stopped paying doctors to do them in some regions.

I'm not arguing that the US shouldn't do it that way, I was just very surprised to hear that because even being on competitive sports teams throughout my schooling there was no medical anything we were required to do. So it wouldn't be as simple as just checking the medical records the school requests where I live, although I think it's blatantly obvious what sex children are in 99.9% of cases (excepting DSDs I guess)."
4710,"Yep. And if you look at the DSM criteria for ""gender dysphoria"" it's always like ""desire"" this, ""desire"" that, without ever getting to **the root of that desire**.

So you can be clinically diagnosed with ""gender dysphoria"" if you have the *desire* to have tits for sexual purposes. Because the desire itself is what matters foremost, not the reason. https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria"
4711,"Perhaps it's a blind spot of this sub, but your litany of the sins of ""Big Pharma"" left out one of the biggest, the pathologising of normal boyish behaviour and the push to treat it with drugs.
For balance, the (female-dominated) over prescription of SSRIs is also a concern."
4712,"And sexuality and their chosen ""gender"", male supremacy is male supremacy, done. No male group gets a pass."
4713,"No because all people cope differently with conflict and fear. A lot of it is internal struggle. Some girls will go with transing to become what they fear, just like some straight men trans to become what they crave but can't have.  Everyone handles their own struggles differently. And of course it's not the only reason girls trans. A lot of what adolescents do and less than mature adults do doesn't make sense. That's why it's up to parents, and then other authorities, to either help them or correct them, but some adults exploit the young and naive for personal gain."
4714,"and agree, men have entirely different boundaries than women , entirely different, women have to constantly fight to assert and defend their own boundaries against men, which is why we need strong laws based on sex or men will walk all over us, like the TRAs and MRAs are doing now."
4715,[removed]
4716,[removed]
4717,"Good point. You'd think that since their problem is that people with GD desire what they don't have and can never ever become because it's impossible, the solution might be to take up a religion or learn philosophy. Buddhism IIRC has at its core the aim of transcending desire and the self, while other religions such as Roman Catholicism are largely about denying and overcoming desire - especially when it comes to ""the flesh"" - and learning to defer gratification of one's wants and still find inner peace. Jeez, just learning and reciting the simple ""serenity prayer"" used in AA would probably do these people a world of good."
4718,"Yes, good points. I thought about mentioning the mass-RXing of the population with SSRIs, ADD drugs, benzos, hormonal BC etc that big pharma has also pulled off since 1989 (when the first SSRI was introduced). But my comment was already too long! I have noticed that nearly all the young so-called trans kids like Jazz Jennings are usually started on a cocktail of MH drugs early on, which I fear is fucking up their brains and messing with their development even further. This casual attitude towards drugging kids on a daily basis represents a sea change in the culture, and not for the better."

4767,FtM transgender people take testosterone.
4768,"> emotional and psychological identity as a female,

Define 'female' under the TRA mindset. Sometimes a 'dysphoric' TIM can love their penis and just want boobs to go with their penis. Their dysphoria doesn't have to follow a normal female body to be considered valid by the trans community. So they can also have 'dysphoria' about not having both a vagina and penis. I assume then that you support surgery to achieve these mentioned goals."
4769,No shit?
4770,"So true. I've known girls growing up who were depressed to the point of being suicidal because they thought they were ugly, their breasts were too small, they were too fat, etc. Why don't they get government funded plastic surgery? Why is their body dysphoria less important than the gender dysphoria of kids who erroneously believe thay can transform into the opposite sex?

Also, I think it's appalling that in left leaning states ""gender affirming"" procedures are free; but insulin, cancer drugs, and necessary dental work is not. But that's a rant for another day...."
4771,"The one that hits me hardest is body hair removal. Why the fuck is that shit potentially covered for TiMs when I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve heard of a single woman ever having insurance pay for laser hair removal of ANY kind! 

The blatant sexism, the embracing stereotypes and false perceptions/agreements that yes modern women should be hairless from the eyebrows down, the just...gall of dudes who pretend body hair is dysphoria inducing and hurts their identity as a woman. It‚Äôs fucking ridiculous."
4772,Why the fuck aren't people with facial deformities first in line when it comes to free/insurance covered plastic surgery? They can't leave the house without being started at and made fun of. A TIM can choose to not dress as a stereotypical woman and no one will bat an eye. People with facial deformities on the other hand have no choice but to endure daily verbal abuse if they're out in public.

Thus it's valid to ask 'her' gender clinic for dick enlargement to increase their 'womanhood'. Why only SRS? Insurance is transphobic for not covering feminine penis enlargement!"

4795,"I have honestly been very confused about this.  I still don‚Äôt understand the motives of men who cross dress and then call themselves lesbians.  I mean, wouldn‚Äôt logic dictate you‚Äôd stand a better chance of getting laid if you admitted to being a straight man and look for straight/bi women?

Plus, isn‚Äôt presenting as a super femme caricature sort of counterintuitive in this case, given that an awful lot of lesbians prefer more masculine women?  

And what do the moderators of lesbian subs have to gain by upholding this farce?  They‚Äôre losing women.  I‚Äôve seen arguments and abuse over at r/latebloomerlesbians over what constitutes ‚Äúlate bloomers‚Äù while several of the selfie posts yesterday are clearly men in wigs."

4801,"Not being attracted to penis is a crime when it hurts straight men's feelings/s

Please don't surrender, it's ok not wanting to date anyone for any reason at all. You are not transphobic if you don't wanna date trans, you are if you advocate for violence towards them. That's it."
4802,"It‚Äôs disgusting that in 2020 women can‚Äôt be attracted exclusively to other women without dealing with dumb males trying to insert their penis everywhere. No one cares about your penis sir, even if you throw a dress and a hat on it. Leave lesbians the fuck alone 2020. How about that?

4803,almost.. like... they're... obsessed with women?
4804,It's pure male entitlement that they take over women's subs. Heaven forbid a woman have her own damn place.
4805,"Women aren‚Äôt ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to have their own sexual/romantic preferences or boundaries. Seeing as many men see women as objects whose purpose is to serve them, it‚Äôs no surprise that these men would take offence to the idea of women being agents in their own right. They hate the notion that there could be people out there who have no interest in men whatever...it contradicts their narcissism. Hence they don‚Äôt seem to mind the gay communities on Reddit, but want to wipe out the lesbian community.

That said, r/ActualLesbians is known to be full of TIMs and their female panderers, so maybe you would have gotten a more supportive response on a more lesbian-oriented sub like r/LesbiansActually."
4806,"The thing is a part of the reason why men infiltrated our spaces is because we let them. Yeah it's difficult pill to digest but it's true.   


Libfems have sold us out, which is why all major female focused subs have men now (TIMs or just regular men). We have been betrayed by our own kind. The thing I can admire about men is that they stick up for their own kind, while our own betrays us for the eternal lie of ""inclusivity"". Women have been socially conditioned to be ""accommodating"" while men have not. Men don't even need gender critical theory because they are already conditioned to be gender critical. The gender critical feminist phenomenon is uniquely a female-only experience.  


You'll notice how female dominated spaces are ""inclusive"" while male dominated ones don't advertise to be ""inclusive"" (except for few pseudo-woke male subs). Inclusivity is a lie that harms women the most, it's even sad to realise that it's other women who are preaching this lie.   


The idea of a ""male TIF vagina"" for gays is revolting at best. I sincerely hope a lot of gay men peak in the near future as it will definitely help our cause."

Nice study, goes to show how there is clearly double standards. Gay men are allowed to not be attracted to trans men, but how dare a lesbian not be attracted to trans women.. you get banned and called a TERF & transphobic, just because we don‚Äôt like dick. While gay men can openly say they aren‚Äôt into pussy, and get no backlash whatsoever."
4811,"When I first came out, my guy friends started pointing out women and saying ""what do you think of her? her?  her over there?"".  It was madness, I still don't look at people that way today.  That's male socialization: looking at people and judging their appearance and labeling it ""attraction"".  

I don't work that way.  

I think it's telling that's the response you got ""you might look at someone and think they are pretty, so you can't say you are aren't attracted to them""."

I hardly see ‚Äútransmen‚Äù get sh*t but ‚Äútranswomen‚Äù are always praised up and down for ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù ‚Äúbeing brave‚Äù and etc. Notice how it‚Äôs mainly men in the trans movement front and center for trans rights. Men need to leave us women alone already!!
4822,">that the commenters on the AL thread, for the very short time it was up, were actually all TIMs. No words!

I just assumed they were men."
4823,"Wow, thank you for conducting this experiment! I wish I could say the results surprised me, but it‚Äôs still interesting to see things laid out like this."
4824,"Damn this is a straight up study. Well done. Not surprised about the results but it's important to document and you did a very nice job illustrating the difference. Men are allowed to have boundaries, women, nope!"
4825,What's TEHM?
4826,"If that pisses you off, you should see their thread ""If a man is attracted to TiMs, are they straight?"" The whole comment sections is ""well, of course, they're wOmEn!"" but literally the same thread about TiFs boils down to ""ew, vagina"". To be expected from gay men, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't think it smelled a bit of misogyny."
4827,"Thanks for the post, stuff like this could help people understand the issue from the perspective of males colonising female spaces."
4828,Male narcissism. Men think they should be allowed to have sexual autonomy but don't think women have this right because they don't see women as people.
4829,"I totally get why you are upset but this is too 1984 for me: ""how little they care about policing other men's thoughts"""
4830,"I like ur conspiracy theories, are funny"
4831,"Not only infiltration, they are actively pushing us out and silencing us! That's why I boycott pride events. It's no longer about us. Lesbians have always been under the shadow of gay men and since the trans cult dominates the whole show now, me and most of lesbians/bi women I know just don't feel welcome or even safe attending such events. Not to even mention gay bars, my female friend was nearly raped in the women's bathroom by a TIM.. during lesbian night. It sickens me too. Sorry for ranting."
4832,It's literal colonization. You know - the thing they keep screaming biological sex is and demonizing it in more darvo.
4833,Remember a few years back where they tried to do the ''male lesbian'' thing to be accepted as fetishizers and got promptly laughed out of every queer space? They found a way in.
4834,"There was one instance according to a Reddit thread where the men's bathroom was made gender neutral and the women's remained intact. The outrage! And the comments saying how they need to reverse this, so we get so pissed that we'll take the matters into our hands."
4835,"Women are the biologically weaker sex, that's why we need our spaces! To stay safe. If a male doesn't feel safe in the men's bathroom it's his business. Ours is ours and it's safe because only women can access it. I don't hate men but that's basic biology. Luckily, normal men will go to their own bathroom because they too find this shit regressive."
4836,I don't think they believe women have sex drives. They believe women are just bundles of niceness wanting to put others first.
4837,"And yet rape isn‚Äôt considered a hate crime. I wish the population was more like 80% women, 20% men, AND with no way that men could gain power."
4838,"I asked on a post on dykesgonewild if we can have a trans flair for trans posts because I literally saw a neovagina on there unexpectedly and so far its got -8 downvotes

what about my sexual boundaries? I want to see vaginas not neovaginas. what about consent? I didn't consent to see a neovagina. They are taking away my sexual autonomy by not putting the appropriate flair, are they not? All trans ""lesbians"" like vaginas but not all lesbians like neovaginas!

edit: now -11 feel free to go and upvote lol. Im also deffo gonna message the mods because not respecting consent and sexual autonomy is not ok!"

4842,"Straight/bi women don't validate their sexual desire to be women.  They need to be seen as a woman by the women they are attracted to.  Their arousal mainly revolves around themselves and the role they play in sex, rather than around another person as the object of their desire.  It doesn't matter what lesbians are attracted to as their inverted sexuality makes them attracted to the idea of themselves as the women they see in porn.  It's not a strategy for getting laid, it's a demand that other people engage in their self-orientated fetish

edt. the mods are all trans.  they've infiltrated lesbian culture at every level, and the women are too polite/afraid to fight back"
4843,"Men are more sexually predatory than women.  Many men are able to enjoy sex with women that are repulsed by them. Women are not built that way and would not want to be with a partner that was not attracted to them.

  I think many of these subs that they have forced their way into are just ""spank bank"" material for them.  ""Validation"" is another word for a boner."
4844,"I'm not a lesbian so take this comment with a lot of scepticism, but I have heard of men who want to ""turn"" lesbians straight. Seeing female homosexuality as a challenge rather than unchangable reality. My guess would be TIMs take this to the next level."
4845,"Motive: they don't know what lesbianism is about. They don't know what womanhood is about. All they care about is their own fetishistic view of both of these things.

And from that sub's description:

>A place for queer, gay, bi, pan, lesbian and questioning humans to share, give advice, and receive support!

What? Lesbians aren't even the first to be mentioned??? What's the point in the sub's name then? Lesbians can't have anything lol"
4846,"I have seen a TIM asking at r/latebloomerlesbians if he is really gay because he is into women, not into men...ü§¶ That's a straight dude, I would say..."
4847,I think that's why this sub keeps growing - it's all of the banned women who suddenly realised their 'women only' subs were full of men. That's what happened to me.
4848,">TIMs moderating feminist subs

Fucking madness. So much of feminist adult spaces is about undoing the trauma of early life female socialization, what the hell would someone who was visibly a man until his 20s or 30s (or later) know about that?

Even if TRAs were to argue that ""passing"" adult TIMs deal with adult sexism against women and thus can adequately *participate* in discussion (and I'm not even going to get into that minefield of a claim at the moment, because that one is highly debatable too, just less so than any claims about early life socialization)-*--* that's such a small part of the picture. I'd argue a majority of the d*eepest*, most relevant to feminist discussion, damage to women is all done before 15 years old.

Their experiences are woefully inadequate to even *participate* in those discussions, let alone moderate them. In fact, they're often flat out dismissive or angry with such discussions (for obvious reasons). (See Contrapoints video ""Gender Cynical"" in which Natalie hand waves away *the entire topic of female socialization and childhood* with **one** (literally one) sentence)

And then they claim that TIMs in women's spaces does no harm. It completely eradicates, or *at best* lowers the quality of, feminist discourse around socialization and childhood experience. Without which, I (and I assume many others) would not be who we are today. I'd probably still be in a fucking cult if I weren't exposed to such feminist discussions of childhood and social action/reaction.

It's even more disturbing because any effective feminist social change *has* to start with no longer giving every new crop of girls the same trauma to hopefully ""overcome"". We can't keep counting growing up with innumerable sexist experiences and internalized mysognistic ideas, only to *eventually* find feminism as a teen or adult, as a win. Because it's not, it's a band-aid. We need to stop damaging our girls so badly that they need a fucking Ph.D in feminist theory, social psychology, and political activism just to fucking \*function (\*with an *iota* of the social success/dexterity that a man can, naturally), in the first place. *That's* the ideal, not bandaid. after. libfem. bandaid.

But ineffectual, tardy, *bandaids* are *by definition* all feminist discourse without due respect for female socialization and early life experiences can do. Feminism that centers TIMs at the expense of our young girls is ineffectual lip service to some libfem, social media version of ""feminism"" that can never and will never raise the quality of life of any girl or woman on this planet. I really don't know what the whole point is for them if it's not about protecting and empowering the girls in all the ways we weren't protected and empowered."
4849,"That is what cracks me up about their hypothetical.  There has never once, in all of human history, been lesbian who has not clocked a TIM almost immediately.  Lesbians are not attracted to TIMs because TIMs don't look like real women.  They look like men pretending to be women.  

BTW, I am perfectly entitled to be attracted to a person initially, and change my mind later when I find out more about them.  Attraction is a not a static feeling; it's dynamic and can change over time.  I am also entitled to no longer be attracted to someone when I know something about their genitals that I don't like.  Not only am I entitled to have genital preferences; I am also entitled to have preferences about my genital preferences.  Now, this rarely comes up.  I am perfectly happy with most male genitals, but if something was up down there is made me lose sexual attraction to them, then that's just the way it is."
4850,"And that's just in a photograph. IRL, there's no amount of surgery that can make even a very petite, feminine man have the gait of a person with legbones attaching to the sides of the pelvis.

It's also easy to fall into uncanny valley with too much surgery, IMO."
4851,Even Gigi Gorgeous is clock-able imo.
4852,"Mussolini wants a word with them (like, in fascism you had to be register to(?) The party even if you thought it was bs or else...)"
4853,"Kind of defeats the purpose of the word ""actual"" huh?"
4854,"That sums it up.

They can't fathom not being the center of attention.

What? They don't want or care about my dick? About my male gaze? About my self important male monologues? Having sex without the superior male!! It must be a crime! How dare those women!"
4855,"Any women only group, there are always men trying to infiltrate and ruin it. Always."
4856,"Lesbiansactually was taken over by TiMs about a year or so ago. The usual routine of ""why is there so much transphobia on this sub?"" followed by new trans mods being added and anyone who didn't worship their dicks being banned."
4857,"Got banned from r/LesbiansActually for calling out a user who blustered to knock terfs' teeth out. 

Go check my post history, I took screenshots because I already knew what would happen next. Also, the op, who was a TIM, told a person to choke on his dick. But I bet his comment wasn't against the rules uwu!!"
4858,Literally every lesbian sub get infiltrated by TIMs. Which is why a lot of lesbians come to GC even though it's not explicitly a lesbian sub.
4859,"Such an excellent post.

I used to be a bit like that too due to conditioning.

We're supposed to be fair, nice, include everyone so they don't feel bad

Little girls get punished for being too loud, for not sharing, being mean to other kids

Little boys not so much. 

&#x200B;

It would do us some good to be rude to people that hate us and want to harm us."
4860,Including  the mod team. It‚Äôs actually preposterous the ratio of actual lesbians to transbians on the mod team.   I would wonder why the lesbians allow it without protest but I already know that all the actual lesbians have been chased away to other subs and the sub is majority transbians and some very young gay and bi girls.
4861,I second that!
4862,I heard that in a  DALEK Voice
4863,Wow. You should post this as its own post here.
4864,Holy shit. This is pants on head stupid.
4865,I don't know but I'm curious how they're gonna turn that one into a low brow toilet joke
4866,"Homophobic acronym made up by straight girls who call themselves gay men and who are upset gay men aren't interested in them. It stands for ""transgender exclusionary homosexual male""."
4867,"As far as I can make out, trans ideology is fuelled by misogyny.

Sometimes it‚Äôs internalised, sometimes it‚Äôs externalised, but it‚Äôs a constant, shitty presence"
4868,Why don't you mention the fact that you're male yourself?
4869,Policing as in demanding to take control of certain spaces and then banning dissenting thought & allowing threatening language towards those who disagree. There's no way to discuss it without it sounding 1984ish.
4870,How‚Äôd ya find the sub?
4871,"I still go to pride events, because I won't let them be taken from me. I carry a knife and I'm a tall, strong butch."
4872,"There was a time when lesbians were not under the shadow of gay men, as you put it: it was during the AIDS Crisis. Men 60+ in America, at least, should remember this time when lesbians founded and ran AIDS organization, raised funds, organized protests and resistance while teaching men how to do these things, worked and volunteered alongside gay men in ACT UP, GMHC,  ACLU National AIDS Task Force, New Orleans AIDS Task Force, SHANTI, nursed gay friends and neighbors and were there at their bedsides as they died even as their families of origin and sometimes their friends, ex-lovers, and partners abandoned them out of fear, and eulogized them. 

The next time an older gay man treats you badly or ignores you as a lesbian remind him of the debt his generation owes to his lesbians sisters of his generation. I am one of these women who volunteered for two of these organizations up above. 

I lost a lot of friends and older gay friends whom I considered social mentors, who had taught me what it meant to be a gay or lesbian in straight society in the 1970s-‚Äò80s, taught me how to navigate in that society as a lesbian and be a success. I wish they were alive today to see the 63 year old successful, married  lesbian who that 20 year old girl has become."
4873,"Been raped by a FTM in a gay bar. It happens.
Edit: spelling"
4874,"Interesting, I didn't know that was a thing. So was a ""male lesbian"" a man who wants to bed lesbians?"
4875,"I've seen another where all toilets made gender neutral, stalls and sinks only, and after men got to a certain level of drunkenness they started openly pissing in the sinks. Urinals are there for a reason."
4876,"The other root of this need sex add segregation is that men are, as a class, unbelievably violent - against other men, young boys, young girls, women and even animals. Guess who they can get away with brutalizing, while cementing their patriarchical privilege?"
4877,"That's probably why they use the ""most transwomen don't want to use their dicks!"" lie on lesbians so often- it doesn't even occur to them that lesbians actually like women and enjoy the female body."
4878,"That‚Äôs because they are men who are either adults and have had (possibly failed) marriages with possibly unsatisfied wives. 

Or they are young and have never actually slept with women.

In any case, in some societies, including Western Christian society, it has been convenient to believe that good women did not have sexual drives or experience sexual pleasure. If a woman did she was a bad, wanton woman, a Trollope, etc. she was likely to be a prostitute, in a harem, or some rich or powerful man‚Äôs mistress."
4879,You mean bundles of niceness with the sole purpose of receiving a (girl)dick
4880,I feel like I shouldn't be shocked by I'm still shocked.
4881,I recently heard truelesbians is hostile to GC women. I hope that‚Äôs just a rumor. Can you answer?
4882,I was watching a lesbian philosopher talk on the gender issue and she said if we are not allowed to name women being attracted to the same biological sex lesbians we will just have to rename it because it's still reality. And that is sorta what's happening.
4883,"I went back and had a deeper look and you're completely right!

Not just a TIM, but a TIM that isn't *""currently""* deciding to call himself intersex. 

Every single one is a man. Fuck me."
4884,That is just...alien to me.  There‚Äôs no other word.
4885,"Straight women don't validate them, but as terfs we need to be raped into submission. I guess they won't enjoy it, just taking one for the boys (girls hush ma mouth)."
4886,"You're right. I remember the 'shock' when I read in Tinder's own stats that 90% of men swiped right on a woman they deemed 1 on the scale of attractiveness.

So yeah, they totally swipe right on a woman they're not attracted to at all -but would still fuck."
4887,"That makes sense.  Actually, that would explain an awful lot."
4888,">but I have heard of men who want to ""turn"" lesbians straight.

I've heard this too, from lesbian and bisexual friends. My friend Katie lost count of how many time she was told she'll stop being bi when she 'gets the right dick' like it's going to change something in her so dramatically."
4889,So incomprehensible to me that they‚Äôre willing to make themselves ridiculous for this.  It‚Äôs like they have no concept of how they appear to others.
4890,This is called 'corrective rape'.

They know that lesbianism isn't about them. That's why they constantly attack and try to change it."
4892,"I‚Äôm pretty new to social media in general and joined Reddit just for fun, trying to keep an open mind.  I haven‚Äôt dated in a long time and done very little socializing within the internet LGB community so I really wasn‚Äôt prepared to get hit with the reality of this agenda.  I try to be pacifist and accepting of the individual, but...well.  Being told I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù woman was a rude awakening.  I‚Äôm having to reevaluate a lot right now."
4893,Heterosexuality with extra steps.
4894,"Yep me too. Banned from all my regular subs because I said a penis can't be female LOL. I can't say I'm unhappy it happened though, as it has opened my eyes."
4895,I think we've gained 1k followers over IWD (???) mods?
4896,I love everything about this post so much that I wanted to start a slow clap in my living room. Right fucking on to all of this! It's beautiful and I love you for it!
4897,This is perfect and so truthful and it makes me hurt so badly that we are still so far from achieving that.
4898,"I think that's one reason they post so many photos for validation. IRL, there are so many giveaways. Years ago, I was at a club with a friend who introduced me to his friend ""Margot."" Even in a dark club, I asked my friend after about five minutes, ""Was your friend Margot formerly a man?"" He said, ""Yes, but don't tell her you noticed. She hates when people notice.""

""She"" was at least six feet tall and had shoulders too wide for a woman."
4899,">Gigi Gorgeous

Never heard about this person so I went to google and see the wedding; he's a whole man (I could tell at first glance), who had watched too, too, too much porn and remade himself to look like the pornstars he is so obsessed with.   


I'm seeing how many men are identifying with the female roles from porn. The ""*I'm no bi because I don't like to kiss a man or cuddle with him, I just want to suck his dick and be fuck, so I'm straight*"" crowd, come from a place where they have watched so much porn and want to be in the female place since all the porn are built exclusively in objectifying women bodies so man are just a prop.   


It's sick since these dudes are incredible homophobes too."
4900,"Gigi is clockable because she has a ridiculous amount of plastic surgery and makeup! So much money, pain, and time spent on it, and you can still tell something‚Äôs not quite right. Same thing with Blair White..."
4901,"He's as masculine as any man. There's absolutely nothing feminine about him, to my eyes."
4902,"We're fascists for acknowledging sex, they're progressives for telling us to bow our heads and obey. Hm....."
4903,Actually bisexual women and actually straight men is more like it üôÑ
4904,"This is their modus operandi. They are going to try to be pitied, then allowed to be mod, next they silent any who dares to challenge their narrative, next they have taken over everything."
4905,Other safe havens outside Reddit are FeministCurrent and L Chat.
4906,AL is great for a laugh on occasion but the smaller subs are way better for everything else. My favorite is probably the butch sub just because we all butch in there and that's that.
4907,"And many of the Bi women, like me have been chased away for telling them how shitty they are being to lesbians.  I've been banned from multiple groups for standing up for lesbians. It's infuriating.  By the time people get angry and see what is happening it is going to be too late."
4908,Just didnt seem relevant to me saying I thought OP did a good job is all
4909,"I'm pretty sick today and running at about 40% brain throttle, so I might be confused. I thought you were originally implying men SHOULD police each others' thoughts but from the reply it sounds like you are referring to it as a bad thing? 

I am a free speech advocate, preferring assholes out themselves and no one be given an artificial moral position to choose whose words are and are not safe.  Authoritarian shut down does not not change minds - and usually results in backlash.  I would hope that the goal is to change society's perception, which at a grass roots, person-to-person level requires give and take conversations (in that you can't understand where it went wrong without understanding the person's point of view and sharing your own)."
4910,"I just saw others like u and googled it

""Trans right are men right"" First time i see someone saying that a problem that men suffer is being prostituted and raped in high amounts, ""gender critical"" U are very funny"
4911,"That's honestly great to hear! Though I wish we didn't have to carry any protection to feel safe. In the early 2010s I recall pride in my area being really laidback and fun, sure it had it's protests and whatnot but participants were actually civil and open to curious people. But during the last 5-6 years, it turned into trans rights yell contest with police being called in because it got violent. But of course, when men ""protest"" it has to include punching people who disagree."

4915,"Pretty much. A man who felt like he ''is'' a lesbian because he doesn't like having PIV sex or has fetishized the way lesbians have sex from porn. Most I've ever known of eventually transitioned because it was an easier way in and meant easier access to queer women, and because it was the natural conclusion of going deeper into the fetish."
4916,"Oh I've been to places where there's the ""stall bathroom,"" and the ""stall and urinal"" bathroom.. Just more of the ""Mens bathroom, everyoen else bathroom"" BS"
4917,"I worked as a cleaner once. Men's bathrooms were ALWAYS worse than women's. It seems that a lot of men don't know how to flush a toilet. They also used less handpaper than women which makes me ask do they even wash their hands?? The floor was sticky because of urine and it smelled awful.

Yeah, one more reason I don't want to share my bathroom with men..."
4918,"But that's true, we lesbians only want a relationship so we can be besties. We just hug and cuddle and watch silly rom coms together.

&#x200B;

/s"
4919,"They allow *some* GC discussion, but I was unreasonably banned for openly discussing that one of the mods seemed to be censoring content that is ""too"" GC (for example, I am VERY GC and very open about it on reddit. A month or so ago, I'd tried to post a GC-related, lesbian-related topic on truelesbians 3 or 4 times and it never made it onto the sub. So I changed the title so that it didn't include ""trans"" and guess what‚Äìit went through right away and was posted! And also, one of my prior submissions that WASN'T posted was downvoted from +1 to ""0"" at a time when it wasn't even published for anyone but the mods & I to see, so that means that one of the mods DID see my post(s), refuse to publish them, and even actively downvoted one in the process!) 

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that lesbians‚Äì‚Äìi.e. HOMOSEXUAL FEMALE people‚Äì‚Äìhave a place to gather without males. But at least one of the mods (the one with ""pineapple"" in the username) has been openly opposed to GC discussions multiple times (under the guise of ""we've been talking about trans people too much, the whole point of this sub is to get away from that, let's talk about something else""‚Äì‚Äì*completely* ignoring the fact that **transactivism/MtFs infiltrating lesbian spaces is literally the biggest, most important issue facing lesbians in 2020**. And ignoring the elephant in the room to talk about shit like our favorite colors is NOT going to help lesbians organize to effectively push lesbian-identified males out of spaces intended for homosexual female people. Most lesbians understand this).

 Anyway, at this point, I do suspect that at least one of the moderators at that sub‚Äì‚Äìthe one with pineapple in their name-‚Äìmight be male. Or, they might be an actual lesbian who is anti-GC for whatever reason; hard to tell. But I got banned, ostensibly for trying to vocalize my concerns about censorship on the sub & hinting at the moderator in question's username (after repeatedly, persistently trying to engage the mods in a direct message conversation about the issue of censorship on the sub *privately*, but they wouldn't engage). To be honest though, I think the REAL reason I got banned is because of how GC I am and how much GC content I was posting to truelesbians, and I think that at least one mod (the one I've been hinting at here) was just looking for a reason to ban me. I know this because they actually did try banning me for a petty reason before, about 10 months ago, and then I talked to another mod and she reversed my ban immediately since pineapple overreacted extremely (I don't even remember what my stated ""offense"" was for that extremely short temporary ban). 

Just putting this info out here so that lesbians can go into the sub informed. If you don't stick out too much, you should be fine, and the userbase does seem to be mostly, if not all, female. The mods *might* have a trans male mole on their team, but it's hard to know for certain."
4920,"it‚Äôs the worst but it gets even weirder when you realize the guy saying he will turn a lesbian straight has bad breath and had sexual intercourse with 1,5 people in hist lifetime (the 0,5 of course is for that one time he went to the movies with a woman and creamed his pants, but he counts it anyway)."
4921,IWD?
4922,Joining in on the slow clap until it become a raucous roar!
4923,"I also don't think men are as skilled at clocking them, either. IMO it is likely epigenetic in women, from generations of spotting potential predators.

Transmen are clocked fairly easily too, especially chubby ones - they have no 'moobs' like chubby guys do because they've flattened or removed them, and the hip sway is hard to hide."
4924,"Yeah, also because he's a man."
4925,You mean he....? Gigi Gorgeous and Blair White are males!

The fact that you say this

without mentioning the fact that you are a man yourself is hypocritical. You are doing exactly what you're criticizing."
4929,"Yeah, I think it's a bad thing to police anyone's thoughts. It's just amazing how they work SO hard to police *women's* thoughts in comparison to men's! Agree wholly with your stance."
4930,Nice reply! There is a huge TRA/MRA overlap for a reason. :P
4931,In London pride there's regular complaining that the police are protecting religious groups who peacefully counter protest. Basically the subtext is the pride marchers should be able to rip those guys apart with the state cheering them on.
4932,PRIDES in Canada are being cancelled because trans people dig in their heels on certain issues.
4933,Just as I have never forgotten my positive gay friends who didn‚Äôt survive.
4934,"Good question. IMHO some of the fields that that generation of gay men was often limited to due to the homophobia of the 1950s -1989 were not fields that lots of women, particularly lesbians were seeking to be in. In other fields though perhaps women would have been squeezed out or not given opportunities to begin with. I never thought about that."

4958,"HRT does not change the male body enough for it to be fair for him to compete against females. 

Not sure what you mean by the first sentence.

The link showed women‚Äôs rights and how men who self-ID as ‚Äòwomen‚Äô are bulldozing over them. This is what a lot of ‚ÄúTrans rights‚Äù are about- the right for men to occupy women‚Äôs spaces, to deprive women of sex-based rights in favor of self-ID ‚Äògender‚Äô rights. 

There are some trans-specific rights that I agree with then fighting for, like to not be fired on basis of being trans, or to not be targeted with violence like your comment touched on, but unfortunately they lump things like that in with the other fights that hurt women.

Trans men are not superior to men athletically because they‚Äôre still limited by the characteristics of their female body that HRT can‚Äôt change. The reverse does not apply.

Btw, do you think there‚Äôs nothing wrong with a transwoman going ‚Äòstealth‚Äô and not telling a stranger hookup that they have a penis until after engaging in sexual activity with a supposedly straight man? I view that as the transwoman raping the man."

5011,"Poster asked one of them in there if there in favour of banning sports, here's their response: 


> Not really. I'm in favor of changing the way we organize sports. Dividing competitions by gender is barely an improvement over not dividing them at all, and the issue with not having divisions is that you basically end up awarding wins not based on talent or effort, but based on genetics. There are some physical differences that no amount of training will overcome. A 5'5"" guy is not going to consistently beat a 6' guy at basketball, and it's not because he's not talented enough or didn't train enough, it's because of a factor that's entirely out of his control. It's at least a little better in sports that have weight classes. That's what we need more of: divisions that match competitors with others that have similar physical characteristics.

They should have signed it off with ""sincerely, someone who's never played sports competitively"" 
Imagine being so up your own ass with your ideology that you try and ban/change how sports are managed because you think its a unjust conspiracy against genetics, what a fucking moron."

when the european migrant crisis happened all sorts of insane amateur porn popped up on pornhub stuff like 'busty woman tries to feed her family' or 'border patrol kidnaps woman and her teen daughter'. men LOVE this kind of thing. porn companies are evil for recruiting but dont forget about the married men with fancy careers and children, dont forget that they are watching and feeding this industry"

5228,">men really like when women are poor and desperate, they love the idea of a wage earning woman suddenly having to strip and have sex with men just to help pay her rent.

Yes.  **Some form of ""sex work"" is, in general, what systematic male dominance** ***aims*** **to keep women participating in**.  Traditional marriage and prostitution are two sides of the same coin in that regard.  In practice, patriarchy fucking loves both and produces both, to be variably taken advantage of.

I never facepalm more than when ""feminists"" with bad analysis assert that men don't like the sex industry because it's one of the only industries where women can earn a high hourly wage, framing it as a kind of income redistribution.  Men support pro-SI policies far more than women do so it's obvious that they are NOT threatened by it existing and they do NOT want it to go away. Many of them just enjoy shitting on the women in it regardless while promoting its use, openly or more passive-aggressively (and let's be real, sometimes not figuratively....), because the contempt and abuse is part of the point and part of the fun.

It's also really obvious that prostitution is not a viable way to increase women's social, political and economic status as a group, if it was it would be done by now.  But leaving aside the fact that very few women in SW actually achieve long-term upward mobility:

It's *not* an accident that biases against women that limit our earning potential exist in nearly every other industry *except* the sex industry.  It's that way because that's where they'd prefer us. **A concrete sexual marketplace doesn't threaten the patriarchy, it's what the patriarchy exists to create.**

Women having full control over their own sexual decisions, to have or not to have and if so with whom, and being able to make them without being in any way subject to power plays and external leverage (including need for $$),  is what threatens patriarchy as far as that goes."
5229,"Yeah, the watchers wash their hands of the content because it's conveniently removed from them by distance, by immunity given by the porn frame, and by the license given them by their male membership card. At worse, the only price is a bit of guilt, which adds to the sexual excitement and is quickly absolved by the patriarchy in the sky."

Do not post links or screen caps that have identifying personal information from Facebook, Twitter, or anywhere else. The post will be deleted immediately and the reddit admins may suspend your account permanently.

* Facebook posts need all names and profile photos removed. This includes ""page"" names and the like, since the point is to stop people finding the comments in question.

* Twitter posts need usernames and @handles removed. Exceptions apply only to verified accounts with blue checkmarks.
  	
* Tumblr posts do not need to be redacted unless there is a large amount of personal info present.

* Posts about public figures are OK. A public figure is someone whose name has been in the news, on tv, in movies, or in articles in magazines or newspapers (or news websites). Politicians, actors/actresses, news presenters, sports stars, etc. Even when someone is a public figure much of their info may still be considered personal. Things like home addresses, home phone numbers, the phone number for their workplace. 

* A good way to check if someone's name is considered personal info is to do a quick google search. What do you find? If you find Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, or a blog with that person's name, this would be considered personal and is not okay to post on reddit. The vast majority of people fall into this category and that is why screenshots of Facebook and Twitter are nearly always a problem if names have not been obscured.

The way the humans feel - humiliated , powerless , wronged - that's how we feel all the time . Realistically though , it shows how pathetic and insecure men are - the more actual power we gain in society , the more violently they fight back and the more they turn to methods such as gaslighting and subterfuge to undermine us, divide us, lead us off course and anything to destroy our credibility as equal human beings .   

It does really make me sick.  If men didn't keep looking at us as powerless wank material , they might start to see us as something more . Real .  It's like how people treated black people during and following the slave trade - caricatures or something to use or at least laugh at .  Our struggling amuses them ; our pain humiliation arouses them ; our success enrages them . Fucked up, man."

5256,"Especially when they, and their penises, get to be the rescuing savior"
5257,"Perfectly put.

Men would rather have women poor and vulnerable so that they can:

buy us/have sex with us without having to please us or have real relationships with us.

When women have money we will choose not to have sex with men who will sexually degrade and hurt us but only have sex with men for our own pleasure.

Since men don't want to change themselves so they are actually worthy of this (being decent and prioritizing the woman's orgasm) it is much easy to:

abuse us as children (being socialised female is in many ways child abuse) 

so that we are constantly financially vulnerable.

and therefore easier to victimize/we will be forced to have sex with them"

Something men will never understand. No man in history has *ever* feared being forcibly impregnated, specifically because they're males, and males don't get pregnant.

Of course this danger isn't *what makes a female a female*, but it's a fact that the reason it's a danger is **explicitly because she's female**.

5336,"By their own (wrong) logic, aren't they prioritizing men over women?"
5337,"Ben isn't a biological man. Ben is a biological woman/female. Who chooses to live out the social construct/ fantasy that they are a man in their lives. And expects the world (including all women who are ok living in the bodies they were born in and who buy Always sanitary towels) to conform to that social construct/fantasy without any regard for that other majority of people who don't have the mental illness/fetish preference that imposes solely their will on everyone else.  
If I met Ben and they told me they were called Ben and to use he/him if I wouldn't mind because it made them feel more comfortable. Then i would do so, because that makes Ben more comfortable living their own life, with which I'm absolutely fine doing. But in doing so I would merely be being polite and valuing Ben as a human being with their own ideas and way of living. I wouldn't actually believe that Ben was a biological male, just that they wanted to be referred to in a very narrow stereotypical social construct that they perceive to be male.

So if sex is male/female and gender can be anything you choose, Ben has the biological sex of a female (the two options being male and female) and the idea of gender of (the closest they can get to an approximation of) male.  


I feel concern and sympathy and empathy for Ben because they are unhappy in the fundamental physical reality of their existence, and choose to relieve that by constructing a different reality for themselves. However, when their new construct comes up against actual reality - like having periods (though I understand for trans men (TIF) the hormones they take stops periods pretty quickly), or such as the 50% of the global population realising that Ben is living a fallacy and has been enabled to impose that fallacy on everyone else with periods - then their ideology and insistence that their ideology takes precedence becomes a talking point.  


To discuss such issues is NOT transphobic. To disagree with Ben's point of view about the symbol for women being appropriate on packaging for a product exclusively designed for biological females is NOT transphobic. 

On the contrary, the phobia appears to be about biological females having the right to speak about their own experiences and feelings. 

I support the transcommunity being a part of the world, noone should live in fear or be disadvantaged, but at the same time, the giving of rights to a minority ought to be adding to the world, not supplanting or restricting a different section of the world.

People are entitled to their own opinions but NOT their own facts. So the person who told you it was transphobic nonsense, that is an opinion. They hold their opinion. They are entitled to hold it. Just as I am entitled to hold my opinion. What they are NOT entitled to do is to seek to stop people with different opinions from exploring the issues just because they are uncomfortable with scrutiny."
5338,Let them know that they are gaslighting you by saying that because females face sex-based discrimination and cannot identity out of it.  Also they‚Äôre being misogynistic by trying to name call you into silence about very real issues that only affect females.  It‚Äôs absurd that this has to be stated in the first place.

Sorry, but even seemingly ""harmless"" compliance like this just fuels the fire even more. There's no reason to adhere to *any* of their insane rhetoric, no matter how ""polite"" they believe it to be - calling a woman a ""man"" is no more polite than calling an apple a banana, it's just... incorrect."

5344,Always removed the venus symbol from the packaging of their pads.
5345,"Funny you mention the word ""suitcase."" The stalker sub posted a quote from this with some commentary that they wanted to throw away the entire suitcase. For once, something they're saying actually makes sense. They want to throw away the ""suitcase"" of meanings for words like ""female"" and ""woman"" and just start over from scratch in an alternate reality or something."
5346,"I think I get what you're saying...? Like women are supposed to be their ""sisters,"" so the fact that we're not advocating for their ""rights"" (AKA our own erasure) is somehow worse than men actually killing them? Because by default we're supposed to be accommodating allies, or something? Did I get it? ;)

But I will say, when you see this issue raised in online fora, TRAs have a vastly different reaction to women than they do to men who are critical. Men are ignored, even understood. Women are shrieked at and threatened. I've tried to wrap my head around this, to understand why, and they only thing I can think of is the old stereotype of men being reasonable and ""just speaking their minds,"" while women are hysterical. In this instance, that is especially cruel, because these things don't affect men. Just women. How dare we get emotional about it, right?"
5347,"> We all know that the reason for getting upset is **not about the change in packaging, but about the public pronouncement that periods are not female in nature.** If you try to argue against this, you will be told that you are ‚Äúreducing women to their genitals.‚Äù Again ‚Äì this is gaslighting.

5352,"yes. but this was a transman. a biological female who identifies as a male and therefore doesn't want the symbol for biological females on their packs of sanitory towels. Personally I'd have thought the difficulty of identifying as male whilst having periods would be a bigger issue, but what do I know!"

5354,What about the trans women who stuff tampons up their asses? Doesn't anyone care that they wanted to keep the female symbol?
5355,"Yeah it's funny.

&#x200B;

It's essentially usurping our symbol such that we (""cis"" people) can't use it, but they can. They become the final arbiters of what ""female"" means, ""woman"" means, what the experience of gender is like, and what symbols represent and how they can be used.

5365,"I think ""respecting pronouns"" is a perfectly understandable position for a newcomer to have. I'd recommend the ""Pronouns are Rohypnol"" piece to them. It truly put words to the weirdness I've felt about calling a female person she or a male person he. It's in the sidebar, I think. ;)"
5366,"I think OP is referring to women being told that they‚Äôre ‚Äútransphobic‚Äù for saying that menstruation is a women‚Äôs issue. Women who are hurt by this are being made to believe like we are in the wrong and being the perpetrators of hate, simply for having an opinion on our own bodies and functions. We are made to question ourselves if we are wrong to feel hurt by this PR stunt, as if trans men and men are the only ones allowed to have feelings and opinions on menstruation. The definition of gaslighting is ‚Äúmanipulating someone by psychological means into questioning their own sanity‚Äù. It‚Äôs possible that some of the trans men and ‚Äúallies‚Äù are not intentionally manipulating women into questioning their own sanity, but that is what it is resulting in."

If you posted it on your wall, it is your right to do so. Personally I continue to share such things on my wall, I've had similar responses. My reaction was to insist that any discussion is (a) polite and (b) everyone understands that they are entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts.  


So in this instance, Ben has periods. Only biological females can have periods. Ergo, Ben is a biological female. That's factual, logical, scientific, empirical cold hard facts.  


Ben retains the sex of biological female AT THE SAME TIME as choosing to live their life as the 'social construct' they perceive as male. The key here is THEIR PERCEPTION. This perception of Ben's that Ben is male, is intangible, it can't be seen, without hormones or surgery, it doesn't show in their face, body, voice or mannerisms, because they are an adult human female and biology determines that skeleton, fat distribution, muscle mass, and pitch of voice is all in a range that humans have for millenia been able to recognise as biologically female.

This is why misgendering happens, because the biological reality that third party strangers hear or see gives signals of biologial femaleness, they cannot see intangibles, only visual and auditory cues. Only the intangible idea that Ben is male tells us that he is male. Which is why you end up with people choosing male sounding names and specifying pronouns as male, because it signals Ben's perception of themselves.

However, unless you live in a country where misgendering is a crime in and of itself, rather than say intentionally to cause distress (harassment), the average stranger has no idea of what Ben's perception of themselves is. What's more, a gender critical feminist would argue that Ben's perception of themselves should not require external validation from total strangers.  


You are a total stranger to Ben. You are not required to validate their perception. You are not required to invalidate your OWN perception on your OWN wall just to torture logic to fit an ideology that you do not hold yourself.  


If for example I said I was a Christian and believed in God. And you said you weren't and didn't.   
How would you expect me to respond?   
To call you a heretic (best equivalent of transphobe I can come up with)? to claim that you have insulted me and my feelings by not believing what I believe?  That you aren't allowed to say to me that God doesn't exist and you don't believe in him?   
Of course not. And yet by telling you taht you have misgendered Ben, that is exactly what this person is doing - telling you that your world view and your beliefs are of no consequence in comparison to those of a total stranger.  


Frankly, if this person is an actual friend, in real life, I'd be re-evaluating what my ideas of friendship are. To me a friend is someone who seeks to be kind and uplifting of their friends, to understand that everyone has different beliefs and viewpoints, and that it is important to acknowledge reality and facts and what is reasonable to expect, as well as to hold each other to account when we are in error. Me, I'd be asking if that friend fulfilled my criteria or not. I'd also be challenging them on any errors of logic I'd perceived and having a discussion (politely) about the issues involved.  


But it's your wall. You do what you want to do. You are an adult. You get to choose."
5383,"The usage of she/her and he/him has historically been and, for most of the English-speaking world, continues to be sex-associated. Not gender. 

When someone insists that it is gender-based, they mean one of two things. Gender as in cultural norms of masculinity and femininity that vary with time and place. Or gender as in a feeling which has no consistent, definable qualities. With regards to the first, we do not call butch women by male pronouns, nor feminine men by female pronouns ‚Äî no matter how masculine or feminine they may be. I know several butch women who are routinely mistaken for men upon first glance, then people stammer and correct themselves upon actually looking at them. Because they've accurately identified the sex of the woman in front of them and thus correct their mistaken understanding. Gendering people based upon cultural norms of masculinity and femininity quickly falls apart, and most people don't bother. 

Which brings us to gender as an unobservable feeling with no consistent definition. An ""essence"" of affinity toward certain words is about what it comes down to. A preference. And from there we are meant to conclude that this feeling, this affinity is important enough to override pronouns being sex-based; important enough that sex-based pronouns be abandoned altogether, because affinity for how one is addressed matters more than sex. I would argue that it does not.

Sometimes people try to argue that because we must rely on visual and auditory clues to make our informed guess of one's sex, we *must* be relying on cultural norms of masculinity and femininity. As if we are not a sexually dimorphic species which relies on accurately sexing other members of our species for purposes of reproduction. Their assertion is that we, with our incredible brain, cannot do something that other sexually-reproducing species do every day, upon sight. Their assertion is further that because there are sometimes mistakes, even as rare as they are, the whole categorization is suspect and we must instead rely only on the word of each individual person. Nevermind that mistaking someone's innate gender feelings is *never* seen as cause to discard that system as flawed.

Edit: pronouns -> she/her and he/him"
5384,"What doesn't help is that liberal feminists do not actually believe gender roles are malleable or even bad, even if they'll pay lip service to the idea as long as it's conveniently disconnected in context from the trans thing. To liberal feminists, to stop the oppression of women means to begin appreciating the feminine social box the same as the male one.

Liberal feminists genuinely feel that it's femininity that's oppressed, not femaleness, and even when  it comes to issues of pregnancy and menstruation and abortion, they manage to spin it into a statistical coincidence since most ""pregnant people"" are also feminine and that's why they're not taken seriously. They fail to grasp the material connection between human reproduction and oppression, and instead think women are oppressed because they're inherently more soft-spoken or more sensitive or some such tosh."

5392,"I feel the same. I don't hate trans people, and I know a lot of people with legitimate gender dysphoria that are just as sick and tired of this crap as we are.

The thing is, your biological sex can't be changed. That's just a fact. You can change your hormones and get surgery to physically appear like the opposite sex, but you can't ever 100% be the opposite sex. I can understand why that might be hard for people with gender dysphoria to hear, but as the saying goes ""facts don't care about your feelings"".

It may only be a symbol, yeah, but it does feel like a subtle way of saying ""your existence is not inclusive"". No one should feel like they have to be excluded in order to include everyone else, that just defeats the purpose of ""inclusivity"", but no one who speaks about ""inclusiveness"" really even seems to care about actual inclusiivity anyway, it seems to be more of a power tactic.

I think the issue with a lot of this trans and woke stuff in general nowadays is that we're expected to coddle other people. We're expected to tell everyone they're ""valid"" and nod and agree with everything they do and say, and never criticising them no matter what they do. It's honestly kind of depressing, especially since so many of these people seem to rely their entire self worth and self esteem on other people as a result, instead of having their own self worth and integrity like self confident people should."
5393,"No one wants to make Trans men's life harder, so to answer your question ""what do we do?"" We treat them with kindness and respect. I've never met a trans man or woman and in the event that I did I would treat them with just as much affability and consideration as I afford everyone else. 

If the female symbol is on a product I use and a trans man has decided that this makes life harder, then that is the trans man's problem and I wish the trans man luck In sorting it out."
5394,">but in your soul you‚Äôre a man and you want to live accordingly

I really think that sentence needs to unpacked and examined a little bit. A man is an adult male of our species. So the assertion is that, in the soul of an adult female, they are *really* the sex whose normal development includes the small, motile gamete? That doesn't make much sense. How does distress over sex characteristics differ from the myriad other distresses, sometimes extremely severe, that center on various other body characteristics? Does an anorexic have the ""soul"" of an undernourished person? Does someone suffering body integrity disorder have the ""soul"" of an amputee? Are we suggesting and accepting that body characteristics have non-corporeal realities?

What does to ""live as a man"" mean? Does it mean liking certain things, doing certain activities? That is the sort of restrictive sex roles feminists have been fighting against forever. Or does it just mean being *perceived* as a man? And why would that be? Is it that men get more respect? That they are less under threat of sexual violence? That they are not subject to systemic sexism? Is it simply an attempt to not be treated as women are treated in our society? And if it's not that, then what could it possibly be?

As far as I can tell, you can only arrive at such an insistence by believing rigid, damaging ideals about what a woman can be, or by trying to escape the rigid, damaging ideals society imposes on women. What else is there?"

5431,"> I don't see why people who deny sex as a material reality can't say the same.

Because different biology between the sexes necessitates different treatment to begin with, and also reinforces a power gap between them. With some very marginal exceptions, this is simply not true of ""races"", which are artificial constructs. For example, higher rates of sickle cell anemia in black people vs higher rates of cancer in people who live in certain areas because they were historically black and thus used as a dumping ground for carcinogens. In the case of disparities like sickle cell, there's not really a need to address it in a racialized way apart from making sure that there's racial justice in healthcare access and population-porportionate spending on research; in the case of the latter, it's racially linked because of racism, but not biology. Sex is vastly, vastly different in that sense. Maleness and femaleness are genuine material realities that persist completely outside of any human systems of oppression based upon them, and are inherent and permanent features of our biology.

I'm not sure whether this is your actual stance or you're just playing devil's advocate, but either way, it's based on a false equivalence."
5432,"Simple: imagine a world with magically no racism‚Äînone. And no lingering generational effects of racism. It‚Äôs magic. Are black people still at a disadvantage overall?

But white peoples are more at risk of skin cancer and more susceptible to malaria so it evens out. 

Now imagine a world without sexism. No other changes, just no sexism or misogyny. Are females still at a disadvantage? We‚Äôre still smaller, on average, and weaker. We still get pregnant and bear children with all those inherent risks and responsibilities. We still menstruate with all that entails. We still have boobs that get in the way. And we still create new lives, so regardless of how egalitarian our society is, there are going to be feelings about that."

Also how can you identify as a class if you disbelieve the quality you have in common? An organization of/for black people cannot be assembled if the same people don't believe in race. 

Back to your question, if you deny the premise, how can you accurately address the oppression when the cause will be attributed to something else?

A racist oppressor who claims he doesn't believe in race will rationalize his racist action of being rude to the sole table of Asians in his restaurant because he notices ""they were noisier than others"" even if untrue/selective observation. The Asians at that table, who don't believe in race, will attribute it to being noisy despite only 2 peoplel, even if the next tables were noisier and that they seem to be ""noisy"" in a lot of restaurants in this specific ""we're totes not xenophobic!!"" town. Status quo will never address racism.  

Debatable materiality of race aside, let's go with one that we agree is real, like sex, but disbelieved-- gravity. Can someone who disbelieves in gravity expect to survive a leap from a cliff? Will his life be oppressed (paraplegic), yes, but he'll attribute it to not flapping his arms fast enough. Or medical facts-- a pregnant woman who doesn't believe alcohol affects the fetus and guzzles down 4 liters of vodka a day will have a baby with FAS with brain damage-- she'll attribute it to that one time she fell off her couch and bumped her belly... then proceeds to have two more children with FAS.

The danger is that self-sacrificing women are perfect foot soldiers who obey orders, no matter how criminal those orders are. The hope is that these women, upset by internal conflicts that cannot be stilled by manipulation, challenged by the clarifying drama of public confrontation and dialogue, will be forced to articulate the realities of their own experiences as women subject to the will of men. In doing so, the anger that necessarily arises from a true perception of how they have been debased may move them beyond the fear that transfixes them to a meaningful rebellion against the men who in fact diminish, despise, and terrorize them. This is the common struggle of all women, whatever their male-defined ideological origins; and this struggle alone has the power to transform women who are enemies against one another into allies fighting for individual and collective survival that is not based on self-loathing, fear, and humiliation, but instead on self-determination, dignity, and authentic integrity."

Race and ethnicity are very different things. The old school theory of race based on superficial clusters of physical traits has no legitimate biological basis. I don't deny that there are numerous related Concepts that have bases in biology.

 I'm sorry just to cite an article to explain myself, but I'm honestly a little weary of this discussion, it generated quite a bit of attention. [For an explanation why I say traditional races are not based in biology see the section on does race exist in the Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/race/)

>You can't not believe the premise then use it as a shield or class commonality at the same time.

I don't understand what this means. Can you clarify?"
5464,"Race, at least the ""traditional"" races, has no basis in biology. [This is not a contentious view](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/race/) Edit- fixed link

Our modern concept of race has as its main basis the white supremacist pseudoscience of the early modern period, though it has roots as"

5468,Holy fucking Christ on a raft.
5469,Christ on a cracker. Medical professionals need to stop entertaining this shit ASAP.
5470,You‚Äôve given me some food for thought. Thanks.
5471,"> There's nothing stopping someone who holds this opinion from saying that oppression based on the contruct/fiction is real.

Well, that's easy enough to counter then, right? Basically, if they don't believe sex is real and the basis for sexism/sex discrimination, they obviously should not have a problem with all prostate cancer research being performed on trans men, etc etc.

The point of debate and rhetoric isn't to actually work out a platonic idea of the truth through some kind of human error checking routine, basically. I don't know why GC as a whole seems to think falling for stupid neckbeard games is like, an actual necessity. Who cares how many angels some woke smartass think dance on the head of a pin? After a certain point, sophistry is just sophistry, only winning move is not to play etc."
5472,">  I agree that treating sex as a fiction or construct is problematic. 

Only ""problematic""?  It's absolute reality denying insanity."
5473,"I'm not black, but I'm not white either. Race exists in our culture and therefore our lives. Pretending it's not there is fruitless."
5474,"I agree with you there. This is why it *does* track, for me: gender is to sex as race is to physical variations such as skin colour. 

A clunky attempt at expansion follows:

People from different regions on the planet look different, that's a material reality. Race is a social construct used to control and subordinate people with certain features (ie dark skin) to benefit others with certain features (ie white skin). Racism is the practice of this. Human physical variation exists: race isn't real but racism is.

People are either male or female and those two have certain reproductive capabilities, that's a material reality. Gender roles are a social construct used to control and subordinate people with certain  reproductive capabilities (females, the people who can gestate and birth young) to benefit others with certain biology (males, people who can only impregnate). Sexism is the practice of this. Biological sex exists:  gender isn't real but sexism is.

Unlike sexism which is restricted to a hierarchy of two, racism has loads of hierarchies because people have loads of variations. So racism can be much more complex."
5475,I‚Äôm sure you can abstract all real issues into philosophical drivel but it doesn‚Äôt solve anything.
5476,"I don‚Äôt think race exists technically. It‚Äôs really just a bastardization of ethnicity that was warped into a concept in order to justify slavery. ‚ÄúThe black race‚Äù was created by early doctors who thought black people were more suited to be chattel because their ‚Äúskulls were smaller‚Äù and ‚Äúlungs were weaker.‚Äù It was created to justify segregation. It completely didn‚Äôt need to exist.

Now though, we‚Äôre stuck with it, and racism is a thing. It‚Äôs not based on our ‚Äúrace,‚Äù no, but our ethnicity. I don‚Äôt care what people call it personally, I just want people to stop assuming shit about me because of the way I was born.

This is the same view we need to have on sex. Whether or not you think it‚Äôs dimorphic, immutable, total bullshit, people of a certain sex are disproportionately murdered and dehumanized because of something they can‚Äôt change entirely. You can take hormones and shift it all you‚Äôd like, but the world has been set up to promote one and debase the other.

Most people aren‚Äôt paying attention to how exactly you line up within one previously determined category of biological sex. They‚Äôre trying to figure out if you‚Äôre a man or a woman so they can decide how to treat you, and that‚Äôs what we should be focusing on."
5477,"you totally seemed to have missed my point entirely... thats exactly what i was pointing out. that people vary by skin color, which is just biological fact, but that race is a social construct, a group of actual traits that do exist, but which are subjectively grouped together for the benefit of another social group.  just like every gendered trait is a trait that people actually possess, but which is grouped together subjectively for the benefit of another group."
5478,Sorry. You're drawing an analogy to race with the idea that the *sex* example is flawed because you believe race doesn't exist. I'm saying the logic doesn't carry over to sex.
5479,"I was thinking of Jewish and NA people when I mentioned ethnicity.

I am aware of the arguments saying an individual's race is not strictly dictated by biology (e.g. how much melanin you have validates if you're black or not), but as a class, I'd say it is defined by it, by genetics and ancestral lineage specifically. Similar to Native American tracing of ancestry to avail of government resources exclusive to them.  Otherwise, if race isn't real, Dolezal is as black as any person and shouldn't have been kicked out of NAACP. In fact, there shouldn't even be NAACP to begin with if race has no material basis. 

>I don't understand what this means. Can you clarify?

A nonbinary may not disbelieve bio sex, but then claim it is sexism/because she's female and is why, in her IT team of all men and her, only she got a 2% salary increase and everyone else got 5%. 

And like I mentioned, you cannot say race isn't real, but applaud the Business Mentorship Program for Black Women as valid. By your logic, there is no such thing as black women, no such thing as subclass based on race, all women should be able to avail of the program."

I don't think sex is BS, so I wouldn't know how they'd respond. I only made the modest point that disbelieving is sex does not *necessitate* disbelieving in sexism... It is a *coherent* position to believe that sexism is based on a fiction or construct...

And I don't quite follow your second paragraph, I certainly don't think attempting to offer our strongest arguments and participating in self-critique is sophistry"
5483,Agreed
5484,"I dont think it is a question whether race exists or not,  but whether it exists as a social construct or a biological reality."
5485,Yes race exists in our society. But it doesn't exist as a biological category. That was my whole point...
5486,"dworkin put it very succinctly: ""gender is real, but its not true"". she said its true that a system of oppression exists based on one's biological sex, but its not true that people are psychologically or mentally predisposed to certain behaviors just based on that fact alone.  its putting the cart before the horse to say ""see! men and women act different and thats because of their sex organs!""  no, its more like ""men and women act different because even before they are born they are immediately tracked into a gender role upon first learning their sex""."
5487,"Actually getting clear on the nature of race is VERY important to combatting racism. Racial antinaturalism was paramount in defeating the scientific racism of the 19th century. 

In the same way, sexual naturalism is very important to defeating the nonsense that is trans ideology. 

You can stick your nose up at philosophy all you want but this shit matters as does offering *good arguments against our opponents*, which is why I criticized the argument presented"
5488,Do you take any of this to conflict with what I wrote? I don't see any disagreement here.
5489,"I apologize for misunderstanding your point,  but I'm not sure why you said I have a fundamental misunderstanding of race, gender and sex then. We entirely agree apparently.

Race is at best a social construct based on superficial clusters of physical traits and histories. In that sense, race doesn't exist as a biological category. However that doesn't stop us from recognizing racism is a real and serious problem. That's all I ever claimed"
5490,"Sigh... all I'm saying is that the **attitude** one takes towards race is also possible to be taken towards sex if one believes it to be a construct. People who deny sex are not logically necessitated into denying sexism. 

That's it. I'm not claiming that sex and race are analogous. I'm not claiming that sex doesn't exist. All of this is knee jerk uncharitable interpretation by people on this thread"
5491,I agree with you.
5492,"They wouldn't really believe in racism, though. They'd believe in discrimination based on others' faulty perception of a false idea. So saying someone who doesn't believe in race believes in true 'racism' is misleading."
5493,Ah thanks for the clarification!
5494,"I don't follow why you think that. Why does the truth of race have anything to do with whether people are treated differently on the basis of it?

Race doesn't have to be a legitimate biological category for oppression to be based on it.

To use another example. Caste is truly a social construct with no biological basis. But people are absolutely oppressed on the basis of their position in a caste system"
5495,"Someone who doesn't believe in race would think people are being treated differently *not* on the basis of race, but on the basis of *other people faultily believing in a nonexistent concept*. [This distinction doesn't negate the person from seeing the resulting *oppression* as real regardless]"
5496,"No, they are being oppressed on their race, which is a fiction imposed on them by others... Race ""exists"", just not as a genuine biological category. That's still racism. 

The idea that race (at least the ""traditional"" races) has a biological basis is almost unheard of in modern philosophical and scientific circles. [You can read here for more info](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/race/)"
5497,"So, if you define race as a 'fiction', then what you're saying is that they believe in fiction-based oppression rather than race-based oppression.

And I'm making no claims one way or the other if race as we define it is real.

But to go back to the actual point of the post-- people who think *sex* is fiction are therefore believing in fiction-based oppression rather than sex-based oppression as we define sex. So I don't consider the term 'sexism' to be genuine by those using it to actually mean fiction-ism."

5501,I first saw the Incels video and actually thought it was pretty good; and then I liked his other videos but got creeped out at how overly sexual they were.   The last straw was when I saw the video about TERFS and him saying he would rather be ornamental then useful.

5507,Ironically it wasn't Contra that tipped me off in the first place but it's kinda what cemented it. For some stupid reason Contra is viewed as an authority. Ask basically anything about trans people and gender and you'll be directed to Contra. Really gotta question why no one wants to just coherently explain their ideas instead of directing you to a low-substance video that has about 50 layers of humor and costume tacked on it. It's the same thing that sent me away from religion. Why explain your beliefs when you could just quote the bible?

5511,"I hope one day to write a post on GC that makes Nick Parrot cry.

One of the (many) things that really pisses me off about Nick William Parrot is that an actual woman, even with the porn attire and drag makeup, would NEVER, EVER, get a sliver of the attention he does for his quarter assed ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù channel. 

If she were to dress the way Nick Parrot dresses she wouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously for a half a second. If she were to make the childish emotionally based ‚Äúpoints‚Äù that he makes in the vast majority of his videos she would be chewed to pieces by the Internet, not praised as a messiah.

Nick Parrot is not a particularly smart man. He was born into a wealthy family, he had an education that allowed him to posture and pretend he‚Äôs intelligent, but Nick doesn‚Äôt have any actual ideas of his own. 

He may be an empty husk of a man, but he is smart enough to understand, deep down, how much of a fraud he is. 

That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs still so unhappy even with all the attention and praise he receives. That‚Äôs why going on r/gendercritical ‚Äúmakes him cry‚Äù. It‚Äôs not because some women use the t slur and talk about his huge man hands (which by the way are huge indeed Nick you don‚Äôt pass), it‚Äôs because the women on here see straight through him. 

That‚Äôs what kills him, it is the refusal to submit to his fantasy that he is a Natalie Portmanesque waif of a genius, and not an aging, porn addicted, botched, talentless, mediocre man who tried to turn into his sex fantasy but wont be able to keep up the facade much longer :)"
5512,"> Hey Nick*

5520,The moment that made me peak trans was when I watched the part of Contra's Gender Critical video where he mocked the idea about abolishing gender. That's when I wanted to find out what you were all about.
5521,"I used to follow him in the heyday of the YouTube atheist community when he had a few thousand subscribers. I remember the porn livestreams, his naive sexism, his pretentious aloofness, and that footage of him at an atheist meet-up where he got ridiculously drunk and had to be babysat by his friends, one of whom I think was his girlfriend for a while (a much more popular video maker at the time). He seemed socially awkward and a little bit sad. He disappeared, as did most of the rest of that community. 

When he came back as Contra, he made a couple of interesting videos and I wasn‚Äôt at all surprised that he was still a vainglorious aesthete but at least a little more sophisticated than before. Now the cultured pretty boy has truly come into his own. He‚Äôs the perfect face for the trans movement - he‚Äôs shallow, cynical, superficially charming and clever enough to fool stupid people into thinking he‚Äôs a genius. Thanks to the generosity of his followers, he can finally afford to be the libertine he aspired to be when he was twenty. But he‚Äôs still a sad, now rapidly ageing, nerd who has peaked in popularity. I don‚Äôt think his story will end well. I don‚Äôt wish ill on him, but he‚Äôs a woman-hating prick so I don‚Äôt wish him good, either. I think self-destruction is part of his ultimate goal, and will be curated beautifully, I‚Äôm sure."

Also, how typical of a man to mock menstruation. Is period shaming on the woke agenda now too?"
5524,"Be sure to check out Terri Strange's youtube channel. Nick sent her porn  to troll her back when he merely used a fake voice to sound smart (as opposed to his fake voice he uses now to sound female).

But now it seems that every video lately involves more navel-gazing and obsession with very narrow issues. The last four videos are all mostly related to trans content and the particular issues with which Contra is struggling in the moment. Before, Contra talked about racism, fascism, cultural appropriation, toxic masculinity, things which impact people on a much larger scale. And now it's just stuff like ... plastic surgery? Pronouns? And angry feminists who hate trans people? And the conclusions are so wrong, or based on such incorrect assumptions, that it then makes me question the content of every other video which I previously liked."
5544,"I really loved Contrapoints‚Äô video about incels and found some fascinating insights there.

Contrapoints‚Äô video on Gender Critical was really bad and neglected to address the issues that made me GC; like cotton ceiling rhetoric, trans women in women‚Äôs sports, and trans bullying of women who have the audacity to refer to their own reproductive anatomy  ( the bullying of women who wear pussy hats to the women‚Äôs march is what peaked me)

As a side note Contra acted out a TERF character in the GC video who was like a Wiccan earth goddess rad fem and I honestly started liking and identifying more with the parody character than Contra ."
5545,"I also found the GC movement when she mentioned this subreddit in her vid. I checked it bc I was curious and went back to it frequently, until I fully peaked.

I envisioned they would just exist separately until I rewatched Gender Critical. And I just didn‚Äôt agree with her logic.

That's why I'm disappointed. What happened to steelmanning? Jordan Peterson, incels, the alt-right, even the fucking golden one got a fairer shake than transmeds and and rad fems in your most recent videos. 

One specific example: In Transtrenders, Tiffany Tumbles says that she's trans because she has a gender dysphoria dx. The counter (contra?) argument? Gender dysphoria wasn't recognized until 2013! Ha! Except, (1) that's not how medical diagnoses work and even if it was, (2) gender dysphoria was just called gender identity disorder before then. That's just one of many. Are arguments that shitty supposed to actually convince anyone? I thought you were better than that. The quality and strength of your arguments has dropped. You're just preaching to the choir at this point.

5566,"After years of being a libfem and arguing with ""horrible TERFs"", I was called the T-word myself when one of my opinions didn't fall perfectly in line with TRA views. Never mind that a huge variety of views in the trans community exist ‚Äì it's easier to just call a woman a slur and shut her down than to engage in a difficult conversation. Because of that, I came here to validate that my views weren't ""TERFy"", and (oops!) found I agree with gender critical thinking. I was able to reconcile all the uneasy feelings I had from woke feminism's views about  porn, sex work, sex positivity, bdsm, etc. This isn't just about trans issues ‚Äì as much as the hater subs like to focus on that exclusively¬†‚Äì there are many places where liberal feminism is pure cognitive dissonance."

5569,"oh wow. apparently his old youtube account, back when he was just a sexist straight white male from a bougie background, got banned because he sent unsolicited porn to a feminist he hated. he also used to livestream videos of himself reading lesbian erotica and masturbating lol its absurd to me how he‚Äôs an authority in the left. ive lost faith in the left and mainstream lib publications since i found out about him."
5570,he‚Äôs one of the internet‚Äôs worst mysoginists. somebody recently posted about how he fantasizes becoming a sexually submissive fifties housewife. it pissed me off so much it inspired this post
5571,"I remember the incel one was the first i watched too. I think it was shared in this sub.
> saying he would rather be ornamental then useful.

The problem for me is that there are so many characters (or counterpoints) he shows we don't really get to know what his viewpoints are.

edit: We need to stop giving him views. Does anyone know of a react channel? I know there is Terri Strange, magda Berns, Leah Tverly, Peachy Yoghurt, and King Ar-Pharaz√¥n have covered Contrapoints. Heck, even Carl benjamin has, but there doesn't seem to be any dedicated react channels."

5580,Ditto to everything you said. Hell theres even so much outside of trans stuff and contrapoints that's thinly veiled misogyny masquerading as new feminism. Really sickens me every day because it just puts us woken down further than where we started

5589,">He may be an empty husk of a man, but he is smart enough to understand, deep down, how much of a fraud he is.

This hits the nail on the head. 

I see him as an entertainer first and foremost. He clearly understand the GC view, but is so obsessed with using the things he reads on here to twist the truth and use it to profit. He's great at being manipulative and cherry-picking, then molding his videos into true devices of witty persuasion for the intellectually weak. 

The #1 thing that indicates he's still a man is the fact that he's able to take what we say here and use it against us, with zero emotional connection to what we feel. It's pretty typical of many men in general---they try to logically understand, but they'll always fall short of honest emotional empathy, instead choosing to reduce women into one-dimensional caricatures."

i also had a lot of doubts about sex work and sex positivity that i thought were me just not being ‚Äúliberated‚Äù enough lol turns out it was just me being more liberated than i thought"
5604,"yeah, men who no one would give the time of day to before are now suddenly famous for being women...."
5605,yeah!! that was soooo weird. he made it seem like abolishing gender meant getting rid of all fashion statements and personality traits. thats so bizarre. abolishing gender means that nail polish and heels and long hair are no longer associated w womanhood or manhood. jeez

5607,"Lol so being 30=""rapidly aging""??? ü§î"
5608,Yes because misogyny and inherent beliefs about women are always the things that can unite men across political boundaries.  Ten years ago the backlash against feminism was what turned previously democratically aligned men republican.  It's the same old shit.
5609,There's all these really bizarre stories in more mainstream left circles about how he saving males from fascism. Heard one a few days ago on NPR. I think they're really desperate to push the popularity of breadtube and Contra is the biggest draw
5610,yeah that's how he advertises himself but is it actually happening
5611,IIRC he attracted that neo-Nazi audience long before he began identifying as trans. From whom would ‚Äúhigh brow‚Äù neoNazis be more likely to contenance any criticism than a pseudo-intellectual white man?
5612,"Yes, There was an NPR spot with him on it about just his. I posted about it and encouraged people to get in touch with WNYC (the New York City NPR station) and let them know what a bullshit move it is to have a misogynist, TRA, former MRA advocating anything.  This was about a week (?) two weeks (?) ago.  The show was All Things Considered - you can go to the WNYC website, find the segment and listen. I couldn't get through the whole thing, but, by all means, listen to as much as you can the contact WNYC and tell them what you think. I sure did."

I think from what I've read that Contra is a mess anyway. I felt sorry for him in one of his videos where he talked about dissociating when having sex. Something's not right there. And apparently he really does drink and take recreational drugs a lot and probably is severely screwing with his body even beyond the surgeries."

* ""I'm not an anti-feminist, that's offensive. I'm just gender-affirming/""gender-euphoric"", even though gender is literally what male supremacists put in place to force women to look and behave differently from men.

Jesus I don't even like r/GC that much but watching anti-feminists irrationally try and justify their woman hatred with the ""YOU ARE A TERF"" shit is hilarious, and again literally akin to Nazis.

We have been programmed to be constantly aware of our ""flaws"" and the ""cures"" are sold back to us at great expense.

The most frustrating part for me is every time I tried to argue points or ask questions, I'd get frozen or deleted or banned by moderators.

It's even comical that he's actually trying to teach socialism to his audience lol

But now that I've watched the video, just *uh*. It's even worse than I thought. Calling revolution to fascism can only mean he doesn't even understand basic marxist concepts. It's not a revolution when you're fighting to keep the status quo, and specially by using the most repressive means, actually fighting off a revolution. That's reaction, counter-revolution.
He's just a poser."

I'm not even saying it's wrong to have that type of aesthetics. It's just alienating.

Yup, it's crazy how many TERF terrorists are in the news now for attacks and shootings. We need to address this epidemic of female violence! Oh wait. That doesn't fucking happen.

Please, enlighten us to any case of a terrorist attack or plot that can be traced specifically to gender critical feminism."
5741,"As much as people here ""take back"" ""TERFs"", it's really not a reactionary movement. It's second-wave feminism applied to the 21st century. The idea that women need their own spaces/orgs is 50 or 100+ years old depending on how you want to count, before ""trans"" was a sparkle in someone's underwear. It's like saying Stoicism is a reaction to Nihilism.

""TERF"" is much more akin to ""queer"", in that some people are offended by it because it's a vehicle for hate and violence, some people adopt the phrase as a form of resistance. To really believe the acronym describes a political group, you'd have to believe that feminists organize to ""exclude"" trans people specifically, which is clearly false. Feminists get together to exclude men, of which TIMs are a subset. This shows that ""TERF"" is a word authored from the TIM perspective, not the female. It literally centers men and erased women outside of their relationship with men. Hence: www.terfisaslur.com

Since Nazis are on your mind so much, I'd be curious to hear of a specific example of Nazi-like propaganda you've come across, and then also include a political group you support, which you're certain they never do such a thing."

5769,"i can easily say: you may consider yourself a leftist, but your politics are misogynistic"
5770,"i feel like this is really easy to say when you live in a country where you can just ‚Äúidentify‚Äù out of womanhood. in most countries outside of the west, women are women because they have vaginas and can potentially produce life. women are oppressed because they have vaginas and wombs, because they menstruate, because they can have miscarriages, because they can abort fetuses, because they are physically smaller and thus more fragile. its these physical qualities that make them oppressed. these are qualities that no one chooses. its not just ‚Äúnot male,‚Äù and in fact, thats a very typically sexist view. the whole male is the default and female is just an afterthought (that kind of thinking comes from the patriarch‚Äôs manual: the bible, eve being a simple extension of adam‚Äîthe default human). 

you are a male. maybe you recognize that, but youre drawn to femininity. nothing wrong w liking feminine things at all. but youre literally mansplaining To Me, someone who was Born a Woman, what it means to be a woman. its not a special little feeling. its not about wanting to twirl in a dress. its not about opting out of maleness just because the expectations of manhood are too much, as if womanhood is Life on ‚Äúeasy mode‚Äù (which is what a lot of you seem to think).

im going to assume youre relatively young. truly, deeply examine what this path really means to you. oftentimes people transition to escape from mental illness. nick is a perfect example of that. i have anxiety disorders too. i am gender noncomforming too. but i respect that my body is my body is my body. gender isnt real. sex is something i didnt choose. the only real difference between male and female is biological; beyond that, anyone can be as masculine or feminine as they want.

just stop calling yourselves female and stop coming into lesbian and female only spaces and demanding equal treatment. female only spaces and lesbians exist to get away from penises. bodies are real. gender isnt. so plain, simple, and logical."

5778,"I mean in regards to the whole male being default, I meant it as a bad thing. simone de beauvoir said that women are defined by their relation to men. Women are called the imperfect men and even Aristotle said some high key sexiest shit about women, which one can possit this line of patriarchal thinking is just deeply rooted in western thought. I hope one day we don't identify women by their biological abilities or organs because that would women who had their uterus removed for medical reseaons wouldn't be considered a women and that's messed up. 
I've never met a trans girl who has ever said that being a girl is life on easy mode, I've seen a lot of male cringelords who say that though and I'm more a pants/tight person I got scars on my legs I wanna hide. 
I did't think I was explaining anything in a condescending manner, you asked me what I thought it meant to be female and I answered with what I think it is.

You talk about choices, women not shaving their legs or deciding not to wear ""feminine"" clothes, and I can't believe you dont realize how much of that is a superficial and privileged view. I don't fucking care about having support about not shaving, I care about being able to wear clothes that won't land me a heatstroke and not being leered at or even harrassed, I care about not being asked I have children in my job interviews, I care about women not being able to have a goddamn abortion in my fucking third world country without risking jail time or dying in one of those clandestine clinics, I care about not being afraid of going out after dark because the most that can happen to me isn't simply having my phone and wallet robbed, I care about not having to think I can't be sitting in an aisle seat when I take the bus because some dude may want to rub on me, I care about not having to deal with dudes that can't understand I just want to play a game without being hit on or hearing my place is in the kitchen after being repeatedly turned down, I care about my fucking president saying that he had a daughter after a bunch of sons because he had a moment of weakness, I care about not having to constantly have my earphones on when I'm out so dudes will leave me the fuck alone. I could keep going, but I want to be clear I don't fucking care about shaving."
5784,"i dont have the energy to reply to most of what you said but i will say this: i am sick and tired of trans rights activists using women who no longer hace uteruses to say ‚Äúwell she doesnt have a uterus so she‚Äôs not a woman either.‚Äù 

what an awful, ignorant and disgusting counterpoint.

a woman who has to undergo a hysterectomy and lose her uterus is still 100% a woman, because that surgical experience and its aftermath is 100% tied to her womanhood. my aunt had a hysterectomy last week after suffering for decades with endometriosis. she was never able to have children and everytime she got her period‚Äîwhich TiMs also claim to have just cuz HRT gives them cramps lol; that, or they fetishize it‚Äîshe would experience excruciating pain and an extremely heavy blood flow, so debilitating she couldnt leave her home. do you know how many women suffer from endometriosis? 1 in 10. they might be infertile. they might have to have their uterus or ovaries removed, but they are still women, because those are real women‚Äôs issues. they are not menstruators or uterus-havers‚Äîthey are WOMEN. 

i know TiMs don‚Äôt see older women as real women but those are women too. my mother in law had to get a mastectomy after breast cancer diagnosis. my mom is going through menopause right now, which comes w horrifying symptoms. they are still women. those are women‚Äôs issues. you would not understand."

5788,"TERF was coined by libfem/funfem TigTog, a male kowtowing blogger, specifically as a slur against radical feminists.  Its original use was as a way to pigeonhole and demonize women who prioritized female liberation and the fight against male supremacy and refused to get on our knees for males and chanting the holy catachisms ""Transwomen are Women"" and ""Feminism is for Everybody"".  It was then popularized by such internet Trans Luminaries as Char the Butcher (an actual self professed Nazi, also originator of ""Die Cis Scum""), Gender Bitch (Infamous for blogging about torturing a black radfem with acid, among MANY other women hating fantasies), Jos Triutt (who took over as editor of feministing and immediately began to purge women who stuck up for the rights of actual female humans), and of course the lovely Julia Serano who thinks that reproductive sovereignty focused feminism is transphobic because he feels it is ""alienating"" to him as an ""infertile woman"".  So no it was not coined by radical feminists, TERF has always been a term used against us by misogynists who hate the fact that there are women who are willing to name the problem of male violence and refuse to shut up about it.  Mary Mother of Kittens, the level of historical revisionism you fuckers propagate is as bad as the most craven of the patriarchal religions.  Take your lies elsewhere dick worshipper."

Even now we don't even totally agree on how these laws should be worded, considering they want to codify gender stereotypes into law just as much as TRAs; they just want to legally prevent anyone from switching because they're furious that trans are ""cheating"" God out of his assigned role for them.

5895,"I don't know anything about Ayaan Hirsi, but I do know that we will need lots of sane people from across the political spectrum to work together on this. Hell, maybe defeating the trans cult could be the one thing that makes left and right sit at the same table and start trying to understand one another better!"

5899,"It struck me last night that JK is in a similar position as Harry was in Order of the Phoenix, yet these bullies and psychopaths have the nerve to call her Umbridge. I have to laugh at their lack of self-awareness. I really, really hope she sticks by this and doesn‚Äôt issue an apology. We need her."

5909,"I've always admired her. She's been through hell, wrote a book about it. Become a politician, speak truth to power, vilified, smeared, threaten with violence. Yet still she persist. Brave and stunning."
5910,I read a tweet where she said ‚Äúi already have your money bye‚Äù.
5911,"My personal heroine, Ayaan. I'm so fucking glad she exists. Besides radical Islamists that want her dead, the Left has been trying to guilt trip her into silence for decades now. The way they threw her under the bus to support another patriarchal institution, Islam, woke me up to their total hypocrisy on women's rights.  The Right only supported her more as a pawn to use against all Muslim immigration without actually considering how she herself is a perfect model of immigration. 
Women are really alone politically, and I hope we all realize it sooner.

5917,Why were you down voted? Right now the animus toward Rowling is completely non-proportional and it feels like people could not possibly be actually reading her tweet.
5918,It's crazy. I think it's because this is seen as supporting an evil TERF rsther than viewed for what it is. Or saying sex is real is seen as a terven dog whistle or something. The level of the backlash is way out of proportion.

I don't want to go too far off topic, but I feel I need to comment on this: This is not ""literally just what she said"". Rather, she claimed that she never actually said Hermione was white. Which is a load of crap. The character was described as white at one point in the books (which people online immediately took a picture of and posted, of course) and her own early drawings of the main characters also showed her as white.

I have no issue whatsoever with them casting a black actress for that part, but why does this have to include insulting everyone's intelligence by claiming something that is very clearly wrong? Why not just say that the character was originally imagined as white, but that she wholeheartedly supports this casting choice as well?

So yeah. Criticism fully deserved for this move. (Again: not for the casting choice in itself, but for claiming the character was never clearly meant to be white.)"

I think what she was trying to say was that she likes fans bringing their own interpretations to her work. Not that Hermione had originally been conceived as a black girl.

It's a clear, bullshit double standard. A man can compete with women despite a clear, objective advantage.

It could be a lot of womens' last chance to compete in their careers; that'd be hard to give up.

What they need to do is organize and become vocal before that drastic a step is necessary. If they threaten to boycott well in advance then they might nip the issue in the bud. Unfortunately even finely-tuned athletic women are permeated with socialized niceness and compassion so many are willing to be martyrs if they think it means making a positive change in the world."

And it must be very difficult for female athletes to even discuss these issues together and decide on a strategy to speak out against or combat the unfairness as we have seen how difficult it is for women to find any 'space' to come together and even discuss the effects these issues- even wanting to have a dialogue is labelled as transphobic, and the consequences of that can be devastating."

6055,"If you could somehow measure strength or performance instead of size, and then lump competitors in groups based on that, then yes, you could have a class where men and women of equal strength compete together. But accurately measuring a person's strength is difficult. And in a way we already have a system where people compete against people of the same capacity, it's called qualifiers and lower tier competitions. If you removed sex segregation and just had performance-based classes, you would have women populating the lower performance classes and men nearly exclusively controlling the higher performance classes. And I'm willing to bet good money that in the absolute top tier you would see no women at all. 

Problem is, men have a much greater potential for strength and performance when training is applied. Look at records in almost all sports for men and women and you will find that women's records lag behind considerably. If you take running competitions for men and women and slap them together, you won't get a bunch of men and women running together for similar placements, with somewhat stronger representation of men in the top 10% than women. You will get a bunch of men running, then a small group of slow men and very fast women running together IF you're lucky, and at the tail there will be the great majority of women runners. Now, personally I understand why the women runners aren't interested in being put in that position."
6056,"If sex classes are erased from sports, there won't be ""less women"" at high levels. There will be almost no women at high levels. Sport will effectively cease to be an option for women, except as a recreational thing. The difference in male and female performance is more than significant across the board, especially at high levels. Sexes aren't separated in sport ""somehow"", they are separated for very specific reasons relating to performance. It's not about being inspired, it's about physiological differences. 

This is of course even without considering the issue of contact sports, where women would risk serious injury if they were expected to play with men. 

There are a handful of sports where women can compete on an equal level with men, e.g. shooting and show jumping. But those sports are the exception, because they are sports where the physical strength or size of the competitor is much less important than in normal sports."

This is purely curiosity on my part. I know those who were born men that are now women in every sense of the word except their internal organs and not having XY chromosomes. They would get stared at a lot in a men‚Äôs washroom and it might even be dangerous for them depending on where they were.

6095,">except their internal organs and not having XY chromosomes.

What is your definition of a woman? Because mine is having women‚Äôs internal organs and XX chromosomes. Everything else is literally made up by society. 

It sounds to me like your definition of a woman is someone who wears feminine clothing and enjoys feminine things and I cannot think of a more offensive definition. Being a woman has nothing to do with feelings or clothes or preferences. Society told us girls like pink and glitter and we followed, but girls existed apart from boys before pink and glitter did. Women were raped and killed by men simply for being women before pink and glitter existed. 

Those ‚Äúwomen‚Äù you‚Äôre talking about are men who decided they didn‚Äôt like or do the things society *told* them to do. They are going against *society* not biology. They‚Äôre gender non-conforming, but their sex is still male. 

The fact that men will become violent towards someone who is not like them is not women‚Äôs problem. But the fact that men have been using their size and strength against women for millennia is women‚Äôs problem. If men won‚Äôt accept their own, the women‚Äôs bathroom should not be their refuge, because the women‚Äôs bathroom is a refuge and safe space for *women,* the ones with female internal organs and XX chromosomes, the ones that are at a physical disadvantage and in a vulnerable position (as in with their pants literally down). To allow a person with the build and possibly genitalia of a man puts every woman in the bathroom at a physical disadvantage and it is no longer a safe place for women."
6096,Women are also a protected class. Transwomen still exhibit male pattern violence. We should not have to give up our right to safety and privacy.
6097,That's an issue you need to sort out with men. There's no reason to put women at risk because men are violent towards other men.

If it quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, and feels like a duck - then it‚Äôs a duck. 

How would anyone even know who was born what way?  

This is an honest question. Will there be a blood test before entering this bathroom? No. 

The sign does nothing. 

Except maybe stop some actual predators who pretend to be women (or lie and say they identify as women) from perpetrating what should be considered an assault. If a strait male goes into a female washroom for nefarious reasons that‚Äôs wrong. I agree with that 100%.  I also have no desire to see a penis in a woman‚Äôs washroom.

That's not what any one wants and women shouldn't be in the same bathroom as men who are just whipping their dicks out at the urinal. That's just opening the door for so much more sexual harrassment and danger.

I‚Äôll say this, I am a woman who has survived abuse at the hands of a man. It was only a year. I finally came forward. 

He is being charged by the police for 12 counts against me. The woman after me charged him with 5. From what we publicly did online to warn people before he was arrested, hundreds of women are now safe from this serial abuser of women. 

I‚Äôve done an interview with two newspapers about this and in the process of writing articles for many different publications.  I have started an online group for abused women, and women only because that‚Äôs how a lot of us feel safer. 

I am a ‚Äùfeminism movement‚Äù. I believe the abuse of women is a hate crime against women and should be treated that way. I believe strangulation isn‚Äôt assault, it‚Äôs attempted murder. 

Yet I also spoke with males who were abused by women (or other men). There is no room for them in the one group, but their stories still deserve to be heard and they will be a part of the next articles. 

I know what it‚Äôs like to be subjugated and abused by males. But that‚Äôs certain males, not all men. The men who abuse are not men, they are monsters. 

Good luck in your fight. We just have a difference of opinion and that‚Äôs ok. I despise abusive ‚Äúmen‚Äù. Yet some men I love and have fought with me in this movement. To protect everyone. All people who are victimized.

He was very openly gay so it can't be excused by him needing to stay in the closet. He stayed married so someone would take care of him.

It is another issue for me of the art versus the artist. Same thing with Lovecraft. The man was the definition of racist but his stories were actually genius. Or Bill Cosby--without the Cosby Show being such a smash hit you wouldn't have had Fresh Prince, In Living Color, Martin, etc.

6156,"The first thing I think of wrt genius then and now isn't sexism, it's forcing kids to learn at the same pace as other kids their age regardless of how gifted they are. I realize that this interacts strongly with sex, BUT at the same time, I think a lot of female genius today is being lost to the factory assembly-line model of schooling, because by the time you actually get a chance to stretch your mind, it's fossilized. Genius requires being allowed to learn in a state of flow, which was more possible in the past than today. It was easier to learn multiple languages/be a polymath back then because you weren't expected to wait for the rest of the class to catch up, and in the meantime maybe help someone else with stuff you find excruciatingly boring.

From what I've seen, exceptionally gifted people seem to either soar or tank, depending on whether or not the environment is supportive or not. Sex is only one component of that (though it is a significant one). Conformity is another. I don't know if gifted programs help or not. They tend to get watered down. I was only allowed to accelerate a bit, and it didn't really help with either the frustration or the isolation.

The other thing, of course, is that women of genius in the past have often not been seen as geniuses because they were interested in girl stuff, e.g. Maria Montessori.

6160,"It was easy to be a master of history, medicine, physics, engineering, etc when all those fields were in their early stages. Today, genius is measured by deep engagement with a specific field, because r skills, not by todays standards.  Sciences were primitive, simply being literate (unlike most population) wealthy male with enough free time to read four important books on a subject made one an expert. I am not exaggerating. The entire knowledge of medicine in renaissance europe for example fit into few books and it was mostly pseudosicientific nonsense. They knew nothing about cells, microbes, hormones, how brain works etc. 

Any ordinary person today knows more about almost any subject that da Vinci knew in his time. He would've known virtually nothing about world outside Europe, nothing about basic physics like gravity (Newton was two centuries later), nothing about microscopic matter/life etc. He tried to study how the heart pumps blood because it was a mystery back then. This isn't shitting on da Vinci (he was certainly a genius artist) but his inventions have been overrated and the same goes  for all these Renaissance men. People write shit like how he invented a helicopter, because he had imaginary model that resembled it, but this is like saying that George Lucas invented a space station that can blow up planets because he came up with the Death Star. It's just fantasy. 

It was easy to be a master of history, medicine, physics, engineering, etc when all those fields were in their early stages. Today, the amount of information available is infinitely greater and so the measure of genius is now how deep a person's knowledge of a single field is, because nobody can master any field perfectly in their lifetime."

Usually, these dudes love to brag about being science savvy, but can't detect basic confirmation bias. Sciene, journalism, everything that tries to make factual statements needs to be cross-checked by people who hold different world views and have complementary expertise. Otherwise they're very limited. Limited and narrow accounts of history can be useful as well as long as they are *contexualized*. And that's what's missing most of the time."

Haha.  And maybe the ‚Äúgenius‚Äù factor has something to do with my strong preference for the Gothic Art period to the Renaissance. At least many of the known Gothics were not served by women, or other races, but by ""brothers"" in the monasteries, or religious houses. And also were not individualistic, not celebs, but were tied to both the religious and greater local community, and you can experience this in the directness, objective qualities, and human-ness of many of their works."

Plus she didn't actually have full control of her own money - her brother was involved - but at his urging she limited how much she'd give Oscar because she knew Oscar was completely useless with money and he'd end up spending all their sons' inheritance on champagne and cigarette boxes for his friends. Oscar of course veered between understanding completely and raging about how unfair it was.

I do think he loved his wife but he was also horribly cruel to her once the sheen had worn off and he started sleeping with men. His biographers generally seem to agree that he didn't twig to his sexual orientation until after marriage - before that he was actually known as a bit of a prude, didn't like coarse talk, the complete opposite of his older brother who couldn't keep out of brothels - and while she had way more money than him, this was discussed with her father before the marriage and he worked hard to reduce his debts before they wed.

6193,"Labour is a tricky subject, historically speaking. What did the book class as labour? For much of recorded history working men were required to complete military service and the training that went with it which would naturally remove them from working a job or in the home. During the Hellenistic period, for example, the standing armies of various kings and princes would number tens of thousands and they'd be 'on duty' for years at a time, constantly being refreshed and replenished as they died in pointless sieges and prolonged marches. 

 I'm glad that women's history is getting more attention in modern academia. In fact, in my uni almost all of the women I've spoken to are studying topics relating to women and gender roles in the ancient world. If anything I'm starting to feel pigeon-holed by it, since women overwhelmingly choose female-centred spheres of study while men still dominate in other topics (like warfare, economy etc.) I take a class in ancient aesthetics and most of the women on my course are doing it as a supplement to a project on womens' issues, while the (very few) men are discussing it in a more general, less gender-centric sense."

6199,"I was just saying today how strange I found it that after being mercilessly bullied my whole childhood and teens for being so different, all of a sudden, in my very first semester in college I noticed that I was getting constant, effusive compliments about my personal style or my comments in class.  Literally *everything* that used to make me different in such a *bad* way when I was young was suddenly coded the exact *opposite* way as an adult!  All of a sudden, society wants to reward confidence, innovation, a critical mind, outspokenness, and individualism--*after* more than a decade of the school system beating all that out of you.

I also wish there was more support for gifted children and teens because there is a really peculair presupposition in education that smart kids *must* come from a good family.  Teachers and administrators tend to assume parents are nurturing the gifts of their exceptional child, and yeah, the smarter kids on average seemed to have much better home lives and financial support, but then there was *me* getting the highest test scores in the entire *school* but having to raise my sister while living with a drunken neglectful mother and her sex abuser felon boyfriend.  

Teachers tended to think I was lazy or lacked motivation when it came to things like extracurriculars, entering competitions, and planning for college applications with their parents, but my reality wasn't one that even remotely made me think there was a future for me.  I was too intellectual to hang out with many of the kids who had families as bad as my own, but then I was too trashy for the smart kids.  

I can't even *imagine* how much worse this situation would be if someone belonged to a minority group that was viewed negatively IN ADDITION TO what I went through.  Education needs to beware that it isn't conflating ""intelligent"" with some twisted notion of ""respectable.""  It's not enough to merely *identify* gifted students if they have zero support at home, and teachers shouldn't assume that just because parents were capable of producing a smart child, it means those parents necessarily give a crap about that child.

I eventually went to an Ivy League grad school on full scholarship after dropping out of high school and taking a winding path through my bachelor's.  I was so excited to meet people who were WAY smarter than me!  However, I was saddened to find that many of these students weren't particularly bright and usually didn't do there homework either, but they all shared *almost identical* socioeconomic histories! They all had parents who had literally been prepping them to be the very best and brightest since *birth* in spite of their *actual* strengths and weaknesses.  It was definitely a sobering reminder of how different I was once again."

That's not true, most of the renaissance ""geniuses"" were simply highly skilled artisans who were sent as kids to learn a skill in a shop and made a living by selling their artworks. 

Patriarchy is the reason young boys were sent to do artisan labour while women where sold in to marriage or locked in a convent, and classism is what made it possible for the clergy, bankers and landowners to commission expensive artworks, but let's not pretend that artists in the XV century were evil oppressors.

Oh, and they most likely didn't have time to go to an art college/academy/tutor since the age of 14, they most likely were helping their mothers cook and clean by the age of 6, oh and they also weren't *allowed* in painting colleges unless their fathers were already wealthy or established, well known painters.

So many times we would be reading texts and ask 'what were the women doing?' We'd also ask 'What were the slaves doing? The children?'

Irish Christianity was super supportive of double monasteries, and the places influenced by them such as Gaul and England therefore developed them too. In England, for example, double monasteries were a thing in the 7-8th centuries, most famously a place called Whitby abbey which had separate female and male institutions but were together, as well as barking abbey. Here the female institutions have cool archaeological remains suggesting writing (styluses have been found at Whitby abbey) and the role of female scribes has been very overlooked. However both monasteries and convents almost disappeared in the next few centuries as indivual institutions let alone double monasteries (in the late 8th century one of the councils of nicaea banned double monasteries but by then even single monasteries or convents had declined or often disappeared in much of England).  the revival of monasteries in the 10th century in England involved separate monasteries and convents/nunneries, to the point that men weren‚Äôt even allowed to enter convents. I only studied this period but wikipedia suggests there may have been a revival in the 12th century in England, and that double monasteries existed in the early Christian Byzantine empire."
6249,"Nuns serving monks: This varied throughout the history of the church, but as far as I can recall, this was more the exception than the rule.

Plus a lot of the STEM programs tell me all about how they are trying to get women in technology but it's just building marshmallow and toothpick towers. That's more relevant to engineering but even then I don't think these kids feel a huge connection to engineering.  


Some stuff is ""lets make this unfinished page cute with CSS!"" which can be fun for some people but a lot of teens are getting a really dumb idea of programming from that. I hear young people say ""I am a programmer and the two languages I know are html and css!"" ... ""We did a school stem project in those! I basically have the skills of a front end web developer!""  


\*headdesk\*  


Neither of these are actual languages that can do things, they can only change the appearance of something. It can be a nightmare to work with if you don't think very artistically or hate formatting, while you can be actually good at true programming. I wouldn't be surprised, no I'm sure, that girls with actual logic and maths inclinations found CSS very unfun in some STEM day, were given the impression that writing Cascading Style Sheets to change the appearance of html is what actual programming feels like, and then decided that they never want to do programming.  


I've heard from teen girls more than once ""I hate programming and am bad at it...""  
and it turns out they think programming is css + html because thats what their school was hyping up. I also saw 1/3 of the people in my first few computer science classes quit because this isn't what they thought programming was. Some of them were really arrogant about their skills because they can restyle a website. A lot of them were young women.  


Here pulled this off of stack overflow because it expresses what I think about all these ""I'm a really good programmer who know's html and css""

> People who say they program in HTML are generally mistaken about programming. HTML is a [markup language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) and CSS is a [style sheet language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylesheet_language). HTML is designed to store content hierarchically and CSS is designed to customize how the content is displayed. HTML and CSS are meant to express *presentation*, whereas code typically is written to *do* something, that is, to have some sort of function. 

  
People who can do presentation really well and people who can write good functional code are a lot of times not the same people at all.  


I think there is a fear of ""scaring away"" people from STEM by showing them functional code that doesn't immediately connect to some pretty presentation. Like teenage girls will all get bored and quit if you show them command line programs that are text only because they might be too shallow or dumb to understand it.  


Oh shoot I made a rant that could have been it's own post lol"
6264,"Yeah, it's such a general statement that I find it rather suspicious! One of the many issues surrounding the 'silence' of women (read- silencing) throughout ancient history, is that we can only guess how much work they did and how much was done by male slaves and servants."
6265,"Where did I say it was a side project? Didn't I specifically say that I was glad that the history of women was getting more attention? 

I really am happy that my classmates can study what they want, and that they are encouraged to do so. Women in classics are re-writing accepted notions and the idea that it was not 'men's' history but just 'human' history is very important. We're seeing a boom in books and journals discussing historical women and uncovering their histories from little snippets and hints, especially when it comes to classics. A lot of great work has been done and it's thanks to female historians who've given girls a role model in the field (Mary Beard, Lucy Worsley etc.)

I just feel uneasy at this strange peer pressure to write about ancient women just because i'm also a woman. Should I change my focus in order to fall in line with what's expected of me? My sphere of study is truly andro-centric (I mostly deal with battles/strategy) and as such women don't often feature in central roles. I just feel a little alone in it, sometimes, and I suppose that leads to frustration with my classmates when, really, I'm the one who has a problem."

6278,"I loved reading it.

It's a little condescending and ""girly"" in a bad way to assume girls will only be interested in making sites pretty.  Overly focused on the decorative is one of my main gripes about any curriculum geared towards girls. 

Making bluetooth speakers might be a better and more fun starter project.  You can get them online for around $30.  If I were doing it with a kid, I would have them scavenge the speakers from another piece of hardware, because I think a lot of the fun is tearing stuff apart and seeing how it works.  Then you get to make wire connections and solder, and start thinking about hardware vs software.

Education is hard no matter how you slice it.  People like to think it's as easy as describing what you know to someone.  It's not, learning how to present information and provide them with appropriate challenges takes a lot more effort and ingenuity than most people realize.  

A lot of times, the people pushing girls towards stem aren't in stem themselves.  They just have this non-specific feeling that girls should ""do stem"".  Be more specific!  Do you want girls to be handier, be able to build things better, code what exactly?

6291,"Let me just offer one word of caution here.  Bad men attach themselves to kind and helpful women like malignant parasites, and when they totally use us up, suddenly they don't give a damn about us.  You may feel confident that *he* would never leave *you*, but if he starts to sense too much strength or independence in you, he could decide to leave you and leave you in a BAD position.  We think these men love us, or at *very* least that they would act somewhat honorably in a breakup, but you can't count on that. 

I'm disabled and didn't have my ""own"" independent money, which kept me tethered to my abusive ex-husband until I could find SOME way to get out financially, but my health got markedly worse all of a sudden, and my ex wasn't extracting value from me anymore, so he not only left but cleaned out all the bank accounts, ran up massive credit card bills, and bought a new car with whatever was left.  This all happened over the course of ONE DAY, which seemed sudden to *me*, but he had been planning all of it out and consulting for *months* with an attorney on how to get away with it all.

If you wait until the time is right, you'll *always* be able to come up with an excuse or a reason to wait a little longer.  There IS no ""right"" time.  Don't rely on the thought that he needs you, because he could start an online fling or flirt with a new woman at work for five minutes and suddenly decide to screw you over and start a new life.  They aren't nearly as loyal as we think, and it doesn't take much for them to act dishonorably once we're not useful to them.  Don't risk letting *him* decide when ""the right time"" to end things might be."
6292,"I‚Äôm not a lawyer, but from frequently perusing the legal advice and relationship subs, the overwhelming advice appears to be to make sure you do not leave the home in the separation. Supposedly the person to leave the home is significantly less likely to be able to keep the home in the divorce. That‚Äôs only what I‚Äôve read frequently though. 

Seek a lawyer and financial advisor secretly from your husband, the professional advice on what steps you should be making, whilst he is unawares for as long as possible, is crucial to protect yourself, your dog, and any children you may have, as well as your assets.

6303,"Document, document, document. 

If he's as narcissistic as you're making out, he's going to try to demand unsupervised visitation after you go through the hell of birth and early infancy, which is the last thing you want.

He'll have access to the trans-lobby as he gaslights you, but everything you do NOW to document abuse, drinking and drugging, mental illness, what have you---will help you demonstrate he's an unsuitable parent. You DO NOT want him taking care of your 2-year-olds, once he decides they're cute and he wants to use them as a prop on social media. 

Get out in front of this now. If he's drinking and driving, call the police and get his arrested. If he has illegal drugs, do the same. If he assaults or threatens you, prosecute. 

And I hope you can find a face to face support group. God bless. "

6306,"‚ÄúA real woman can‚Äôt just run away‚Äù

Absolutely THIS. This is one of the core aspects of the trans ideology that grinds my gears so fucking much.

The whole thing is so enraging!

We women spend our *whole teenage and adult lives* worrying about our reproductive system and the absolutely ginormous impact it can have on our life, socially, economically, health wise, career-wise, absolutely every aspect. Whether we are doing all we can to try and avoid pregnancy, seeking contraception in a place that tries to make it difficult, seeking an abortion, counting the days in the calendar trying to work out if our period is late or not, actively trying to get pregnant, suffering from fertility problems, menopause, dealing with discrimination in the workplace because our employers think we will become pregnant even if we have no intention of, the ‚Äòmotherhood‚Äô career penalty, living with the physical consequences of pregnancy complications years later, the list goes on and on and on and on. 

The sheer audacity to call yourself a woman whilst doing the one thing only a man can do... running away from the pregnancy you caused... shameful."

6308,I can't think of anything more MALE than abandoning a woman you impregnated.
6309,">Now, a few months later I'm pregnant. With twins. Apparently this makes them so dysphoric that they no longer want to be with me

To me this sounds like nothing more than a translation of ""I don't find you sexy anymore that you're pregnant and I don't want to deal with being a parent either so I'm just going to ditch you"".

I don't buy that he's all of a sudden so horribly dysphoric that he HAS to leave. He's just using it as an excuse to run away from his responsibilities as the father of your twins. Especially since his ""dysphoria"" didn't prevent him from knocking you up in the first place.

He's a useless, immature deadbeat and while I know everything is really hard right now, I believe firmly that in the long run you will be better off without him. He would likely never pull his weight even if he stuck around and you'd end up with 3 dependants instead of 2.

He's in the wrong. You're in the right. He's an asshole.

&#x200B;

>I should have known better.

I firmly believe we're not guilty of anything when we expect others to act in good faith. The shame in this situation is not yours. It's his. ALL his.

&#x200B;

ETA: I'm not going to get into the speculation over whether he's actually a closet, homophobic homosexual or not. I think it's irrelevant to the main point, which is that this man has got a woman into a really shitty position and then refuses to do anything to help, but instead buggers off to do ""his thing"", whatever that thing is. Whatever his motivations are, he's using the dysphoria as an excuse to get out of the situation. "

There‚Äôs a good trans widows thread on mumsnet where they all describe pretty much the same thing. Initially masculine acting man comes out as trans and then rapidly makes everything about transition, abandoning all responsibilities and completely altering their personality. It‚Äôs the new midlife crisis, but instead of running off with a young girl they try to become one. The general consensus is that they‚Äôre better off cutting him out ASAP, otherwise you‚Äôd see the household expenses all go on miniskirts and panties, and have to deal with all the emotional labour he suddenly needs."

If you are in the US, contact Planned Parenthood.  They offer wellness services for pregnant women (not just abortions) and they might be able to point you at other sources of support.

OP, you are the strong one.  You supported this person, helped him, even through your doubts.  This person can't tolerate anything that isn't perfect, and responds by rejecting you.  Don't blame yourself for being strong, for being the adult, for being kind."
6319,"Fuck that piece of shit. He's scum. Get angry with him so you can get through this, repressing your natural anger sucks your will to live. Do scream. Scream into a pillow if you've got close neighbours. Punch things. I think some of your depression comes from the extent to which he gaslighted and brainwashed you. Getting angry with him will help.

Then reach out to someone. Have you got any family or friends you can go to for help?

And this may be a terrible idea but I'd consider telling the truth about his behavior on social media if I were you. it sounds like you haven't got much to lose, it could be cathartic and maybe someone will reach out to help you.

The good thing about emergencies like the one you're in is that the need to survive can help you focus. I'm not in the USA but the link below has  some resources for pregnant women in poverty. One step at a time, one foot in front of the other. If you're still feeling tempted towards suicide,  *imagine how much your piece of shit ex would enjoy the attention if you did it.*  He'd be able to cast himself as a tragic heroine for the rest of his life.   Do not allow him an opportunity to co-opt your death like he co-opted your life.

In my opinion, he‚Äôs jealous of the attention you‚Äôre getting as a pregnant woman, and he‚Äôll be even more jealous of the attention the baby will get."
6331,"I‚Äôm so sorry OP. You deserve a supportive partner but instead were completely bamboozled. I doubt any of us could have seen that coming.

 This is one of the number one reasons I‚Äôm adamantly against allowing males into female sexed spaces and female institutions- the pregnancy risk. It‚Äôs EXTREMELY irresponsible for an institution to create the conditions that allow for a woman to get pregnant when she is most vulnerable- women in crisis shelters should not be faced with pregnancy risk *inside their bunk*, even if they WANT to have sex with this guy, it‚Äôs not right the institution putting them in this position.

 Similarly, what your child‚Äôs *father* is doing is NOT RIGHT. He is being incredibly self-centered, typical male socialization. There are two people whose needs come before his now, but he‚Äôs worried about how he doesn‚Äôt like his penis, just like so many other deadbeat dads. Transpeople who father or mother children but still claim to be the opposite sex are absolutely *the most delusional*.  I also got duped into believing that men who have fathered children can up and *feel like a woman*. UGH. 

I hope you get all the support to do what you need, and if you carry to term, I‚Äôm happy to point you to some resources for suing him for child support (if USA), which is not a punishment or revenge, but what your children deserve and have a right to. I‚Äôm sure all the court paperwork that says ‚Äúpaternity establishment‚Äù and ‚Äúfather‚Äù will make him really dysphoric but that‚Äôs real life "
6332,Get a good supportive therapist who let's you vent without saying you are a TERF. Please talk to at least one attorney about your situation and how to protect yourself and your kids. 
6333,"It's very kind of you to apologize, but I don't think you did anything wrong. You, like many of us, were a victim of the wolf in sheep's clothing that this movement has become. You wanted to be accepting. Be loving and supportive.  It's hard to know that you're the victim of psychological abuse until things really escalate. 

&#x200B;

So now let's focus on you. What this MAN did to you was selfish and awful and irresponsible, in a way only a man can be. Don't spare his feelings when you tell people about it. It's your truth. Take care. "
6334,"The best piece of advice I received when I was leaving my abusive ex was to sign up for food stamps and Medicaid.  You may be eligible to receive TANF because you're pregnant, but I am not certain.  Do it as soon as you can, and then file for divorce. Trust me, it is HARD to do, but it will be so so so worth it in the long run. "
6335,"Hey so I can relate to that, while my boyfriend of that time wasn't a TIM, he left me because he didn't want a baby. I've been left alone with the pregnancy and was shamed for it; as if it would've been alone my fault. I went to court to sue him for children support but he only paid the bare minimum. I put my daughter in a nursery when she was half a year old and continued to work. It was rough but the hard times did pass, I remember having mental breakdowns almost every day because I was so stressed - don't be afraid to ask friends for help! I didn't have many friends at that time but I found through an announce in the newspaper a student who majored in child care, she supported me as a babysitter so I could work in the evenings sometimes (babysitters are easier to get if you look out for girls like that). If you search for a kindergarten place, look out for those who are opened long. Some are only until 1 pm; some until 7 pm. I was actually able to demand half of the money for the kindergarten from the ""father"". I don't know if thats possible in your country though. With my financial struggles I got in contact with the church and their organisations, they sell cheap clothes in goodwill etc and while I am absolutely not happy with religion, a friendly community member was able to explain me how to get the best support and everything. Hope that helped a little bit! I am sure you will make it. Reach out for other women! "
6336,"I'm glad you're here, but I'm sorry about what's brought you here. "
6337,I know this is hard but you need to think about custody right now. Fight for your child before he comes back wanting to use them to prop up his narcissism. 
6338,"Honestly, if you see this as ""ruining my life"" and an ""utter shit storm"" I think you should consider abortion, or adoption if you're too late to abort. Raising a kid by yourself is tough as shit already, but adding one more infant and negotiating with such a self-serving father? Sounds bad.  


Please don't blame yourself. You thought you were doing the right thing and you didn't know he would abandon you."

The pressure on our babies ""experimenting"" with gender to take drugs and get surgeries is going to be brutal, good people will be necessary, good luck, hope you have a supportive family glad to be rid of bad rubbish."

6341,"Based on what another poster said, If you're in the states you may qualify for TANIF, depending on what state you're in. "
6342,"I think this is a common reaction of AGPs when their partners become pregnant. I‚Äôve seen it happen in my community. Their arrested development can‚Äôt handle situations that require maturity like being a parent and they vanish.

So sorry your husband did this to you."
6343,"I'm sorry you're going through this, he appears to be a repressed homosexual with internalized homophobia, that could be why he felt the need to pretend to be a woman to be with other men and why it started with other men pretending to be women and has now graduated to ""vaginas and women are gross"".

Many of us are indeed ""radical"", the difference is that the ""radical"" in radical feminism is intended to mean *root* and not extremist. 

We have almost the whole word against us as women, from birth we're brainwashed and treated as less,might take a while to leave behind that programming. 

Live and learn sister, live and learn."
6344,"**(((I echo all the sympathy and empathy here. All the love you think you lost, and more than you can ever imagine, is about to fill your life. You‚Äôre heart is about to grow so big no one can ever break it again.)))**

Planned Parenthood in my area (in the south) only provides abortions. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a funding cut or we have too many pregnant women or what... so beware you may find that. And don‚Äôt let it get you down. Medicaid is an option and you can even look for a obgyn with a midwife on the roster. I had one when I was on Medicaid and pregnant. 

TANF, WIC and Section 8. You should qualify for all of them. Get whatever you can. I got a lot of free diapers and baby things from Catholic Charities, call around and see who‚Äôs got programs for single mothers. You have to act fast bc as soon as you actually have the baby, some of the opportunities will dry up. If you want to DM me your town and state I will search for resources for you myself while you rest.üñ§

My mom did something with one of her children and while I initially thought it was crazy, it worked for her. If you‚Äôre not going to go through the family court system, maybe you wanna consider asking him to sign over his rights. Pretend you are doing it so he doesn‚Äôt have to think about this ever again, as a ‚Äúfavor‚Äù to him. Draft a legal document and have him sign it. I heard that he still can even be made to pay child support even with signing over his rights. Even if you *do* end up going to court, get him to sign something saying he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with the burden of fatherhood, then use it as proof of his attitude at this time. You can show a progression of abandonment and then potentially how he has completely changed his mind and become antagonistic or tries to dominate you and his children. It‚Äôs an option of more documentation. 

Cortisol is not good for you rn. Try to fill yourself with love as much as you can. Focus on things you love right now. He doesn‚Äôt even deserve your anger. Anger is just going to hurt your body, raise your bp, make your impulse control worse. Practice deep breathing and surround yourself with whatever you can to make you happy. Oh. And walk tons for your labor so it can go easy. When you‚Äôre mad or sad or bored, walk. Physical activity is as effective as an antidepressant and it‚Äôs got no side effects on a fetus.

You got this Queenüêù Bee!

6345,he never cared about being a woman. It's all a fetish for him. 
6346,"It took me time to understand that ""they"" is actually a ""he"". I can assure you he perfectly knows this and he is to me, very manipulative based on your story. 
Transwomen are not women after all, they are men with new excuses to make, and it shows here. "
6347,You can call him HE here. 
6348,HE is a piece of shit human. I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through this. 
6349,"I am so, so sorry you are going through this. You deserve SO much better. 

I don't have much insight aside from what the women here have already said. One thing I do want to mention is you should start planning for the future now. I know you're overwhelmed, but there are simple things you can do right now to make things easier on yourself in the future. 

You should find out about your state's laws in terms of recording stuff and see whether you're in a one or two party consent state. If you must communicate with each other, it should be in writing. If he calls you, let it go to voicemail(AFAIK voicemail is admissible in court even in two-party states because the person leaving the message knows they are being recorded). 

Get a composition notebook or a notebook with binding(any notebook where the pages can't easily be torn out) and start documenting his abusive behaviors now. Date, time, place, everything. This will not only help you build a case, but it will also protect you in the event he comes back and tries to suck you back in. Narcissists try to ""hoover"" their victims back once they have been discarded by showering them with love and affection. Victims of narcissistic abuse are conditioned to respond to this ""love bombing"" technique, but if you have a written record of the horrible things he's done, you can refer back to it whenever you feel tempted to go back to him. 

In any case, you want to start laying the groundwork for your side ASAP in the event he comes back in the future and tries to get custody/visitation with your kids. 

I know it is overwhelming, but this might help you reassert some measure of control over your life. First and foremost, please take care of yourself and know that this community and many others are here for you anytime you need support or just a shoulder to cry on. 

Best wishes <3"
6350,"That's because it's a mental illness that should be treated and supported, not celebrated and encouraged."
6351,"I'm also pregnant, and married to a trans. It's been the hardest thing I've ever gone through. My husband is now gay too, and tells me how gross my vagina is all the time. He is always chatting with other trans, furries online.  My daughter now thinks she is trans too.... I wish I could give you advice, but really the only thing you can do is try to take care of yourself.  I'm so sorry you are going through this. "
6352,"PERSONALLY, if I were in your position I'd abort. A custody battle with a deranged cross dresser who has the public narrative on their side is going to be something I wouldn't wish on anyone. Dare this person get any kind of visitation and who knows if the children will end up abused.

If that's not an option, skip town, change your name, move to a different country or at the VERY LEAST, do not put him on the birth certificate or pursue child support. Have him terminate his rights as soon as possible if you don't want to leave.

Either way, be on the defensive from now foreward"
6353,"How is this fair? If he feels dysphoric, does he even consider how you feel, alone and pregnant with twins? Some people are too selfish to fathom. "
6354,"Sending you support and solidarity, sister."
6355,"If he stayed and was a responsible parent he'd have to put aside his dreams of trans-on-trans ""lesbian"" sex. Easier for him to just make up a bullshit reason to bail on the family and get away with it because he's more oppressed than you in a lot of people's eyes.

This seems to have happened a lot, though some men act as a father for a while or even years before ditching them to live their porn-fueled fantasies because their online friends have been egging them on."
6356,I'm so sorry you're going through this. The fact is that your pregnancy doesn't HAVE to make your partner feel dysphoric. There are lesbian couples where one of them gets pregnant with donor sperm. Honestly I'd leave the guy and sue for child support. You deserve better. 
6357,Gosh. I have no words. I hope you are getting a lot of support from other people in your life as you go through this. What an absolute scum bag. 
6358,"Sorry this happened to you. You're not the only one. Even this basic story is familiar because they want to be the center of attention (you doing his hair, telling him he's brave, getting his medication, taking care of him) and then you get pregnant and suddenly you genuinely need some attention. He can't tolerate that so he leaves to find someone who will pamper him.

He is a dead beat. Is there any way to get his parental rights terminated? I feel really bad for the kids who will have to deal with him traipsing in and out of his life and using them for his own validation (heads up, if he gets visitation he will probably demand your kids call him 'mommy' too) and it might be easier to get him to sign paperwork now while it's all hypothetical and save you some trouble later on. I don't know. I would speak to a family lawyer.  


ETA: I usually don't make strong statements about other people's relationships because we never know the full story but UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU CONSIDER TAKING HIM BACK. Even if he was to drop the woman act today everything he's done so far has been narcissistic abuse. He waited until you were at your most vulnerable before dropping this. It was NOT an accident that he 'suddenly' feels too dysphoric to support you (but not too dysphoric to fuck you without a condom), now that he suddenly has a permanent avenue through which he can control you. He will drag you back and forth through the courts and try to control you using your children. This was always the plan."
6359,"Welcome home, sis. You are loved and welcome here."
6360,"Just wanted to add that he IS being a deadbeat dad. Don't let the newspeak mangle reality for you. Transitioning is not an excuse for abandoning your responsibilities. I hope things will turn out ok for you. Seek out other professional and social supports - you deserve both. Also reach out in this sub along your journey, we understand, and we're here for you."
6361,It happens. [Here's a Tedtalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3mnUMmUAHQ) about a woman who went through something similar. I don't know if they had children though.
6362,"I read your story two days ago and it has haunted me ever since. 

Instead of screaming, ""Deadbeat Dad"" scream something that will hit him in the feels.

""A woman would never do this to her children.""

This is the part that has been haunting me. Transwomen are always screaming about how much they ""feel"" like a woman, but they don't act like women. They have no idea what feeling like a woman is because they will never be one. It's not all about dresses, heels, periods, and monthly cramps. We are living, breathing, emotional, and complex human beings. 

Women don't run out on their children. Women don't threaten rape with spiked broom handles. And women don't crumble in the face of adversity. You never know the strength of a woman until she is put to the test such as you have been.

He will never be as strong as you. Good luck to you and your babies."
6363,"Glad to see your edit, OP. Please stay with us. You are not alone!"
6364,"There was a woman posting somewhere asking for advice because her hysterectomy made her trans friend ""dysphoric."" These people are mentally I'll narcissists."
6365,"File for child support against the asshat when you pop. They can ree all they want but they done did it and now they have to pay. Also, back up every single message and communication in triplicate. "
6366,Deadbeat dad for sure. I wish you and your twins the best. I hope you get child support from him. It probably doesn't seem like it but it's better he fucked off now rather then disappoint your twins later when inevitably fucks off later on in their lives. 
6367,"Completely your choice, but I would not have these babies if I were you. I would not want to be reminded of the shitty person that fathered them."
6368,"I want to start off by saying, I am a transgendered woman. That being said, I am deeply ashamed at how your partner has treated you throughout this very difficult and confusing time in your life. You are absolutely right in saying trans women cant fully understand what you're going through and have no right to talk to you about abortions. It pains me to see that its people like your partner that give the trans community a horrible name. Dysphoria or not, they made a choice that effected both of your lives. I hate the ""im being attacked"" ideology of the trans community when in reality they can do more harm to those around them than they can comprehend. All I want to say is that not all of us are as narcissistic as your partner, and after all you've done to support them, the least they can do is show the same courtesy. I apologize for all you are going through and wish you nothing but the best in this life. I do someday hope your partner realizes the mistake they've made by acting the way they have. You are a strong woman for going through this the way you have and I can only aspire to be at least half the woman you are. I pray all goes well in your future. "
6369,This just makes me so furious. It‚Äôs so sick and wrong. I‚Äôm so tired of the depravity and all the women of this world left holding the bag over and over while men like this think it‚Äôs ‚Äúwoke‚Äù to pursue a life of pure selfishness. Their lives are a complete waste. They will be reincarnated as an STD. 
6370,"Regardless of their gender or sexuality, they played a part in you getting pregnant, they need to step up and be a parent. Period."
6371,"Because you bought into the lefty clique which demands obedience in the same way the righty clique forced ""muh WMDs"" in the 00's.

I'm now pro nihilism and am ""fuck the left"" and its ridiculous litmus tests to avoid being cancelled. 

Forget about being nice. Forget about acceptance. Be authentic and never fucking apologize to anyone on the left again. First, they don't accept it and will cancel you anyway and second, they no longer deserve it.

Embrace nihilism and stock up on marshmallows for when the world starts to burn."
6372,I am so sorry you're dealing with this. Will you ask for child care from him?
6373,"WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.

6374,You are a good person.
6375,"Grown adult male from Virginia here, idk if RedPill folk are welcome here, pls dont lynch me yall, I'm just visiting. 

I just felt compelled to say I have a lot of respect for your bravery. I hope you find a strong man who will come to you and stand in to do what your ex should have been there to do themselves. You are so strong and courageous for accepting your bf when they came out as trans, and you do deserve a better hand. 

Dont have much respect for trans women cause they seem to me like fanatical fantasy escapists. I've never met a trans woman who didnt have other problems either with drugs or with forcing everyone around them to engage in their fantasy play. It really is just a fantasy, the same as acting out a porno or something. 

I really wish you the best, and everyone here has my respect and support from the other side of the aisle! Keep fighting the good fight."

I made the mistake of attempting to get my ex involved in the lives of our children, which ended up with him getting visitation and medical/educational rights because he was somewhat ‚Äúaround‚Äù at my behest because I thought our children deserved a father. 

Let him isolate himself to his heart‚Äôs content. It‚Äôs much harder, legally speaking, to walk back into a child‚Äôs life if a parent has been absent for years. You don‚Äôt want this man around your kids- they don‚Äôt need a father like this."

6393,I will be showing your comment to my husband because you've eloquently expressed my anger on a topic we've been discussing a lot recently. Thank you. 
6394,"*golf clap* This was everything, thank you for putting my argument into words. 

What always bothered me about the ‚ÄúI *feel* like a woman‚Äù ideology is that being a woman means facing a barrage of discrimination and difficulties every goddamn day. What does it mean to feel like a woman? It‚Äôs more than just makeup and dresses. And as feminists, we have fought so hard to be considered equal to men, because we don‚Äôt necessarily feel any different. We just... are women. 

You can‚Äôt say you want to be part of our world and not understand the advantages you have for being born with a penis. I‚Äôll bet this sack of garbage goes to some chat room or group therapy and whines about how it‚Äôs so unfair to him because *he* can‚Äôt get pregnant himself, and how hurt he feels about it. I love how women have been typecast as being ‚Äútoo emotional to be in politics/science/etc‚Äù but all I‚Äôm seeing lately is a bunch of men being whiny-ass babies. 

I only know a little bit about custody laws, but I really hope for OP‚Äôs sake that this guy doesn‚Äôt try and come back later and claim custody over the babies he abandoned. I would think that based on his ‚Äúdysphoria‚Äù, hormone treatments, and general behavior at the moment, the OP could claim he is mentally unfit if it ever came to that. 

Maybe that ideal of mine isn‚Äôt exactly kosher. But for me, feeling like a woman is overcoming barriers in my career field. I‚Äôm getting my PhD in physics, which is overwhelmingly dominated by men. For me, being a woman feels like being depressed for the past 1.5 months because I didn‚Äôt pass my candidacy exams that I studied so hard for, and apparently none of the other women in my program did either. 

It feels like being reprimanded at work for taking a day off because of my period, and then told to ‚Äúget that shit together‚Äù in the future. It feels like having endometriosis that I can‚Äôt have surgery for so I just have to manage the pain. It means massive hormone swings, days that I can‚Äôt get out of bed, but sucking it up anyways with a smile because taking time off for a women problem makes me look bad. It means that I may not be able to have children, but everyone is already judging me for being in my mid-20‚Äôs and getting my PhD and having no immediate perspectives of having a kid anyways. 

Didn‚Äôt mean to just go and talk about myself there and divert from OP‚Äôs problem, I‚Äôm just speaking about my own experience, which is all I can do. On the plus side for me, there aren‚Äôt exactly any TIMs in the scientific field, so work-wise I won‚Äôt have to deal with this kind of fuckery. 

"
6395,"I echo that, hard. Its very interesting talking to trans women who just tell me to casually abort or adopt, and downplay how hard pregnancy can actually be. If they understood what it was like they would understand it's not an easy decision, there are mood swings, there is depression and periods of elation, there is an attachment and losing a child is fucking devastating. I've miscarried before and the pain was like nothing I have ever felt before. I have had nightmares and dreams about the child I never had from three years ago. The emotional toll is not something that is easily translatable yet mothers get held up to such a high standard and we're supposed to just flawlessly eat the pain. I'm not flawless and I'm fucking terrified. "
6396,Exactly this. 
6397,They abandoned me for purely sexual reasons and admitted everything else was fine. Just to step it up a notch.

6400,I bet he doesn‚Äôt even know what an abortion entails. That‚Äôs despicable and a slap in your face. 
6401,I'm sorry to hear that. I haven't had an abortion but I've miscarried in the past and the emotional turmoil is absolute torture. 
6402,"Initially I didn't have a problem with them being a ""mother"" and even them wanting to try and breastfeed, but now, after everything my opinion has flipped hard. I wouldn't budge if they came back and I wouldn't accept them if they came back. You can not call yourself a mother without at least participating in the unsavory parts of motherhood that they will never understand anyways. 

&#x200B;

Our household expenses previously got devoted to their transition so I can imagine. The short time they were around while I was pregnant I would occasionally complain about things like fatigue and morning sickness but never once did I get any comfort. I simply got a sad response of ""I feel sick too."" There was no empathy, no care, they never once helped me prepare a meal or held my hair when I vomited or even took over cleaning, etc. They even smoked around me until I forced them to smoke outside, which they constantly backpedaled on. Nevermind that smoking hurts the effects of their hormones that we spent a ton of money on... I would often dig deeper and try to illicit some kind of caring response which in turn made them focus in on themselves even harder then eventually I would end up comforting them instead. I never got to have a single moment of comfort because it was all overshadowed by the transition, how much they dislike their job or their illnesses that only seemed to occur when I was feeling ill myself."

6404,"I was made to feel like an asshole because I scoffed at the idea of two ""lesbian"" trans women who would refuse to date a women because of a vagina, ridiculous. But it is just that, absolutely fucking ridiculous. It's insulting. It's unfair. But I'm a bigot for thinking that somehow..."
6405,"They had many opportunities to tell me. I caught on to them potentially being trans long before they ever told me and asked them about their behavior myself...I thought I was helping, but I swear they are more neurotic now than ever before and they've turned into a constant validation seeker. "
6406,"Had a bit of a chuckle at, ""....the more illogical...."" part of your comment since that implies there is ANY logic to 'trans' ideology :D"

Worried about being laughed at or bullied because you look silly pretending to be the opposite sex?  Leave the clothing at home.  Practice the kink and fetish at home.  Don't force the rest of us to coddle your ridiculous fantasies and delusions."
6408,"> If you are in the US, contact Planned Parenthood.  They offer wellness services for pregnant women (not just abortions) and they might be able to point you at other sources of support.

No.  They are deep in the trans cult.  I would suggest the exact opposite, avoid them at all cost.  How anyone thinks they aren't solely in it for profits is beyond me.  I have never understood why a woman would go there instead of a proper doctor's office.  I'm on Medicaid and would never in a million years think of going there.

"
6409,"I've applied to everything I believe I can, SNAP and WIC included. I already had pregnancy medicaid so I at least don't have medical bills to cover (if I didn't one ultrasound visit would be 188$ can you believe it?). These things just take time and I'm trying to be hopeful and positive...It's just so fucking hard. And yes, I'm in North Carolina. "
6410,"Yeppers. Exactly what I said. 

I don't want to freak her out now, but it only gets worse after the children are born unless she's got full custody. That's more important than financial help, because he can end up causing so many problems if  he's in your kids' lives (assuming he's as narcissistic as a father as he is as a partner) that you end up losing more in terms of emotional energy, capacity to work/earn money, problems your kids end up having, new court costs, etc. Far better to have full custody and seek resources elsewhere. Better still to move somewhere where he can't find you. "
6411,"I agree 1000%. Get the paperwork while he's still decided he doesn't want to be involved. As a fellow NC resident, I am so sorry for what you're going through. You did nothing wrong."
6412,"This is one of my biggest fears right now. I would lose my mind if they just popped back into the picture to pick up where they left off, as if nothing happened. Then I'd be called an asshole and a bigot for not just going along with it...They of course would be the victim while I'm expected to just be the better and bigger person in all of this no matter how much it pains me."
6413,"I just read it too and I'm terribly worried about her.

OP, do you have any family, friends or former co-workers close by? I wish you had someone to spend time with right now. Please let us know you are ok. "

6417,Par for the fucking course. They go hand in hand. They hate us cuz they ain't us.

6419,That confuses me more than anything. I can not wrap my brain around that sentiment no matter how hard I try.
6420,"There is a group of trans people literally mocking me for ""hating"" all trans people because of a sole trans person...It's nice to know it's not just one sole person and this has happened to so many people. It's nice to know I'm being mocked for deciding to protect myself after the fact from the same people that have caused me pain. "
6421,"I already started to notice the jealousy before they left. Every ache and pain and nauseous feeling I had that I ever voiced out loud was met with a cold callous, ""Yes, I'm sick today too."" response. I would understand if it was a few days but there is no way in hell you are sick every day for absolutely no reason at every moment I am. "
6422,"I'm starting to see things this way more and more. It's annoying that women have to make themselves uncomfortable to support the fragile egos of others, no matter the cost to women. I had just eaten the cost myself and been supportive, despite the fact that is was a constant drain on my own emotional health. I feel like I have caregiver fatigue. "
6423,">This is one of the number one reasons I‚Äôm adamantly against allowing males into female sexed spaces and female institutions- the pregnancy risk.

Same same."
6424,"WIC too. According to her other post, she's lost her job and isn't eating much. She should qualify for everything, especially being pregnant. A friend of mine who was also pregnant and had the dumb man run off was able to get rental assistance pretty quickly as well, though that might depend on the state. "
6425,"EDIT: I know goodwill is shit but I don't live in the US, I'm sure there are more organisations like that 

Something that made me happy while being pregnant was searching baby stuff in flea markets and choosing the name. It feels so good when you can give them a name while they're still inside the womb, thinking about how you will call them that in the future "
6426,"I'm sorry you had to go through that. I hope you and your daughter are doing better now, and that everything has smoothed over since then? I've talked to my mother and I'm lucky to have her on my side because she should be able to help me. It's also nice to know I don't have to be religious to get help from churches but I'd feel like a sham...Do they press about your personal beliefs when you contact organizations that are run by churches, etc? I still need car seats, diapers, more cloths and cribs, but I have pretty much everything else.

Wow. That's brilliant!"
6431,"Honestly this is what I would do, and actually *did,* to get away from my abuser. I was pretty close to being unable in my state, but I got an appointment at the last minute. It saved my life. Seriously.

  


I had to weigh the cost of the abortion, mental/physical/financial, vs the cost of having to engage with an abusive narcissist who is addicted to BDSM and child porn for the rest of my life. I literally couldn't bear the thought of ever leaving the child alone with him, it would destroy me every time I imagined sharing custody, for obvious reasons. He would abuse them as badly as he did me and everything around him, PLUS the fear of my child getting raped or molested by their father.

  


So it *can* be a very difficult decision. Sometimes plans completely change, men completely change during a pregnancy-- and not for the better-- and it makes the previous choices not the best one anymore. It can be hard when you want a pregnancy, but the person it's with poses a direct danger to the child, or any other dangerous or poor circumstances.

  


This situation, and my own, is the reason I oppose term limits on abortion. We can't possibly draw such a hard line in the sand, life doesn't work that way. Things change, sometimes things go very very wrong. Women should never be trapped because they made the choice earlier on to keep it when circumstances were different.

  


But whatever OP chooses, I wish them the best."
6432,If she already knows it's twins it might be past the 1st trimester. Getting a 2nd trimester abortion is harder. Adoption might be a choice. I'm sure there are lots of parents who would love twins. It's a very tough decision that will affect your entire life.
6433,"It's very difficult in myriad ways for some women to abort.

She may very well want to have them too!

OP hang in there. "
6434,"HE.

A man got this woman pregnant. It's a man who needs to step up."
6435,"You‚Äôre not wrong that all kinds of people can be shitty, but you need to edit the bullshit word ‚Äúcis‚Äù out of your post. ‚ÄúCisgender‚Äù isn‚Äôt a thing. Please read the sidebar and the rules before commenting. "
6436,Thanks for the textbook NotAllMen. Have a look at the transwidow thread linked and you'll see that this is indeed a generalised pattern of behavior in trans identified males.
6437,"Document that he's not there. Document that you go through all the prenatal appointments, the birth, and so on without him. Document what he said when he left you. Document the lack of him, in other words, in spite of his full knowledge that he has fathered children. That way, if he suddenly shows up because small children are a great prop for his game of being a woman, you will have evidence that he willfully abandoned them until he 'felt like' coming back."
6438,"You should still be prepared. Take screenshots of conversations, pictures on social media, record calls, messages, etc. You probably WILL need it in the future, and any kind of evidence would help you immensely."
6439,"If you're in the Triangle you'll be facing the pro-trans lobby--I don't know if they'll be more defanged in 1-2 years, but if not, they're as irritating and self-righteous as West Coast types.  


I'm not happy about the GOP being in charge, but if you have a local state senator or rep who's right-wing (more likely if you're near Wilmington and were affected by the hurricanes) you'll probably have a better chance of having them intervene for you if necessary. And/or if you get involved in a moderately conservative church (no need to go to crazy awful right-wingers, but just old-fashioned traditional people), they'll bend over backwards to support you if you're pregnant and left by a transgender man. They'll be happy you're keeping the pregnancy."
6440,"Very true. I went through a custody evaluation with my ex a while back because I wanted to move further away for a job, and my primary custody status disintegrated, legally speaking, because my son went to preschool. As in, I had him 12 days out of every 14, but the ten days he was in preschool didn‚Äôt count as being in ‚Äúmy custody,‚Äù so we were evaluated as if custody were 50/50 based on the weekends only. So all the mornings I dragged us out of bed, all the evenings I bathed and fed him, the tuition I paid for his preschool... it meant nothing. I would have been in a better position if I had never let my then four-year-old have any early education at all. 

OP really needs to do her research about her state... it still shocks me that I was penalized so heavily for sending my son to a good preschool for less than five hours each day. "
6441,"Sad, but too true."
6442,"I think that is the best option because I've already been told they would fight me on an adoption 100% and apparently they can, and can fight the adoption with a paternity test after the fact. I wouldn't want to risk it and potentially damage any contact I could or would have with my children. I don't want to completely take away their second parent but I have no idea how to navigate the courts and I fear being forced into a custody battle. It does not feel right for them to have anything more than visitation since they are skipping out on me, and most likely months and/or years of our children's lives. "
6443,If he can abandon then once then he can and will again.

6451,It's okay to say he. That's all a deadbeat dad should be referred to as.
6452,He. Only men can impregnate. He's a HE.
6453,Fuck off.
6454,"Thank you. First, he tried to make the situation about what *I'd* done to *him*. Then, he tried to act like he couldn't come up with half the money while he had a teaching job and I was unemployed. I had to throw a fit to get him to ask his wealthy parents for it. He is a child that wants to play in women's clothes, not face tough reproductive decisions and live with the memory of what a vacuum sounds like inside your body. I'm so grateful to have this place for support."
6455,"True, they ignore so much reality."
6456,I guess better phrasing would be how intensely divorced from reality.
6457,"A lot of reasons. Sometimes they are the only office accepting new patients in your area. Other times, the ability to drop in and have some amount of anonymity make PP patients feel secure. Many doctor's won't see you unless you have insurance. PP also seems to reduce the risk of ""slut shaming"" one might experience at a typical obgyn if you're going for an abortion, birth control, or any service at all if you're a single mother. 

I have been to PP many times. I was just there with my little sister last week. Though a lot of their literature is transactivist in nature, most staff certainly aren't. If OP needs to go there, she doesn't have to discuss why her husband left, or even that he left at all. "
6458,"Sure they may be deep in the trans cult, but for a lot of women, planned parenthood is still a godsend.

I live in a state in the US where one church basically runs the state: from health care to public policy. What they want, they get. And unfortunately, this church views birth control as a sin. Because of this, most health insurances in this state do not cover reproductive health for women. My insurance is no different. To get birth control at a regular doctor‚Äôs office would cost me  a pretty penny that I don‚Äôt have because I would have to pay entirely out of pocket. I would have to pay about $400 to just SEE my doctor and then almost $1,000 for the birth control I wanted (an IUD). But I was able to get VERY affordable birth control at the planned parenthood here in my city.  "
6459,"Lmao, oh right - so not like the proper medical industry, who are solely in it out of the goodness of their hearts!! *gag*"
6460,"I'd rather women get the medical care they deserve, no matter who it supports "
6461,"Because many women don't qualify for Medicaid (especially in red state where expansion was denied) and can't afford private services, there are ""proper"" doctors at PP who offer services at costs that won't bankrupt you *shrugs*"
6462,"Yeah I've heard that about PP too. Were they the ones who insisted on midwives referring to pregnant women as ""pregnant people""? Or am I remembering wrong?"
6463,"Isn't that like saying ""don't breath the air it has car fumes in it which is bad for you"".  

It might have bad stuff but you need it to live."
6464,"I‚Äôm not an American, so I don‚Äôt know how your system works or who you can contact. I suggest you maybe edit your post to mention your region so that Americans here can chime in with legal advice on who to contact. 

What I am certain about is that you want to keep a financial and other (maybe audio record, conversations, voicemail, email, screenshots of messenger conversations) of your ex-partner abdicating in his responsibility as a parent and causing you undue stress (doctor‚Äôs note). You want to have proof in a custody battle that he is an unfit parent, and a child isn‚Äôt a photo prop for Instagram when it seems convenient for him to want to reclaim rights for selfish attention seeking reasons.

Perhaps record a call where you get him to admit your pregnancy is too inconvenient to him, and that he doesn‚Äôt plan to come back to support you because he mentally can‚Äôt even handle the idea of you being pregnant. Get all this on record. Save this and upload copies to google drive, drop box, and burn to CD. Insure your children‚Äôs mental health away from this selfish person who doesn‚Äôt put anyone else‚Äôs needs before his own, especially that of a woman at a high risk pregnancy (twins). 

Hang in there."
6465,"Great advice. It may seem like a ton of work right now, but after those babies are born it's going to be ten times harder."
6466,"Good advice on moving. Where the babies are born, the babies will stay, unless there‚Äôs an extremely unlikely win in court (really, The Hague Convention: I could write about it all day since I‚Äôve been following cases for years, but essentially, birth those babies away from this man, and preferably somewhere you can settle for at least six months after.)

If the OP has relatives or friends in another state, she should go. NOT after the babies are born, then she could easily lose them for kidnapping her own children. But before the birth, somewhere he won‚Äôt follow, or can‚Äôt follow within six months of their birth? Go! 

Also: exclusive breastfeeding. Either do it or say you‚Äôre doing it, and can‚Äôt pump. Courts are loath to take breastfeeding babes from moms for even an overnight. 

I hate pulling out the nuclear options, but in this case they sound not just necessary but like plain old common sense."
6467,"...

I'm sure you know that a lot of organizations that focus on WOMEN'S HEALTH have to pander to trans bullshit so they can keep their funding, right? 

Have you ever been to a Planned Parenthood????

PP is a valuable, affordable, and hopefully to a lot of women, accessible resource. When I was there asking for birth control, they were very informative, and talked to me in private to MAKE SURE I WASN'T BEING ABUSED OR CONTROLLED. That's so important. 

They're already having to fight against conservatives wanting to defund them. Then they have to put up with the threat of defunding if they don't comply with the demand of trans stuff, like what happened with the Vancouver Crisis Center. 

&#x200B;"
6468,"I am visiting my local Planned Parenthood today for the first of two abortion appointments. The only other abortion clinic in my state is two hours away and is also run by Planned Parenthood.  

PP is not perfect but it may be one of the only organizations that is actively saving women's lives every day."
6469,I'm gonna guess your opposition to Planned Parenthood has a lot more to do with you being anti-abortion than anything else.
6470,"Whatever messed up things PP does about trans, that shouldn't mean that women have to lose out. A pregnant mother of twins has the right to do what she's gotta do, and go wherever she needs to go, at the end of the day."
6471,"all i understand is this trans person wants to pick and choose what they want about being female/feminine and then tell everyone else that that's all being female need be about

i guess im african american cause i like to put on backwards caps and anyone who says your genes or skin color are necessary is just trying to silence my identity"
6472,"At times I find that annoying, other times somewhat enraging due to my life experiences with men. How long have you put your feelings aside, shoved that down, for the benefit of a man who is depending on YOU to love himself? No one can heal the holes in our hearts but ourselves, you will not find it in a marriage or friendship. Although these both can be wonderful as long as you got your own back too. You and the babies are the most important now <3. 

I am actually on a caregiver fatigue initiative- if you need local resources for burnout social services workers probably will know about those since they utilize them themselves. Social services will also have food, fianncial, and medical assistance if that applies to you. There‚Äôs some good apps out there like the guided meditation apps. When a parent is feeling burned out I suggest to them to find respite, take a minute for yourself and check in to what you need. "
6473,">It's also nice to know I don't have to be religious to get help from churches but I'd feel like a sham...

Nope, don't let this thought burden you one bit! Most churches see this as helping ministry in a ""What Would Jesus Do"" way and don't expect those in need to share their beliefs. They may put you on their prayer list, but hey, positive vibes from the universe, eh?"
6474,"I've been told by my ex that they felt more comfortable with someone like them because they would also have something ""wrong"" with them. I don't think sour grapes is far off but I can not pretend to understand all of the backwards logic. "

6476,"Repressed homosexuals have been known to do this, it's not exactly rare to find gay men and lesbians with bio children from previous hetero relationships (many times a marriage even)"
6477,It could be a personality disorder from childhood sexual abuse or something along those lines. I just don‚Äôt understand why men wait until they‚Äôre married and fathers to ‚Äúrealise they‚Äôre a woman‚Äù. 
6478,"You have my complete sympathy because I know that is a tough decision. I work in the healthcare field and have heard some wild things especially when children are involved. Fighting or arguing with abusers is a losing game so its better to leave or never have that fight at all. 

As for OP, he's shown you who he is, believe it and never put anything past him. If you think he's not capable or won't do something, plan for him to do it. This a selfish insane bastard you're dealing with and children are involved"
6479,"Heck yea they would (want twins) .... I want twins T__T. The problem though is that she would have to still duck and dodge for a while so they could be adopted out and he can't contest to it. She's still got time and options, but he has to be cut off and out ASAP"
6480,[removed]
6481,"Yes, this! You might feel silly or a little paranoid asking people to help you document these things, but you NEED to do it. Ask your OB or nurses to sign that he was not present at checkups or the birth. Keep every email, text or voicemail from him (and watch what you send back, you need to be on your best behavior in any potential custody sutuation.) Check the laws in your state for recording phone calls or in-person conversations without the other party‚Äôs permission, and if you can do it, get him on the record saying these cruel or dismissive or crazy things. Cultivate your friendships, especially with people who also knew him - you‚Äôre going to need those character witnesses if you end up in court. And of course, no excessive drinking or taking drugs, even if the greeen stuff is legal in your state (the family courts don‚Äôt give a damn about your medical license, I can assure you.)

I went through a very unexpected and nasty divorce, and my biggest mistake re: custody was crawling into my shell and just wanting my time with my very young son to be just the two of us and no one else. My ex had half-a-dozen other preschool parents who could say ‚Äúoh yes, we‚Äôve have play dates in the park with mr exruby and little ruby‚Äù or ‚ÄúMr exruby seems confident and outgoing, but ruby seems quiet and timid and not very strong‚Äù (no shit, I was trying to survive the collapse of an abusive marriage).

My ex was eventually stupid/hubristic enough to make a false drug/alcohol addiction accusation against me (guess what? They take that stuff very seriously, so when someone is accused but then tests clean for six months and volunteers to do another six months if the court wants more proof, they take the lie very seriously, too) and I won primary custody, but I was so lucky he was that stupid. Everything else ‚Äòvisible‚Äô or able to be proved with evidence and eyewitnesses made him the better parent, because I was so devastated by my husband leaving me that I much preferred spending my time with my son just together in our little apartment, playing games and reading books and not enrolling him in after-school classes that promised to make him a tech genius aged three. But the court can‚Äôt see your amazing bonding time at home. You need the receipts that you were there, you parented like a crazy person as is the American way (Yes, immigrant here), and that he wasn‚Äôt interested.

Best of luck, honestly. You will get to a happy place. It probably won‚Äôt be happy 100% of the time, but very few things are. Four years later and I just had a lovely shared birthday celebration for my son with my ex. It can happen, and even if it doesn‚Äôt...you've got this, mama, and reach out here anytime you need xox"
6482,">And/or if you get involved in a moderately conservative church (no need to go to crazy awful right-wingers, but just old-fashioned traditional people), they'll bend over backwards to support you if you're pregnant and left by a transgender man. They'll be happy you're keeping the pregnancy.

I started to mention this, but I know how this sub feels about religion, lol.

But I boldly second this, b/c these people will wrap around you. They will bring you food. They will help you survive the critical crunch you are in right now. 

&#x200B;"
6483,">Plus there are plenty of gay men who would love to have children today. I'm just not sure that discomfort with vaginas should have a direct correlation to deadbeats. 

Discomfort with women, you mean. Yes, their discomfort/orientation away from women means that they should not ""sire"" children. They can adopt, if they want to raise children. Gay or straight, if you're a man who impregnated a woman and then skipped out, you're a deadbeat dad."
6484,I think she's pointing out the claim of dysphoria being used as a 'get out of obligation free' card. It's beyond belief to imagine his gender is so important and yet so fragile that it mustn't be disturbed by her pregnancy when he was nutting inside her a scant few months ago.
6485,:D
6486,I‚Äôm really sorry you had to go through that. He sounds like a complete jerk. I hope his parents at least told him he was acting like a prick?
6487,"Well ofc, that‚Äôs standard narcissist strategy to turn it around on you. I noticed you wrote ‚Äúhad a teaching job.‚Äù Im supportive of transpeople having employment opportunities that don‚Äôt include prostitution but not supportive of the trans agenda thrown at children, if he was teaching children. Sounds like he quit since you wrote ‚Äúhad.‚Äù What you wrote about your abortion definitely hits my heart and mind and I wish men understood or cared. It‚Äôs scary a lot of young women, and also older women too, don‚Äôt know what an abortion entails. It‚Äôs a lot to go through. I hope you find some peace and comfort from within, your ex sucks"
6488,DARVO.
6489,"I second this, Planned Parenthood incredibly important to those of us in conservative states, especially ones that have work requirements for Medicare. I've used PP for Pap smears, bc, when I haven't had insurance and had wonderful abortion care at one when I was in high school."
6490,Utah?

6493,Bingo! Right on time.
6494,"Truthfully it feels no different than the ""momma's boy"" relationships I have been in beforehand where your emotional needs go unmet. They require you to care for them when they're sick but are completely emotionally unavailable. They don't do basic adult things like cook or clean or even their own taxes! I couldn't get my ex to even apply for jobs on their own or take over paying a single bill or even go grocery shopping. I'm starting to realize I just got pushed into a caregiver role and I should have noticed the signs, especially when they literally would say things such as, ""It's like I'm going through a second puberty."" and liken themselves to being a teenager. But of course the relationship started with a man who didn't come across this way and I was blinded by who they used to be... I want to work on myself and my children because fucking hell am I tired of being so depressed. I have felt like I'm drowning lately and I'm so glad I just posted here...I never expected the support. At least I have practice being a mother already, right? Is it wrong that that makes me actually laugh?

I've been exploring the resources more and more. I just initially didn't qualify for some of the assistance but I should now. I have an appointment with a caseworker on Tuesday so I hope they will help me fill in the blanks. "
6495,True that!
6496,"I bet she was asking for some attention, and wanting a little comforting.
"
6497,"Perhaps. But it doesn't make sense to me that a ""transitioned"" repressed gay man would continue dating, and engage in intercourse with his partner and consequently impregnate her, before leaving her."
6498,"Probably for the same reasons married men come to find they‚Äôre ‚Äúsubmissive‚Äù and just need to live out their femdom or even ‚Äúwife hate‚Äù fantasies. 

Probably for the same reasons men come to find they can‚Äôt get off unless they‚Äôre choking something or sucking on a toe. 

Porn. "
6499,"New children can really trigger narcissists. For narcissistic women, a new baby can be a good supply until the child stops BF and starts having independent needs and personality. But for narcissistic males the child is just sucking away all his glory and all his victims since the moment of conception. He‚Äôs realizing that he losing the spotlight so he has to do something more grandiose to fill the holes in his heart. Narcissists are known to use hypersexuality as a coping mechanism, this includes things like AGP and bisexuality "
6500,That shit makes me so angry üôÑüò†
6501,If that's the option Utah is the best place to go to make that a legal reality. Downside is that the twins would almost certainly wind up growing up in Utah. 
6502,"Men are the only sex who produce sperm to impregnate women, human reproduction doesn't work otherwise."
6503,"All of this. No phone calls, if he calls let it go to voice mail and save what he leaves. Email and text messages for everything. Change any passwords he might know and any password recovery hints (name of your old school, mom, dog, etc) he could possibly guess. Do not expect him to play fair and assume that his fellow transes will give him help with a high level of deviousness and tech savvy. Plan accordingly. "
6504,"Yeah. I hesitated to say that too, but honestly, given the danger in aspects of progressive churches (there's one famous one in NC that's gone trans-insane and I had to stop going), it's six of one half a dozen of the other if you need a group of basically decent people who are trying to live according to some moral principles. It's one set of imperfections vs another (not talking about scary promise-keeper churches, but just more traditional ones).

I do believe in a ""power greater than myself"" but consider Christ a metaphor. Churches are just helpful structures in the US anyway through which to channel some the needs for spiritual community and service. I've learned to mistrust Buddhist temple groups because they seem to be full of men on the make who use a lot of unfamiliar language to get women to distrust their instincts. I know others are agnostic and atheistic. 

But you're right--for a pregnant single mom of twins, a solid traditional church in a mid-size city like Wilmington would be the most realistic place in 2019 to get support. "
6505,"I am anti-religion and strongly third this idea.  Have met some conservative Methodists who are kind folk, might want to check them out. "
6506,I hope so! They were probably just grateful they didn't have to underwrite another one of his mistakes on an ongoing basis. Just one pay out. Good riddance.
6507,"Thank you. <3 No, he taught adults at a for-profit. He quit to go back to graduate school out east so he could experience being a *new girl* at college. Ugh. Heaven help the people he was TAs for. We haven't spoken in years. My life is much better. Now I have the teaching job!"
6508,I have never seen that acronym before. That is a super helpful concept.
6509,Funny enough there are five more PP clinics in UT than in ID!
6510,"I obviously can't vouch for every single PP branch, but... they're there. They have information. They can provide you with contact to other resources that you need. I'm very sorry for the poor service that you received, you deserved better.

"
6511,What? I‚Äôve always been a staunch supporter of planned parenthood. I went to them when I was poor and desperate and now I donate yearly to give back what I can. Please educate me if you have any links or can point me in the right direction. 
6512,"Haha yes you do know how to be mom! Every relationship I‚Äôve been in with a man the caregiving has fallen to me. So don‚Äôt blame yourself there, were up against a huge patriarchal culture that is out of our control. Maybe there are a couple grown men out there who can hold their own haha. 

Yay! Glad you have an appt at social services. Yes if USA there is emergency application timelines, like they have to grant within three days, but there‚Äôs a lot more stuff they will review when you go to your appointment. Make sure that to remember that if something they are doing doesn‚Äôt seem right, like the income on your notice isn‚Äôt adding up or you just don‚Äôt understand what they are talking about, that you always have the right to appeal. It‚Äôs actually not that arduous of a process like a court hearing is. Hopefully it just goes smoothly and they send you to some good resources!"

6514,"Mere conjecture on my part.

To compensate his internalized homophobia, again many gays and lesbians that come out later in life do the same. 

Also, maybe because for many homophobes nowadays trans is much better than gay. When OP actually got pregnant and it finally clicked as actual reality for him and would have to deal with the consequences, he got scared and ran.

The fantasy is always better than reality."
6515,"I KNOW I'll regret asking, but what is 'wife hate'?"
6516,That would explain why they literally turned into a slut over night but I can't pretend to understand. I know they're off fucking someone else and they're probably in someone else's bed right now. I wonder what my ex says about me in all of this but I have a feeling I don't exist to the new people in their life. 
6517,"I lost my marriage to my pregnancy/our son. My narcissistic ex just could not handle any diversion of the spotlight from him. It was a horrible, traumatic time when I should have been the happiest I‚Äôd ever feel in life.

It‚Äôs alright now (we divorced when my son was 2) but I still think ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô sometimes. I dread when my son gets older and asks why our marriage ended. It‚Äôs not his fault - not even for a second - but it‚Äôs absolutely because he was conceived and born and my ex couldn‚Äôt handle having his narcissistic supply reduced to make room for a needy baby... thank god I have a lot more years to practice an answer."

6522,"PP is going full on along with transgender ideology, not sure why, funding, to save themselves from extinction. But agree, anything is better than nothing for teens and poor/broke women! Don't like discussing because conservatives use that info to confirm their own biases rather than acknowledge any service is better than no service or forced motherhood/undetected cancer !"
6523,"PP is going all-out to support TiMs and provide services, including hormones from the first appointment according to a lot of trans posters on other subs.

It‚Äôs still one of the best/only resources struggling women have for family planning, but I have thought that all of us who donate should be sending letters saying we support reproductive health services for women, not validation therapy for delusional men. "
6524,"He sounds like the 
""Fuck this is going to be work"" variety."
6525,"I respect that conclusion.
It's always good to get differing perspectives on things!
Thank you for responding to me!"
6526,"Where men are encouraged to gaslight and abuse their wives and get off on doing so. They congregate online to talk about their fantasies or even actions they claim they‚Äôve done. 

It‚Äôs basically a ‚Äúkink‚Äù for gaslighting ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù or unsuspecting women. And it can be executed in a plethora of ways."
6527,"Thank goodness having your son together showed you his truest colors. And you got out, which is hard. That‚Äôs sad you couldn‚Äôt enjoy your pregnancy. But it‚Äôs good you got out "
6528,This has literally nothing to do with stereotypes. Men are adult human males. Women are adult human females. Male is the sperm-bearing sex class. Female is the ova-bearing sex class. Words have meaning.

6533,"Excellent! Reminder that Jazz Jennings' mom ascribed gender roles to him when he was ONE YEAR OLD, thus brainwashing him into thinking he must be a 'girl'. He had no chance. 

    JEANETTE: Some of the earliest memories I have of Jazz not acting like a stereotypical boy 
    were before 'she' was even two years old. 'She' gravitated toward all the feminine toys and
    only wanted to dress up in clothes from 'her' big sister's chest, with all her little costumes 
    and everything.

    As Jazz's mom, Jeanette Jennings, told Barbara Walters on the ABC News program ""20/20"", the child had 
    asked her, ""Mommy, when's the good fairy going to come with her magic wand and change, you know, 
    my genitalia?"" 
    'She' was 2 at the time.

(I wonder where Jazz got the idea that he's a 'girl' and had the wrong *genitalia*!)

Edit: And here's Jazz's take on him first realizing he's totally not a boy...

    JAZZ: When I was two years old, I remember there was this pink cassette tape that had the word Barbie 
    on it. And I really loved that tape. I looked around the whole house for that tape. I really wanted 
    to play with Barbie! I don‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs just some weird fragmented memory that I have."

6535,"Nice and succinct. It demonstrates why trans activists spend most of their time going after feminists, rather than conservatives or men. Our method of liberation from gender protects the body, and indicts society. That's the true threat to them. It's also how you know it's a MRA movement in disguise. They never, never, NEVER go after men."
6536,"This is a really great resource for new subs like me who are feeling a bit overwhelmed by the discourse of this sub. I think I am gender critical....but I also thought I was liberal.

6539,"I disagree with ""legitimacy"" and ""roles.""

Transgender people (both TIMs and TIFs - especially TIFs) do not adhere to their adopted gender's ROLES.  They perform gender  superficially, but TIFs still have babies and ""chestfeed"" *{big eye roll},* and TIMs in general don't want to perform tasks traditionally left to womenfolk, like housework and babysitting.  Some of them fetishize housewives by dressing up like June Cleaver, but nothing they're doing is meant to create a warm, spotless home with the smell of *actual* cookies baking.  Few of them talk about giving up their lives to change dirty diapers.

""Legitimacy"" isn't the correct word.  I have pointed out several times on this sub:  If you go to all those ""flyover"" states, if you go to rural Amreica ... you will find women who do NOT perform superficial womanhood.  Women with short, masculine haircuts.  Women who NEVER wear makeup or dresses.  Women who are expected to perform all the same tasks the men do.  Men who teach their daughters the same things they teach their sons.  I am not saying rural America is perfect, I'm not saying they're gender critical.  But when I leave my city every year on road trips to rural America, I am reminded of how people in cities clearly have no idea what's going on in rural, mostly conservative, areas.  Clearly, conservatives don't believe in the legitimacy of superficial gender performance, either."

 We also believe that the reason women are oppressed it based on our biology. The fact that we are smaller and that we gestate, not because people are biased against femininity. 

There are resources and graphics avaible for a basic introduction, but I would reccomend mostly doing your own research. A lot of people have misconceptions so looking at second wave feminist writings as a foundation is more helpful I find."
6561,"I wouldn't worry about labelling yourself, just keep an open mind and accumulate knowledge in your own personal search for the truth. I find labels often make people end up supporting things they normally wouldn't just because they're under that particular ideological umbrella, most here were trans-positive once for this very reason."
6562,"""Liberal"" has a couple of meanings.

In general in America and maybe similarly in some other countries, ""liberal"" means ""progressive"" which also gets associated with the Democratic and Green parties.

In general in Europe and some other countries elsewhere, ""liberal"" means something more like ""conservative"" does in America. It refers to people who want free-market capitalism and less taxation.

If you went back 100 years, or were referring to political factions 100-300 years ago, a liberal would refer to a person who supported democratic republics, states with constitutions that defined the rights of their citizens, and capitalist economics. Contrast them to socialists, supporters of monarchy, supporters of various despotic rulers, and fascists.

Radical feminism was started by women with Marxist/socialist backgrounds, so radical means ""to the root"", not extreme. The last definition of liberal is the one that is relevant when we talk about ""liberal feminism."" We're talking about feminism that seeks to make women ""equal citizens"" within the liberal socioeconomic system that exists, but they don't want to radically change the system. Liberal feminists are reformists. Radical feminists don't believe women can be ""equal"" in liberalism at all, and seek to overthrow all patriarchal systems, including liberal ones."
6563,There is a liberal vs. radical videos in the sidebar which is a really good breakdown on them by Lierre Keith.
6564,"Just to chime in-- I am absolutely gender critical and liberal. TRAs don't get to define liberalism. If we say ""libfem"" it typically refers to someone accepting trans ideology and not actual feminism, but it doesn't necessarily apply to other political ideas. You'll find a lot of women here are liberal (some are conservative but never like Trump supporters-- GC feminism and Trump ideology are mutually exclusive). I'm liberal and I'm tired of other liberals and I hate that important ideas llike universal health care and fair elections are being pushed to the wayside for cafe discussions about pronouns."

You may be immune to all this as you're conservative and male (transactivists often target primarily women, and especially lesbian feminists), but just wanted to give you a heads up."
6568,">Conservatism is about personal liberty 

No it's not. Most broadly, political conservatism serves to maintain (or ""conserve"") the *status quo*, whatever it may be, which entails a particular economic system and a set of norms/mores. In non-egalitarian societies such as ours, conservatism is characteristically anti-egalitarian, and also authoritarian. It's quite literally the opposite of personal freedom, at least for commoners."
6569,"If you are talking about libertarian conservatives, you‚Äôre correct, but traditional conservatives definitely want to keep gender roles and many other traditional social aspects in place"
6570,"Conservatism tends to be about tradition, keeping things the same or returning to an idealized past. Conservatism, overall, is not about personal liberty anymore than progressivism is. These are broad political terms that go back to some 1700s French king, maybe before for all I know. You don't get to redefine it now.

Overall, conservatives believe in traditional sex roles. In general, conservatives have resisted women being able to defy them, and have resisted men being able to defy them."
6571,"In general though, conservatives want to see women in what they call 'traditional roles'. So this is not wrong"
6572,"> Conservatism is about personal liberty

Not really. You may think that because of the American right wing, which identifies as conservative but also has a strong right-libertarian streak. The personal liberty aspect belongs to the libertarianism side, not really to conservatism. In fact conservatism tends towards authoritarianism, which is the opposite of personal liberty.

Another political philosophy that emphasizes personal liberty is classic liberalism (look it up, it's not what American right wingers call a lib'rul.)"

6581,">Also, it's hard to define the GCF viewpoint in regards to sports. Whether there should be separate leagues for the sexes or one coed league (for lack of a better term) since there is no gender. It's especially more confused and confusing, now that TiMs are becoming younger and younger and the laws of different lands are inconsistent and countries and counties seemingly don't know what to do about trans identified athletes in regards to amateur and school sports.            

By ""gender"", we mean the stereotypes (gender roles, behaviors, etc.) associated with someone's sex. ""Gender"" is simply a social construct (girls like pink, boys like cars, women should stay at home, while men should be the breadwinners, etc.)  The word gender has been used interchangeably with sex, but that wasn't the original intention.         

As far as spaces, sports, etc., they should be separated by sex, as they always have been. Women fought very hard to have these spaces because they were left out (sports), and/or vulnerable (dressing rooms). Separate spaces ensured some level of safety, a way to participate in both public life, & activities usually reserved for men.        

There already are plenty of co-ed leagues for people just interested in playing if it's just a matter of getting to participate in some type of athletics. However, competitive sports need separation by sex -- both at the lower levels & top levels, otherwise, girls/ women will be pushed out by males that have biological advantages. No one says trans athletes shouldn't get to play sports, just that they should play with the appropriate sex. The younger cases of trans people going into sports really highlights the problem, when you see males just self declaring they are ""girls"" & getting onto teams. Several have now broke records & this just got started.         

What people are failing to realize is that issues, like playing sports with the opposite sex because of feelings, is not some human right. There's a lot of factors that could impede, or conflict with an athlete's ability to compete... sometimes it's just unfortunate, or the result of choices made, but it's not right to make athletic organizations accept any individual, especially when it would make it unfair to an entire class of people (women/ girls.)"
6582,"It‚Äôs not really confusing. Don‚Äôt really care about how they go about making new leagues, but men have no business competing in women‚Äôs only sports because of the innate biological advantage.

Sure a portion of women are stronger than some men, but just as some teens are stronger than some adults too, doesn‚Äôt mean a grown adult should be allowed to compete against kids.

If that adult purposefully stunted their own growth, that‚Äôs their problem and still doesn‚Äôt allow them to compete against kids."

At one point Jazz wanted to leave the house, and Jeanette tried to shame him into staying by calling him too immature to dilate. *Then why did you pressure him into the surgery?* And of course his doctors and TLC and ""trans-friendly"" orgs like Mermaids love it.

6592,"Hi! I recently discovered the gender critical movement, and there are some aspects I might be confused about. Gender critical persons, as I understand it, deny any legitimacy to genders, as they are a harmful social construct. However it seems that this subs emphasizes a lot the biological aspect, and considers people with different biologies fairly differently, which seems, in the end, recreating genders, since different biologies gets you different social consideration?"
6593,"THIS. Although, maybe some do experience them, and we're just soulless."
6594,"Thanks for his explanation. Can you tell me if I‚Äôve got the right idea here about gender-critical feminism:

Sex = biological. Gender = performative(?), socially constructed.

I have spent years learning about socially constructed gender roles and how damaging they are for both women and men. I‚Äôve been of the belief that these gender roles shouldn‚Äôt be placed as ‚Äúin line‚Äù with the sex of a person. 
For example: wearing a dress (categorised as feminine) is in line with being a biological woman and it is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúnatural‚Äù by society‚Äôs standards. I‚Äôve been championing for more women to join football teams, I‚Äôm a teacher and I regularly point out everyday sexism in class and how ‚Äúgirls can like blue‚Äù, ‚Äúboys can wear dresses‚Äù, etc. I challenge the stereotypes that people around me say in everyday conversation. Basically - I consider myself a feminist. 

However. What I‚Äôm taking from the gender critical movement is that with the trans community become more vocal and accepted, there is a hypocrisy in the above theory. If I tell boys in my class that it‚Äôs okay to wear a dress, then why do trans men (MtF) feel the need to identify as women because they like to wear dresses? Isn‚Äôt the point of being a feminist that you don‚Äôt want gender roles and stereotypes to exist? By allowing that biological male to identify as a women because he likes makeup, wearing pink and other traditionally ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô things, doesn‚Äôt that undermine the whole movement away from gender stereotypes?! Accepting MtF as ‚Äòwomen‚Äô confirms that only those who are women can wear dresses?

My head is a mess. I‚Äôm trying to get my head around this.

Any help would be appreciate here!!!!"
6595,"Nicely summarized.  (Sorry.  Just retired women's studies prof here.) 

I'd also go so far as to say femininity is dependent on the existence of two sexes, and the dominance of the male sex in a patriarchal system, and isn't just some free-floating concept."

 I am sorry that you see a lot of it, it is more common to see in babies and preschoolers, but that is usually because they are not able to hide the disjunction as well or cannot hide it at all (babies) outside their oarents' influence. As you say it presents more strongly when children are with parent. However, the present you describe is not necessarily the case. Neither does the reasoning in your post re surgery to be honest, it doesn't really make sense to me - could you expand? Many MBP cases are with children groomed into it from a very early age and they take on the narratives themselves. 

Jazz was homeschooled parts of his childhood then I think permanently after a certain age. He would have been with his mother constantly. Would not be necessarily have it as a primary diagnostic though. 


Jazz' mother shows startlingly obvious primary and secondary  criteria for MBP. My post was a bit tongue in cheek, but I mean it seriously."

6610,"Yeah, that adds to the fishiness."
6611,"And they accuse us of thinking everything is a patriarchal plot.

Not sexual reproduction, silly boys. Not the material reality of our biology, which exists whether or not we can describe it with words or study it with science."
6612,"> However it seems that this subs emphasizes a lot the biological aspect,

This is how I see it: the biological aspect is that men and women have different roles in reproduction, in particular, that only women menstruate, can get pregnant, bear the foetus, give birth and breastfeed.  That different role results in some different physiology between males and females.  Denying that this biological difference exists would be to deny reality.  But that's the extent of the biological difference. 

This biological difference does lead to some social consequences but that's unavoidable and need not be a bad thing.  For example, it's not intrinsically wrong that society treats a heavily pregnant women differently to an able bodied adult man.  It depends on how she is treated differently.

However, where it certainly goes wrong is where the social consideration extends beyond what is a necessary consequence of different reproductive biology.  The whole edifice of gender roles erected by society to oppress women goes far beyond anything necessary to account for different reproductive biology.  It's that edifice that radfems want to destroy."
6613,"You‚Äôre making perfect sense. No one here can get their head around it either. Trans ideology is nonsensical. But it *sounds* really nice and progressive, which is why so many gender con conforming people start out supporting it and thinking they‚Äôre trans themselves. If you ever start to think about it critically and ask questions, you get shut down. Because it can‚Äôt hold up to scrutiny. The entire concept of gender identity is bullshit, no one should base their identity off of a collection of gender stereotypes that define the gender role they wish to perform. That‚Äôs not an identity. It‚Äôs simply a part of their personality."
6614,"That is exactly the line of thought that made me peak. They can't define ""woman"" without using stereotypes. They claim trans ideology is subversive but it is really just reinforcing the existing conditions but they want to recategorize themselves. 

If it was honestly just ""gender"" and had nothing to do with sex, they wouldn't call themselves transwomen they would call themselves just feminine, feminine men specifically I don't mean ""women and femes"" like some queer theory groups do.  

In theory, TRAs also believe that sex=biology and gender=expectations, the societally constructed aspect. After all, they hold up the pedophile who created ""gender identity."" However, they like to blur the lines with these definitions since they would then have to admit that they are not women, that they are lacking in womanhood in some aspect (all aspects). They wont use femnine for gender and female for sex, they purposefully want to use woman for both. Some insist that they are ""biologically female"" since they claim that biology determined their gender identity. Claiming to feel like a woman doesn't mean anything. They are relying on sterotypes so they refrence things like makeup or princesses. Feeling discomfort in your male body doesn't make you a woman, and neither does feeling giddy imagining being a woman. They both use women as a frame of reference for their understanding while also rejecting the notion that sex has anything to do with it. 

This doesn't necessarily make you a radical feminist but it would make you gender critical and often labeled as a ""TERF"" although honestly just being a woman can cause that."
6615,"This is exactly why I take issue with the transgender movement. I honestly don't care very much about bathrooms or what individual trans people do, etc. I care about the regression of society after all the work feminists have put into dismantling gender by giving legitimacy to these sexist ideas through legislation, changing language, changing norms, etc.

I'm cool with trans people who have legit dysphoria over their body transitioning and even changing their legal sex as an accommodation for a mental health issue (because society's gender expectations often create the mental health aspects of being trans). But ideally, they should be comfortable performing any gender roles without needing new pronouns or body modification and society as a whole should be moving into that direction. But the trans movement is pushing us in the opposite direction"

6647,"The irony of twoXchromosomes, silencing and condemning xx people who criticise xy people."
6648,Welcome. Feel free to acknowledge biological reality to your heart's delight.
6649,"Hi, welcome to the dark side. We have cookies.







 I used to be active on two X a few years ago. It's changed beyond recognition, but appreciate what it was and I learned valuable things there. The lesson I now take from two X that women need female focused or exclusive spaces, and that needs to be affirmed, otherwise males take over and eventually silence or push  women out. 





Reddit did a number on Two X by making it a default sub, which drew a lot of unwanted attention and troll posts. I left around this time and went to snark on troll X for a bit, which seemed to keep the twox spirit for longer but now I see going a similar way, just with more memes. 



There is nothing transphobic about affirming the need for female spaces or that there are biological differences between men and women. That's why we have, to use your example, the basic division of men and women's  sport im the first place. 




Hormones don't change body structure, muscle mass, or male physiology. Even the supposed 'weakening' effect of oestrogen is nuanced as oestrogen strengthens bones too. 





Science is not transphobic.  You're not transphobic. The people who shut down any  questioning of the wisdom of allowing male bodied people in female spaces where biology matters (like toilets, changing rooms, refuges, and sports) are misogynists, plain and simple."
6650,"I was banned long ago for a similar offense. There was a discussion about uterus transplants and TIMs were gushing about how they wanted it to be studied more so they could carry their own children. One of them said they'd like to get a uterine transplant so they could experience an abortion, and I hit peak trans. Just no. "
6651,To be honest the only part of your story I find surprising was that TwoX had actual female moderator so recently.  
6652,"It's so weird that a sub named TwoX is ""anti-TERF"", because most trans activists think biology is transphobic"
6653,TwoXchromosomes is a joke. More like everythingexcept2xchromosomes
6654,That sub says that they've banned SWERFs as well now? Why the fuck is being anti-prostitution so wrong that it gets you banned from a women's sub? These people are totally brainwashed. So sad.
6655,"I was just talking about your story to my friend. Glad to find your post here because this boggles my mind that the trans community has become so toxic against any pushback to their agenda that they have begun trying to silence it. I will say that men and women have the freedom to do whatever they wish for themselves, but when it comes to sporting, it has to end there. 

I recently attended a female roller derby event with all-stars from every state. Teams that had trans-women on their roster absolutely crushed the other teams with all biological women. When a trans-woman was able to score, they did. The score differences were in the hundreds. It completely destroyed the integrity of a sport that was supposed to empower women. It‚Äôs a shame that trans-women are so lost in wanting to feel accepted that they are declaring war on biological women and stomping all over the sports that helped bolster their status to where it is now. "
6656,"Reddit names can be misleading e.g.  the lesbians sub is not for lesbians, it's for men to post lesbian porn, the feminism sub is controlled by a male MRA, actuallesbians is for transbians not actual lesbians and 2Xchromosomes has evolved to mostly promote the interests of people with XY chromosomes."
6657,"I‚Äôm sorry they kicked you out. I honestly hate that sub because of what it does to unsuspecting women. They will go in there unwittingly thinking it‚Äôs a women‚Äôs space, post a detailed sex assault or DV story, and then at least two MRAs will instacomment something really shitty. I know there are men who scan that sub looking for new posts with rape or abuse in the title. I was told in one of my posts that I was hurting male rape victims by using the term ‚Äúrape culture‚Äù when describing my experience. Men are just so bold and invasive. It‚Äôs been well known for a while you can‚Äôt post anything about women in there, only TIMs, who ironically have XY chromosomes. Welcome!"

And don't even get me started on the name ‚Äì there should be nothing wrong with having a place to discuss being biologically female without having to include and pander to males.

6686,"Dont you just love the hypocrisy that the sub is literally called ""two x chromosomes"" and yet they want to minimize sex-based differences between males and females."
6687,"I have posted this on that thread in twochromosomes:

>This sub antagonizes women who do not attack, but think critically about the differences in bodies between born men and women. 
But you are apparently not allowed to think as a biological woman, because then you are viciously attacked with the slur TERF. Even if you don't have anything against mtf at all, but think reasonably about the fact that bodies having gone through male puberty are stronger and have an unfair advantages on people with two x chromosomes on the sport field, you just losely will contemptuously call me or anyone else with a different opinion from yourself a terf. It's very agressive to use a slur like that, you know? Women on here are not allowed to think, but others are allowed to hatefully attack women with the term terf? Doesn't seem like a safe space for women anymore here, now does it. And certainly not a sub where free debate is encouraged.

>Well I will call you attackers of thinking biological women a slur too, and it is this: IDIOT HANDMAIDEN (IH) or CONQUERING INVADER OF FEMALE SPACES (CIOFS). Because that's exactly what you are by screeching: terf terf terfs fucking suck terfs must be beaten up etc.

>And you will block and censor me, because you are just a bunch of flipping hateful cowards pandering to the agressive terf shouting people (or you are the indignified terf shouters yourself)."

6690,"I‚Äôm totally late to this party but any ‚Äúfemale‚Äù subreddit moderated by men is by definition a joke. Sorry you had to get caught up in that & deal with all this drama. 

Biological reality is reality. Men have physical advantages in sport over women. Men cannot become women by injecting themselves with estrogen. Say this and say it again and again. It is the truth and no amount of banning, censorship, or social contagion will change it. 

I‚Äôm just thankful for this sub and the powerful strong women within it. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
6691,Of course you did. It's 2019.
6692,"Thanks for letting me know which sub not to visit.  ANY sub that bans a person for their personal views is in the wrong.  Do they want you to pretend to agree with them even if you don't?  Or just keep quiet? 
 Wow, how empowering.  

Sorry that happened to you.  I might understand if you were promoting physical violence or something else equally dangerous, but it's a fucking OPINION.  Last time I checked, we were still entitled to those.  Women are shooting themselves in the foot with this handmaidenry."

6705,"it all comes down to if you think ‚Äúwomanness‚Äù is essential versus a construct. if you believe that the category of ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is something determined by genes instead of culture, then transwomen can never really be women. if you believe that ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is primarily determined by culture, then woman means gender, nothing else, and is determined by fluid cultural constructs. and genes are much less important. 

it‚Äôs not a argument that is ‚Äúconclusive‚Äù by any means. science says, that beyond gestation and lactation, there are almost no essential differences between male and female physiology. and that individual differences are due to a gendered world. which would mean ‚Äúfemale‚Äù or ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is mainly constructed.

"
6723,"Well, I suppose in any uterine implant into a man - if it were to ever happen as we lost our fucking minds as a society - a pregnancy would not be sustainable and an abortion (and complete removal of uterine implant) would be necessary as a miscarriage could not complete naturally. That is if they realized there had been a miscarriage before life threatening infection set in, because uh, how would they know without any external signs of the miscarriage?

So I suppose at least he is realistic about the outcome of this kind of medical experimentation? Just kidding. He‚Äôs just a selfish and vile lout. 

A friend of mine‚Äôs daughter just lost her pregnancy at 20 weeks and had to go through labour to birth her stillborn baby. It was obviously a painful and traumatic experience. Only a narcisstic asshole would think that getting pregnant - through very expensive means and at great risk to patient and fetus - just to abort sounds like a grand old idea. I have had a surgical abortion and it was the best choice for me but you know what would have been better? Not getting pregnant in the first place. But you know, when the birth control fails guess whose body is at risk of the pregnancy (hint: not the man)?

After two years of therapy, I realised that there were a myriad of reasons why I was unhappy and uncomfortable being female and with my female body, and it sure wasn't the fact that I was really a man.

My point in sharing that is that I really, really don't hate transgender people. I support everyone's right to live however they wish to live and to be comfortable in themselves. What I do not support is trying to totally distort reality, deny biology, and put women at risk, which as everyone here knows is exactly what is happening in the politics of 'gender identity' today.

6758,"You can't link to the comment because they removed it (of course), and I'm pretty sure linking directly to TwoX encourages brigading, which I absolutely don't condone.

I was however able to read the comment by clicking on your username. Thank you for defending me, I appreciate the support."

6760,"It takes a good 50+ years to get a clear picture of the long-term effects of any medication.  My heart breaks for all the GNC kids whose bodies are becoming guinea pigs in the name of fake woke-ness.

I was put on an SSRI antidepressant as a kid/early teen.  I'm just now learning the long-term consequences of this decision which may very well have saved my life.  "
6761,You may well be banned just for posting here.
6762,"I got banned on my last account (I switch often for security hygiene) and the reason was something silly - refusing to back down about rape crisis shelters needing to have gatekeeping or be female only, I think."
6763,[deleted]
6764,"I was banned from posting on TwoX preemptively too and I wasn't sure if it was because I had posted here or in other subs that they may consider hostile.  Either way, I hadn't posted in the sub for at least two years, never anything negative from what I recall, but I was still banned.

I thought it was because I had posted here, but I'm not too sure.

Regardless, I believe it had to do with my views on the transgender movement."
6765,"Yeah, I've seen people pull others up on commenting or posting here. I don't care, really. People are free to dismiss or disagree with me purely on the basis I've posted here, and I'm free to completely ignore it."
6766,"Yes. I moderated posts and comments only, and did not have full permissions."
6767,Yes. The mod above can remove anyone below them and/or change their permissions. It‚Äôs crucial if you mod any sub that you set up two factor authentication on Reddit. I read a story on a sub for mods that the top mod account was hacked and all the mods were replaced with hackers. This happened on 21 subs overnight. This was a while ago. 
6768,"Of course they'll just have all men as their mods. What a fucking joke. But you know what, they can all sausage it up together, since I wouldn't doubt it if 80% or more users are men.      

So they either are too stupid to realize what's happened, or they are using the subs name to spread misogyny, by making women sound ridiculous.... with no one knowing it's almost all men.          

"
6769,"YES!

I was just banned there and I'm not even subbed and never posted there. 

"
6770,You might want to read the sidebar.
6771,"I wasn't banned, just removed as a moderator. I don't mind if they do ban me, I have no interest in further contributing. I'm glad I was, too! I wish you every success in your transition :)"
6772,"So you are not doubting OP but you are ignoring  the absence of things (ie deleted comments) to doubt her? She was removed as a moderator, but indicated last time I read she has not yet been banned. The fact they removed her as a moderator for her views is the issue here. They announced her removal in the sub, FFS, or do you doubt that too?

Even mods sleep, and they have one less of them now that OP was removed as a mod. As a default sub it will get votes/downvotes from a lot who rarely spend time there but see it pop up in their feeds - most of who probably see the absurdity. But don‚Äôt assume their views are actually welcome there. Other members on here have reported their comments being deleted or being banned for similar comments in that thread or others on TwoX. It is well known that TwoX is no longer a welcoming place for women who don‚Äôt play handmaiden."
6773,"Well, that's what happened. There are other people here who saw the comment that got me removed.

Edit: I added the comment I made to the post."
6774,"Oh God, really? I should get that checked by a doctor."
6775,"No, I'm not. I'm talking about male persons. Transwomen are male people.

I reject the notion that ""male"" and ""female"" are things you can become."

6777,The internalized sexism.
6778,The sub *is* for two x people - for keeping two x people in line for the benefit of xy people.
6779,"I think r/TwoXChromosomes was started before more people started to believe that transwomen are women. So they still  count transwomen as women, despite thes name of the sub. Which is pretty ridiculous."
6780,"Hopefully not the irony, because it's thick, heh."
6781,So inclusive it's exclusive of 2x persons. 
6782,Especially as about 70% of reddit is male. And they also have r/askwomen which is pretty much open to anyone.
6783,"The modern trans movement would disagree with you. It's become infinitely more regressive; instead of ""I was born a man but now I identify as a woman"" the language now does everything to delegitimize objective reality and biology as much as possible; trans people now say they were ""assigned"" a sex as if it were arbitrarily decided for them, and huge swaths of nonsensical bullshit on the internet is dedicated to telling women how a penis is biologically indistinguishable from a vagina, or how the penis is a female organ if the person identifies as female, etc.

Trans activism wants people to believe there is no harm to anyone in allowing a trans person to choose to be what they want, but the reality is that trans as an ideology relies on denial of objective reality and expects everyone around them to labor under an elaborate suspension of disbelief. Nobody is allowed to point out the emperor has no clothes, lest you be labelled a transphobic bigot, but trans people all day long love claiming idiotically that things like referring to abortion or menstration as women's health issues is ""problematic"" or ""transphobic"" (TIMs in particular seem to do this). It actively harms and undermines women and it's done (whether they realize it or not) to secure trans power above that of actual, natal women (and natal men), using their claims of victimhood and oppression as a bludgeon to bully their critics into silence. Trans activists then get to claim how much more superior and enlightened they are, when the reality is quite the opposite, and they tread deeper and deeper into denial about their own identity, lashing out at anything that risks damaging the facade. "
6784,"> You can‚Äôt dispute that fact any more than I can dispute the fact that I was born with brown eyes.

Well, eye color actually changes a lot through childhood."
6785,"Just a reminder to everyone- we affirm our space in part by reporting innapropriate posts. Thanks to the mods for cleaning shit up, but we have to do our part, too!"
6786,"I got frustrated with all the ""empowering"" content on TrollX.  Women referring to themselves as ""bad bitches"" or ""a snacc"".  Lots of ""eyeliner so sharp it could kill a man"" feminism."
6787,"Awesome, nice to see a fellow two X / troll X refugee.



This place is an oasis. "
6788,"Oh goodness you got me! /s 



I'll be more specific. No hormone treatment in the world takes changes a male into a female one, including its fundamental structure, muscle function, hips  and rib cage, skeletal structure, and other underlying physiological elements changed through male puberty. 










"
6789,JFC....have a mimosa. Have all the mimosas. 
6790,MRAs scan all the posts to say shitty things to rape survivors too. If you downvote a new post on Reddit it will get buried. They downvote rape survivors on there but there‚Äôs like 3-5 MRAs that stick around to prove their points and say misogynist things and be dismissive. They really need a warning on that sub not to post anything related to being a woman lol
6791,I got removed from there for defending a rape survivor who posted about the whole males being allowed in female shelters and women being booted for raising concerns. Twox is not two x friendly anymore...
6792,"Some of them are TiMs, so your banning makes sense. Sigh. "
6793,"Honestly, I think a lot of people who post personal bodily things to 2x aren't aware that 2x is increasingly being used as a tutorial by TIMs to mimic women under ""transwomen are women.""
"
6794,Mansplaining transformed? 
6795,"Most women trip all over themselves to simply hand the power over. We don't want to look mean, we always want to ""share"" and be cooperative."
6796,"Studies have shown that women don‚Äôt apply for jobs unless they meet the requirements 100%. Men will apply when they meet 40% of the requirements. This is is one of the reasons men get better paid jobs more often and means that even in a sub that‚Äôs supposed to be for women, most of the applicants for moderator will be male."
6797,"Its true- no conspiracy required, just autogynephiles doing their thing"
6798,"Most women have real lives to deal with, we don't have the luxury of spending all day on the internet as NEETs in our parents' basement."
6799,"Yes, it has been around since forever, it was one of the first subreddits meant for actual female people on reddit since reddit has ALWAYS skewed male. 

Once everyone started transtrending, the TIMs had to MeToo their way into the subreddit and the official stance was that gender feels are real and that's what makes us women.

They had a sticky for a while because so many trans people would post whiny questions about if they were included 

They tried to start an alternate subreddit called r/femmethoughts that was explicitly for women but without the ""transphobic"" connotations of twox.  I always refused to post there because I think its bullshit that they're literally telling women they think different, pink laydee thoughts.  Not all women are feminine etc etc."
6800,"TwoX is an older Reddit community. I don't think it's called that for any reason other than ""women have two X chromosomes"" - a statement which is now enough to get you banned from TwoXChromosomes. Funny world we live in!"
6801,"Haaaahahaha that reminds me, AskWomen is threads like, ‚ÄúLadies, what‚Äôs your thoughts on hosiery?‚Äù and we‚Äôll have a few users chiming in with, ‚ÄúAs a man...‚Äù

and i‚Äôm like, NO if I wanted AskMen I would have gone there.

Then a mod says it‚Äôs okay for men to add their opinions to threads like that because male opinions are also very important in AskWomen and many mods there are men.

Meh.

Reddit is a fucking ‚Äògood old boys‚Äô club."
6802,"Yep. Either ""as a man"" or ""as a transwoman""..."
6803,"They cannot possibly excuse this. A ""SWERF"" is just a woman who thinks sex work is bad for society. I'm supposed to believe that this is so bigoted it can get you *banned on sight*?

What, because some sex workers will be offended?

The existence of the despicable porn industry offends me. Why don't they gather around to validate my feelings instead? 

They're not even hiding it anymore. It's not even a political sub but they'll shun you just for having different opinions..."
6804,"> Does criticizing the fast food industry mean you hate Mcdonalds workers? No??

I've never heard them come up with a good response to this. I've used ""Am I anti-child because I'm opposed to child labor?"" with some success. "

I'm sorry that was taken away from you. Fucking men."

6808,"That‚Äôs how most of us also felt at one point. We were allies. At least I was. Let‚Äôs crush the patriarchy together! But then that wasn‚Äôt good enough. They couldn‚Äôt fight WITH us, they wanted TO BE US. LITERALLY. That was the real agenda. They actually love the stereotypical gender roles as long as they‚Äôre the ‚Äúother‚Äù gender. Hence the tits and the makeup and the high heels. They don‚Äôt give a fuck about what real women issues are. 
Sorry for the rant. You are welcome here! Last true safe space for WOMEN on Reddit. "
6809,"Isn't the whole ""truscum"" thing about cancelling transpeople that believe dysphoria is required to be trans? It sounds like you were thrown out with similar reasoning.

You might find comfort in r/detrans I know you only socially transitioned, but there might be people there that would benefit from your kindness and understanding."
6810,"Contrary to the propaganda about Gender Critical/RadFem's, very few of us started out ""hating transgender people."" We've mostly all had Peak Trans stories that shook us awake to the larger picture of what is happening, often what is happening behind the scenes. So, like you, we had a philosophy about acceptance and inclusiveness that got smashed flat by reality. 

I'm sorry you've had that experience. It stings for a while, and then you might get a hot passion for making sure they don't get to bull dose over women any more.  "
6811,That is a very reasonable stance...
6812,Yeah this seriously seems like a liability issue now that you mention it...who in their right minds would take on this risk financially?
6813,I agree with your first statement completely. 
6814,"That's okay, I don't mind. They can talk about me all they want. I haven't done anything wrong."
6815,So spicy.  That comment warms the cockles of my cold dead heart.
6816,"What other topics did they censor? Critical perspectives on prostituted women/""sex work"" I'm guessing?"
6817,"Handmaiden mods live in terror of being accused of being ""transphobic"" so they tend to err on the side of deletion."
6818,"> something like people born male have physical differences that makes it unfair for women to compete against them

This is exactly what I was removed for."
6819,"Yeah. I was banned, which was I take as a compliment... Honestly, I was a really faithful member for a long time...I was so angry and disappointed to see what it turned into. No hard feelings though.... As long as the incels are bombarding twox with hate there will be fewer trolls bothering this sub (an *actual* feminist subreddit.)"
6820,Can someone PM me this thread? Don't see it.
6821,Welcome:)
6822,"I'm slowly collecting the whole set.  I've got TwoX, TrollX, LateStageCapitalism, ChapoTrapHouse, askfeminists (that one incensed me)... I've got a couple more but I can't remember.  I go to comment on old favorite subs and can't because at some point in the past I said something offensive like ""pornography hurts women and children"".  "
6823,What are the consequences of this and do you have any reading for me? 
6824,I have like 70 hits for this sub on masstagger. I think they would've done it in 2018 when I got a bunch of bans from subs I never participated in.  If they do? oh well.
6825,"I never even made a statement. My only post on there wasn't even about women's rights, it was a random post about some state laws in Maryland. When I got my ban notice they said specifically that it related to my posting on a forum whose members were critical of 2x."
6826,WTF that's so weird. I wonder if they have a program to autoblock any GC subscribers or something. 
6827,"i am not expressing an opinion one way or another.  there is the ‚Äúessential‚Äù and ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù arguments/theories regarding both sex and gender. i went to graduate school in the american studies dept with a women‚Äôs studies focus. i am familiar with both sides, including biological research versus social research. am i required to profess a particular believe one way or another in order to post here? "
6828,"Wow so you really got at my comment. 
What I was saying was that there is some hope for the sub since there are other people expressing the same opinions as OP. 

""They announced her removal in the sub, FFS, or do you doubt that too?"" - such an unnecessary, and unnecessarily hostile, response to my comment really. 

I have zero doubt for OPs accounts of events, but I do believe, based on the other comments in that specific thread, that there are other people who echo the opinions of OP. "
6829,"Yeah I dont doubt that it happened, I really only meant to say that there are other people who agree with you who also posted there. Perhaps their comments will also be deleted too.

My point was that there is some hope for that sub (based on the fact that there are the other comments), and that there are people over there who also agree with the opinions you expressed, and the concerns that are being voiced in this sub. It really wasnt casting any doubt on you "

6832,There are.
6833,"I'm sure there are- it was the same on the actuallesbians sub, and LesbianActually. I am a lesbian and I got banned by lesbian-identified male mods on BOTH of them (for being openly gay). "
6834,"Haha the first part of this made me think you were saying ""two x-people"" as in two kinds of x-people: xx people and xy people."
6835,The name is literally more trans exclusionary than our own.  
6836,"If anything, it would make sense to say it's for anyone with two X chromosomes, including ~~cis~~women, transmen, non-binary, agender, etc. At least, that's how I'd try to be compliant if I decided to cave to the pressure."

6838,"It may change, but it's the same way most animals eyes change after infancy (initially blue in color) not really changing throughout childhood though. Eye color is predetermined by genes, unless there's damage/ interference of melanin. It probably wasn't the best analogy, (since eye color goes by the amount of melanin present) However, they are correct that there is a blueprint our bodies are made from, including eye color, unless something goes wrong. So I get the point they were making.

6840,It's never been TwoX friendly.
6841,I just now got removed. Never even been there before. I think it's because I posted on this thread earlier? All I posted was asking what was said.. 
6842,[deleted]
6843,Wait really? It‚Äôs literally called TWO X CHROMOSOMES. How do the trans moderators rationalize the title of the sub itself as not being transphobic? 
6844,[deleted]
6845,"Ugh, this disturbs me almost as much as seeing middle-aged lesbian-identified males advising 14-year-old lesbians on how to finger their girlfriends on r/actuallesbians. It's sickening that women have no where to go on reddit other than here or truelesbians. "
6846,"So, so accurate"
6847,I like how my comment was like the overwrought Judith Butler version of what you summed up with two words.
6848,Transplaining :)
6849,I think you nailed it. I know I shy away from mod duties because I would hate having to delete a comment or post someone put a lot of effort into because it breaks the rules.
6850,I've noticed this. A LOT.
6851,"I'm a bit late, but I genuinely do wish women had their own place on Reddit. Transgender bullshit is getting way out of hand and I find myself agreeing with so-called TERFs more and more every day."
6852,">Yep. Either ""as a man"" or ""as a transwoman""...

&nbsp;

Those two are the same thing. So, yes. Men's voices rising above women's in every mixed sex space, as per the past several millennia.
"
6853,"> What, because some sex workers will be offended?

I would say, rather because men who use prostitutes will be offended and, of course, catering to men's feels are what everything is about."
6854,"Turn the tables on them. Get a group of guys happy to 'tuck it back' for a night, and get them to smash the trans players on the other team. See how they like it."
6855,That and also their man hands and shoulders. Sometimes I look at progress pics or ‚Äúam I passing?‚Äù Type posts. I refrain from commenting where I‚Äôm not welcome but jfc those shoulders cannot be hidden. Im angry at any man who can see his shoulders and thinks it‚Äôs ok to play in women‚Äôs sports because he wants his gender ID validated. If they care about feminist issues then they must know that thousands of women are killed by their male partners and the men use their hands and shoulders to do it. I was very young when I realized just how much stronger man hands are than mine and how easily they can dominate me. TIMs who think they are women really suck. But there are some who stand with us
6856,They told us they wanted to crush the stereotypes but their goal all along was actually to just change them. 
6857,"Non-snarky question:

Out of genuine curiosity, what did you understand/conceptualize transgender people to be back when you considered yourself an ally?"
6858,"Thank you, that's a sub I haven't seen before, I'll definitely take a look and see if my experience or perspective might be helpful to anyone. I've shared it on other subs before in an attempt to help others.

> Isn't the whole ""truscum"" thing about cancelling transpeople that believe dysphoria is required to be trans? It sounds like you were thrown out with similar reasoning.

Burn the heretic ;)"
6859,"Now-a-days any trans person who advocates any form of ‚Äúgate keeping‚Äù gets called Truscum- basically anything other than hormones and surgery on demand.


In the past, Truscum primarily referred to TiMs who called themselves ‚ÄúWomen Born Transsexual‚Äù or ‚ÄúHarry Benjamin Syndrome Transexuals‚Äù, who claimed to be early transitioners who mostly live stealth. You can‚Äôt really take what they say at face value- a lot of them are liars, too. "
6860,[deleted]
6861,"Exactly. I mean really, do TIMs not worry about personal liability? They can easily cause very expensive damage to a female opponent. I think a lot of transpeople are either very young and do not understand things like ‚Äúhow will I pay for my hormones for life?‚Äù, and ‚Äúhow do I get health insurance?‚Äù, and ‚Äúwho pays for it ($$$) when someone gets hurt?‚Äù Then there‚Äôs you‚Äôre older AGPs who are just too delusional to give a flying fuck and probably try and offload their debts onto society whenever possible"
6862,"Not at all, and more than a few comments are challenging them, they are bad company indeed, or sad company, be glad to be rid of them. "
6863,"Yes. You'll note the mention of ""SWERFs"" in their announcement thread regarding my removal. I've also seen anti-pornography viewpoints removed. 

I would say the thing I noticed most was definitely gender identity related stuff, though, but perhaps that's because it bugged me so much. It's also the only thing I kept any record of."
6864,Here's a quick [overview](https://www.newportacademy.com/resources/treatment/teens-antidepressants-side-effects-risks-holistic-treatment/).  This article is pretty brief and doesn't go into great detail but one significant thing that's missing as well are the serious withdraw symptoms and emphasis on side effects which continue after use. 
6865,"I think a mod is coming over here, looking at our names, and banning us.

Stupid.

It's that against Reddit rules?

"
6866,"If you really don't know where radical feminism stands on the subject, that graduate degree has't taught you much."
6867,"I see, no worries. I've been as transparent as I possibly can about what happened. The only thing I'm ashamed of is that I didn't just leave sooner, and that I ever even bothered to use an alternate account to post news articles and comments that I knew would be controversial. I should've had the courage of my convictions.

I don't think there's any hope for it; the censorship I've observed clearly demonstrates that TwoX is not intended for the perspectives of women if they have the wrong perspective.
"
6868,[removed]
6869,"I did not use the word ""transmen"", please point out where I did. I said ""transgender males"", by which I mean transwomen. ""Transgender male"" or ""trans identified male"" are commonly used expressions in gender critical communities to refer to transwomen, and conversely ""transgender female"" or ""trans identified female"" is used to refer to transmen.

6882,"Rachel Dolezal is TOTALLY DIFFERENT because obviously claiming to be of a different racial ethnicity than what you are clearly identifiable as is RACIST AND CULTURE APPROPRIATING but claiming to be a different sex than what you are clearly identifiable as is *valid* and *not at all* demeaning or appropriating womanhood for one's personal benefit.

And of course if you say otherwise, you are committing *literal violence* you *hateful bigot* and how dare you be such a disgusting TERF, and we will all talk about how much we want to punch you but it's totally not hypocritical for breathlessly decrying violence where none exists while fantasizing about violence, because when you're trans you're super and special and awesome, and the only real women are trans women, because cis women are just TERFy menstruators.

Isn't trans ideology so wonderfully internally consistent?"
6883,Wanting to deal with these exact issues was part of the reason I applied in the first place.

6896,"Frankly I think this is the only way to deal with it. Look at the reaction the rapper Zuby got when he ""identified as a woman"" to do a deadlift (making fun of gender bullshit). It was largely positive.

6899,No worries. Quite simply how I understand what a trans person is hasn‚Äôt changed. A trans person is someone who suffers from gender dysphoria. I believe that‚Äôs a very real thing and I can‚Äôt even imagine how awful it must be to hate the body you can‚Äôt get away from short of drastic measures.

6913,"You'd think, yeah. But the main ""lesbian"" subs on reddit are for lesbian-*identified* people, not homosexual women. The moderators on the biggest lesbian subs (most of whom are transwomen) ban women for being open about being same-*sex* attracted rather than same-*gender* attracted (the latter of which would be a subtype of *bisexuality*).

Specifically, the sub r/actuallesbians is mainly for lesbian-identified males (and their bisexual female partners, who also call themselves ""lesbians"" despite being capable of sexual attraction to both male and female bodies). The sub r/LesbianActually started off when a group of lesbians broke away from the AL sub, mostly because AL turned into pretty much a replica of one of the other countless trans subs on reddit (top posts are frequently things like ""check out my tracheal shave!"") Additionally, AL had a tendency to militantly ban anyone who is homosexual instead of homogenderal (and open about it). So LA existed as an alternative for actual lesbians- for a short time. But then, to my knowledge, one of the mods on LA started dating a transwoman, and then at least one transwoman became a moderator there themselves. And then recently (like in the past 6-12 months) *that* ""lesbian"" sub started becoming much more trans-oriented, to the point where it had straight up dudes posting dick pics and mods deleting any posts on the sub (and banning gay users too) that talked about not liking dick. So then lesbians (homosexual women) made r/truelesbians, and we are occasionally featured on the ""Against Hate Subs"" subreddit because apparently it is hateful for a woman to categorically exclude all males from her body (and for her to refuse to lie about it-- and I did lie, for years, saying I'd sleep with a transwoman when asked in queer circles order to avoid being called a TERF).

So that's basically where we're at now- truelesbians is the sub for same-sex attracted female people, and it is small but has been growing quickly over the past few months. Oh, and it goes without saying that the sub r/lesbians is lesbian porn for men. "

I don't think that's the case. It's because they're the type of person who can badly damage their (the men at the top) reputation by using the transphobia card, even tho they're ftm trans that don't even TRY to pass as a woman.

For many men, unlearning the need to be the center of everything is a challenge. As women, we live being pushed off to the side every day. That‚Äôs why we are the way we are about male posters. It is to serve us as women.

If you are looking at the world your daughters will inherit and feeling angry about what you know they are going to go through, then you have the right mindset. And frankly, having the opportunity to be raised by a single female figurehead without a toxic male parent overriding her decisions may have benefited you in some ways. I‚Äôve noticed that the men I have encountered raised by single mothers with absent fathers tend to have more empathy for women. Just my two cents."

6991,My husband is the one who made me GC. He says he is GC because he loves women. For a long time I would pretend things weren't as bad as he was always ranting to me. Then I peaked and I peaked and I peaked - ha! Now I spread the GC word like a gad damn Jehovah's Witness.

7197,"So this show is being picked up on Twitter and the tweets are just depressing as fuck. A sampling:

""Louis is suggesting that all sex workers are damaged and women can't have unemotional detached sex. We can and we do. Would have been better if he'd balanced it out with sex workers who didn't have sad pasts.""

It also turns out that the woman with autism in the documentary has a carer who wrote a letter complaining to the BBC about the documentary, and she's tweeted it. Apparently she is upset it doesn't show sex work in a positive light!  The carer is also upset because she is a sex worker and they didn't include her story in the show (I suspect this is the real reason for the angry letter.) This carer lady thought she would be in the documentary as well, (but she didn't have a contract) and apparently now she's worried she is ugly and has a 'lack of charisma'.There's clearly some issues here.

The carer is angry that the woman's friends were asked questions about what they thought about her job. I thought prostitution was a-ok? Why would it be inappropriate to ask her friends questions about her escorting, especially when the entire point of the documentary was about sex work? 

Apparently talking about the women's bad pasts was an 'outdated stereotype and furthered that narrative that something bad has happened to sex workers. I don't know what to make of this. Maybe it's a stereotype for a reason? If I'm going to be convinced that sex work is great, I don't really need to see a woman sobbing because she was abused as a child.

Finally, the carer complains she she was outed as a sex worker without her consent, despite...agreeing to be in the show and agreeing to put that information in. 

Oh, and she gloats that Louis sat on a bed covered in dog piss. Charming!"

When I first got into SW in my late teens/early 20‚Äôs I remember my best friend who I would do it with and I felt so ashamed and alone because it was nowhere near as accepted and normalized as it is now. We would constantly question if what we were doing was really okay and worth the money. I remember talking to my TiM friends about my concerns, thinking they could relate as another marginalized group, and they would try to convince me that this was all actually very empowering and that just because I had my doubts about it didn‚Äôt mean all sex workers hated what they do or were damaged. (I too had been sexually assaulted multiple times before becoming a SW) So I just let myself be brainwashed by the libfem SWIW mantra and kept it going for years longer than I should have.

7218,Well done!
7219,"Although I think it is totally true and an important thing to be mindful of in conversations about sex work - that many women involved are traumatized women with low self-esteem - I think that many women become defensive in the face of this accusation and dont want to hear us out because it is also true that many women are not traumatized and simply do it for the money. 

This was my perspective when I was involved in ""sex work"" - that I saw an opportunity to make easy money so I took it. I never once deluded myself into thinking I was doing anything empowering or positive for women, but the way I saw it was that Im going to be exploited either way in society as a woman, so I may as well try to make as much money as possible in the process. I would never do the work though if it wasn't true that it pays so much.. 

..this I think is ultimately  the strongest argument for getting someone to concede this ""work"" degrades women - that we do it because it pays, not that it is empowering OR implicitly degrading. To be a woman in society is already degrading."

7226,"I was recently talking with a millennial woman who wants to go into online video sex. As a qualifier, having lived in Amsterdam, and worked in Harm Reduction with prostitutes I think prostitution and all consensual adult sex work should be legal. But I discouraged her because I consider it a bad self-destructive impulse and I mean why the f did you get a masters degree then? 

Use your brain and protect your spirit! She told me I was 'sex shaming' and a square, a prude and that it was 'empowering'. I have never bought that line of BS and meeting many prostitutes in my prior job never changed that. The way they frame it as 'sex positive' makes it a challenge to make them understand that it's more 'sex positive' to have sex in appropriate circumstances with someone who might actually give two shits about you."
7227,"I haven't watched this yet and I'm not sure if I will. I have mutual friends with a couple of women that were featured in the documentary and they weren't happy with the way they were treated during filming. They wrote about it on their website which you can find here: https://sites.google.com/prod/view/babeworld/archive under ""bbc.pdf"""

7229,[removed]
7230,"I watched this with a friend, and she believes sex work is just work, should be legalised, blah blah. I said at the start of the program ""I bet these women have really sad backgrounds and lead very tough lives."" She scoffed and said ""not all women in sex work are damaged! Some of them love the work!"" By the end of the show she was pretty glum about the huge amount of exploitation and trauma. I was too to be honest - I didn't expect it to be that bad. 

I think here's something that lib fems don't quite get. For them, prostitution is always done by some mythical other woman who 'loves sex' and 'loves to feel empowered'. Who are these women? My friend wouldn't be a prostitute - she was repulsed at the idea. She wouldn't like her kids to be prostitutes. She wouldn't like it if her friends became prostitutes. So who are these magical women who love having sex with five strange men a day? They don't exist. Female support for prostitution comprises of women cheering on the rights of imaginary figures, while balking at the idea of doing this kind of work themselves."
7231,"What's not representative is trotting out privileged, middle class (and usually white) women who do cam shows from the safety of their own homes and saying ""listen to sex workers"" while not listening to the poor women, the trafficked women, the girls who are too young to even be called women, and the abused women, who make up the vast majority of ""sex workers""."
7232,"Yeah I was worried because he did a documentary a few years ago about a brothel in Nevada, and it was presented as very kooky and light hearted. This program was nothing like that."
7233,"Gosh I can't understand why they're acting embarrassed, it's just work right? Also the absolute nerve of the women who want to silence victims of sexual abuse because it doesn't fit their narrative. Unbelievably stupid and rage inducing doesn't even begin to cover it."
7234,">""Louis is suggesting that all sex workers are damaged and women can't have unemotional detached sex. We can and we do. Would have been better if he'd balanced it out with sex workers who didn't have sad pasts.""

It wouldn't surprise me if he had TRIED to find a prostitute who wasn't raped/abused at some point but just couldn't. Even many of the ""Happy Hookers"" and ""Happy Porn Stars"" out there who publicly defend sex work admit to being abused or raped at some point in their lives.

&#x200B;

> It also turns out that the woman with autism in the documentary has a  carer who wrote a letter complaining to the BBC about the documentary,  and she's tweeted it. Apparently she is upset it doesn't show sex work  in a positive light!  The carer is also upset because she is a sex  worker and they didn't include her story in the show (I suspect this is  the real reason for the angry letter.)  

This is VERY concerning! It makes me wonder if the carer coerced and/or groomed the autistic girl in her care into sex work. I didn't see the documentary yet, so I don't know how much mental functioning the girl has. But the fact that she relies on a carer makes me think that she might not have the mental capacity to understand what sex work entails and to properly consent to it.

&#x200B;

At the very least, I hope this documentary and that unhinged letter leads to that poor girl getting a new carer (and the old one getting blacklisted from caring for any other vulnerable person)"
7235,"After reading it I feel really uncomfortable. Carers are meant to be helpful, friendly sure. But to become best friends with someone in a situation where there is clearly a power dynamic and a reliance of the one girl on the other, and then the carer ‚Äúintroduces her‚Äù to escorting... 

And then the girl says she was fine with the edit until her carer told her otherwise. Oof."
7236,">...furthered that narrative that something bad has happened to sex workers.

I hate this line of attack. It's so dishonest. It assumes the ""narrative"" to be false as a foregone conclusion without actually presenting any arguments as to why it's false. You could say that about absolutely anything, the phrase is so devoid of meaning.

As in ""...furthered the narrative that seat belts save lives"" or ""...furthered the narrative that the moon is not made of cheese"", or ""...furthered the narrative that dogs make great pets"". 

So it ""furthers the narrative"". I don't give a damn if someone thinks it furthers a narrative. Is the claim correct or not? If there are arguments against the claim, then trot them out. Just whinging about a ""narrative"" being ""furthered"" is meaningless."
7237,Having unemotional detached sex outside of 'sex work' is not even comparable to the exploitative shit in 'sex work'

7247,"I wonder if this is where the whole ""sex work is empowering"" thing really came from. Obviously it's a libfem mantra pushed by men, but I do wonder if all of these women who push it consider it ""empowering"" because they think they're getting ahead of inevitable abuse. Like in a 'men are going to objectify me whether I'm an underwear model or a brain surgeon, so why not turn a profit from it?' kinda way. I know I felt that way in my young years."

The woman who was abused is on twitter denying it has anything to do with getting into sex work (despite saying she‚Äôs hyper sexual due to the abuse, does it to work through trauma etc). She is dismayed that she has not managed to present sex work as empowering and fantastic, and that she‚Äôs given a stereotypical view. 

I also think ultimately that every woman is affected and traumatised by patriarchy. We grow up in a world determined to see us as sex objects and not human. I can really appreciate this attitude of ‚Äúfuck it , If you‚Äôre going to abuse me I‚Äôm going to make money‚Äù."

I understand she wants to present a narrative that she's empowered, and it's all fantastic, but people have eyes and can read between the lines. She is (according to her) a very disabled woman who needs full time care. She cannot live independently. She was horribly abused as a child and seems to be working through her trauma through sex. She is still actively upset by it. I mean, it's not great right? It's sad. There's a real worry that men are further abusing and exploiting someone who appears to be quite vulnerable."

There's a subset of sex workers in my city who are ""empowered"" women making a ""choice"" and they are mostly young and living a seemingly jetset lifestyle. They do it to fund this lifestyle of travel, designer goods and basically and ironically, to live the good life.

But it's damaging. And not worth it. And they don't actually NEED all that money, they just think they do to live this capitalist, materialist life ideal that's been foisted on us all by the powers that be.

""Of course, but she'll work a lot. And if she didn't do it someone else would."" So chilling. The guy who ran those two brothels was notorious for controlling what could come out of it, but he gave documentarians (and HBO, that program they put out was totally NOT a documentary) access that no one else did.

It sure sounds like she's being, to some extent, pimped out since her friend is involved in her bookings (and in the doc there's a scene where the friend basically has to remind her to check the very fake sounding reviews for a client she's about to see, because she didn't think of it and appears to have a dulled concern for her own safety)."

Men have relatively extreme sex drives and an urge to act on it. Women have the thing men want between their legs. Some of them are willing to accept cash or credit card for it.

The idea that it is somehow empowering for the woman to degrade herself into a literal sex object for cash is total crock and always has been.

I know my situation is the exception and not the rule. Hell I'd given up on dating and was content by myself before I met this guy because most guys are assholes who don't see women as full human beings and I was tired of dealing with their shit.

In fact I think the experience of being a woman in society is so traumatizing partially because the reality of our own trauma is hidden from us in such a way where we barely even get to see its existence validated by others at all. Many women do not yet even realize the crushing conditions we exist under.

I think this is it. Sex work is a HUGE umbrella term that seeks to conflate a girl selling lewd cosplay pictures so she can buy designer handbags to impoverished prostitutes who have to service five men a day just to survive. 

&#x200B;

They've also deluded themselves into believing that legalization will magically bring the trafficked street-walkers ""out of the shadows"" since they'll now have legal brothels where they can work instead of depending on street pimps.

i have another former friend who is mid 30's and is now doing sex work. she is extremely fit and works as a dominatrix, but also has sex with her clients. before she got into this work, she was working retail and struggling month to month. we live in an extremely expensive and materialistic city where everyone is flashing their cars and clothes and fancy holidays. her instagram is also full of the same stuff now.

my point is these were pretty normal women who i doubt would feel the need to make ""so much money"" if we didn't live in such a fucked up society that shovels materialism down our throats every which way we turn. my friend in particular, if she lived somewhere that you could get by on a normal wage and didn't have people all around her living these extreme lifestyles with cars and clothes out of reach to anyone on a normal wage, i doubt she'd decide to sell herself to ""achieve"" that level of ""success"" and the so-called ""good life""...

It's fucking insane."
7342,">I don‚Äôt think men have extreme sex drives, their sex drives are normal. I have the sex drive of most men.

I'm not sure how you've managed to measure your libido against most men, but you can find a mountain of peer reviewed studies that demonstrate a crystal clear and very large disparity in libido on average. The difference depends on the metric, but it is there. And not individual by individual, but as a group (hence plural men).

Any disparity at all will drive supply and demand. That's not empowerment.

>What‚Äôs not normal is their lack of empathy and ethics.

This one is a strange point to make as it contradicts what 'normal' means (since the assertion is about half the population) and is widely seen among many other polygamous social/herding species (of which humans are one, or were in the not too distant past). I think many sociologists, biologists, and anthropologists have suggested that, as far as evolution is concerned, that it makes sense to be that way. But I digress.

I totally agree that sex for women is an emotional and empathetic gesture and for men it is not.

>And ‚Äúthere are some that cross over into a relationship‚Äù what the fuck are you talking about? Pretty Woman is not a documentary.

I'm talking beyond Pretty Woman and addressing the alternative view - that sex work should be respectable, empowering, or about more than the men's perspective of what sex is about. I acknowledge that some women in the industry play roles more than the asserted 'masturbatory aid', but that this is extremely rare. In the industry altogether, the alternate scenario is what is common and is why sex work really isn't empowering at all."

They may have appeared normal to you, a relative outsider. But I guarantee you that, if they have a close loving family, those people would tell you that these women had struggled with learning, working, emotional regulation, eating disorders and/or drugs for years. 

Women who have ""other options,"" don't become or stay sex workers just because they like material things. The material things may be something they're attached to, but always as a distraction for some underlying problem. 

One of my (redacted) has been a sugar baby, yacht girl and ""high end"" escort. She's definitely not living on the streets. And when she was younger she definitely had a very Instagramable life. Her friends think she's the life of the party.

But her parents would tell you that she has faced a lifelong struggle with eating and personality disorders. That she's tried and failed to pursue degrees or hold down a normal job. That she was devastated every time she lost a normal job. (ETA: Even the service industry jobs that she might have told her friends didn't pay enough.) That she's deeply ashamed of those losses, to the point that she can't even reflect on them. 

I guarantee you, your friends would not just be living a ""normal lifestyle"" if they weren't surrounded by materialism. The materialism is just the filter for the way they express whatever overarching issues have affected them since childhood. Which you don't know about because they're experts at dissimulating. 

There are scores and scores of girls who are affected by mental health and developmental issues that get passed through the educational system because they are people pleasers and because, in some affluent schools, you just don't fail anyone. Some of them even manage to make it through college by choosing a ""filler major"" and just retaking hard classes till they get a negligent professor. 

But eventually their inability to perform difficult cognitive tasks on a daily basis, consistently, catches up to them. These are the women who become lifelong sex workers even though they come from an affluent background. 

Sex work takes advantage of the impoverished, for sure. But it also takes advantage of women who are troubled with psychiatric and developmental issues."
7346,"I had a friend who did it for about a year and while she hated it, she said it was hard to give up the money. Compared with the kind of work she could get that wasn't sex work, she was earning really good money. But it screwed her up quite a bit I think."

7348,"Yes, this is one of the things about prostitution that just makes me wretch and the johns just don‚Äôt care. Polyamorous people don‚Äôt really seem to care either in my experience, but at least everyone is somewhat more on board there. People who cheat with prostitutes and people who cheat and do anal and IV are prob the worst. When I was trafficked it‚Äôs not like anybody started crying over how their wife was gonna be hurt by it. Raping teenagers makes for a great husband. I had chlamydia the entire time too.

I saw someone make a comment on an unrelated post about women‚Äôs sexuality. They mentioned how women get called needy for wanting to cuddle and they argued that the only reason women are needier is because they‚Äôre sexually unsatisfied because no one tries to make us cum üòÇ
So basically, we like to cuddle more because we have high sex drives that are unresolved.

7350,"Testosterone mght be the main hormone for sex drive in men but it is not so for women, our sex drive is much more influenced by estrogen and progesterone, thus the fact that men have higher testosterone cannot be used as an explanation or proof.

I disagree with the overall conclusion that men have much higher lbidos than women too, between birth control, the danger of violence of pregnancy for women and the shaming of women regarding their sexual desires and needs that has lasted for centuries I'd say it's a miracle women aren't worse when it comes to sex."

Her mother pushed her into getting head to toe surgeries to look perfect and while I don't know if she pushed into prostitution, she certainly didn't disapprove (""my mum says other girls do it for free every Friday night!""). 

This woman's brothers have literally have MBAs from very prestigious schools and have graced the business pages of newspapers. I have the impression her brothers were pushed to achieve academically and in business and it was her job to just be pretty. She's really suffered in her quest to look perfect. In the time I knew her, she had extreme lipo that her mother pushed her into and almost died (not exaggerating one bit) , her recovery was so protracted due to complications.

As I said, the reason we are no longer friends I believe is because she revealed herself to me as a sex worker. But we were very close and she hid that she was a sex worker very well."

OK, I am not making multiple 6 figures, but I have a good salary, beautiful place to live and I have no problem at all paying for my lifestyle out of that. I think our mutual friend thought it would appeal to me not to go to work? Getting gifts from rich men like the stories she was telling me about? Idk. But its not for me.

We all fell out after that, I think because our mutual friend revealed herself as a sex worker to me. Its really odd because her family is quite wealthy, thats where I thought her money and lifestyle was coming from.

I was going to say maybe it had to do with the cost barrier to entry for personal training. It requires certification and that usually costs around $600 in the U.S. But if they're wealthy, it's probably more to do with the pay. New personal trainers working at a gym make minimum wage or a little over. The pay is not a driver to join the fitness industry."

Unless they've changed things in the 15 years since I got my first cert, you can get an ultra basic weekend certification and work in a gym, it's not that expensive. I think at 24 Hour Fitness, you could even come in with no certs and just do their proprietary 3 day ""certification"" and take on clients if you could get them. I also worked at Equinox and Equinox will educate you themselves. 

I mean, at the end of the day, she didn't do that. She made her choices. I shared her story because I really feel that she's someone I personally know who is a victim of materialism and our grotesque capitalist society. I wonder if she happy with her choices. She hasn't chosen this career path for survival. She's done it to live a luxury lifestyle. And I think, at least in my city, that's the motivation for a lot of women choosing sex work."

They've changed things. It might also vary by area. Where I'm at, any decent gym is going to require you are already certified by ACE, NASM, or similar, before they hire you. Those programs are several hundred dollars. And, like I said, the starting pay isn't much above minimum wage. $14 or $15 an hour.

Personal trainers *can* make more, for sure. But that would be an established trainer with a solid client base who's working for themselves and not a gym. At the start, it does not pay much. It's a line of work you join out of passion, not a need for money."
7367,"As I said ""not the main hormone"" which doesn't mean it has no effect, much like testosterone seems to be the main hormone affecting sexual drive in men and yet estrogen, progesterone, and the relation between them still has an effect on male sex drive.


Here are some of the symptoms men go through with low estradiol:


Fatigue along the lines of sleepiness

Hypersomnia (sleeping too much and too often)

Strong erections but limited sensitivity

 **Loss of erections**

Osteoporosis and osteopenia

Joint pain, clicking or popping joints

Eye fatigue (eyes seem more tired despite adequate sleep, dark circles)

 **Loss of libido**

Anxiety, depression, irritability


Yup, turns out a lot of things we thought were just from low T in males are actually also from low E.

And from wikipedia about the impact of T on females:

>""Research suggests **androgens such as testosterone, are not sufficient by themselves to prompt sexual motivation in females.** In particular, studies with rhesus macaques have observed testosterone was not significantly associated with variations in level of sexual motivation in females.¬†However, some research with nonhuman primates suggests a role for androgens in female sexual reproduction behaviour. Adrenalectomized female rhesus monkeys displayed diminished female sexual receptivity. Later studies revealed this diminished sexual receptivity was specific to the elimination of androgens that **can be converted to estrogen.**"""

I wish that more people understood this. I say this in the nicest way possible but not every conversation needs to be inclusive or intersectional, and that's okay. It's alright for people in a certain in-group be allowed to surround themselves by others in the group for support. It's not a slight and not all indicative of who you are as a person if someone just wants support from others going through the same thing. If a person has cancer, they don't go to AA meetings and demand to be heard despite not being an alcoholic."
7371,"Thank you for this analogy, I hadn't think of it that way.

I have a similar feeling, as I cannot have biological children. When I hear a statement such as ""women can be pregnant, women usually take contraception, women can breast feed, women have their period each month or so..."" or anything related to pregnancy, I do not feel excluded. I do not need to say ""excuse-me, are you saying I am not a woman?"".

I am looking forward to adopt too, and your post made my day. "

7377,Beautiful 
7378,">  I am not now and never will be the biological mother of my children.


One of my earliest ‚Äúpeak trans‚Äù moments was reading a post by a TiM about how offensive it is to say he is not a biological woman because of...reasons. "
7379,"Yes yes yes to everything you said.  

Its similar for parents of disabled or severely ill children.  One of my kids had a very severe medical condition.  He wasnt always able to do what other kids were.  We spent months living in a hospital.  That doesnt mean people should tailor discussions about their children around what reality is for my child.  Other moms I know would feel guilty when talking about the routine aggravation in their kids lives (someone is being mean to them at school, etc) and then they would remember the hardships my child was facing.  I'd always tell them to please continue, the world doesnt revolve around me or my kid, whatever is going on in their life is important too.

You sound like a great mom, keep up the good work!"
7380,"I don't have kids at all. There are probably more of us than of you awesome adoptive parents, and yet I accept that most women have children and that parenting, school stuff, etc. are common topics of conversation online and in person. 

Most of the time I'm interested in the subject when it comes up--I'm an aunt and a taxpayer, these are people I know and I am just generally interested in their experiences--but if it does make my eyes glaze over, I find a way to politely drift away from the conversation. In fact, I feel bad about it when people apologize to me about ""rambling on"" (their words, not mine) about child-related stuff. I absolutely never demand that they make the conversation all about me and my interests.  In fact, that would make me feel extremely uncomfortable.

Oh, yeah, and I would never presume to know more about childrearing than seasoned parents (or new ones, for that matter).

I think what you're describing above is typically  a *male* behavior. (Yes, some women, blah blah, but MOST MEN.) Not being the center of attention in any women's conversation or forum is utterly intolerable to them.  I used to be active in the comments of *Salon's* now-defunct column ""Broadsheet,"" and the first or second comment would always be ""What about the men?"" or ""Not all men!"" or the totally, absurdly irrelevant ""We need to legalize marijuana!"" (always posted by a man--because his subject matter, however unrelated to the topic at hand, should ALWAYS take precedence over whatever trivial things women are talking about, like reproductive rights or equal pay or domestic violence). 

So it wouldn't surprise me at all if being the center of female attention was a primary, if unacknowledged or even unrecognized, factor in a lot of decisions to transition, now that women are bending over backwards to provide it.  In forums like the one I describe, women would at first try to placate and engage with male intruders, and then they'd start to call them out or just ignore them, and eventually such comments would just be considered harassment or trolling and be removed altogether. We need to do this more often and in larger numbers, and when it occurs in real life, we need to smile politely, nod, and bring the conversation back on track. It takes courage, and the initial response will be ugly and unpleasant, but ultimately I think this approach will be effective."
7381,"Kind of off-topic, but could you (or someone else involved in adoption) explain what will happen to your children‚Äôs birth certificates after they are legally adopted? 


I keep hearing about trans people having their birth certificates ammended to reflect their gender identity, and to my knowledge adoptees are the only other group of people who regularly have amended birth certificates (aside from people with errors/typos on their original birth certificate). "
7382,"I have a daughter and from the beginning of my pregnancy to now, she is in elementary school, i have a hard time accepting the mother role. Moms in general are often looked down at and shamed for soo much, people always accuse you of doing something wrong, ... but I can imagine that as an adoptive parent it's even worse because people treat you different. I just wish the mother role, biological or not, would be as honoured in society as it deserves for raising new people and making them into (hopefully) good adults "
7383,"Thank you for sharing. As an adoptee, it makes my heart soar to hear of happy parents and kids. Adoptive parents are an absolute treasure!

 It doesn't matter who my bio parents are, parents are the people who raise you. There's no replacing that.

It does irk me that my birth certificate has my parents (as opposed to bio parents) name on it, purely because I thought they were meant to be historical as opposed to symbolic/ changeable records. I do understand why adoptive parents might want their names on instead, however. Either way, it hasn't caused any problems for me, I'm just grateful to be with my family!"
7384,"I love this. I often think of adoption as a really great analogy for transgenderism. 

The current ideology of Self ID is the equivalent of part time fucking babysitters demanding full parental rights, unrestricted access to nursery schools, and screaming and crying if people don‚Äôt pretend to believe they gave birth to the kids they babysit once a fortnight."

7393,"Thank you for providing that wonderful analogy from your personal experience. Many of us join (or, are invited in join) existing groups with established identities, customs, and concerns, and, are respectful of them. Not so, transgender activists. Not only do they insist on joining club ""Woman, "" but as soon as they gain entry (whether by invitation, chance, manipulation, harassment, violence, or the law), they start upending established definitions, customs, and concerns to better reinforce their fragile and fictitious female identities. 

And, so, ""Women's"" groups with TIM members may no longer be able to discuss menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, lactation,  and menopause.  And, in some instances, these same groups may not even be able to bring children to their social gatherings...because, as with all things related to female biology, children remind some TIMs of their inadequacy."

Sadly, plenty of biological parents, for a range of reasons that include among others systemic sexism, racism, and classism, are developmentally impaired and their kids end up with lifelong neurological wiring that leaves them profoundly insecure, depressed, and vulnerable to predators. Nothing about ""biological"" parenting that guarantees someone can raise a mentally adaptive, loving, generous human being. Yes, carrying them for nine months, labor, and breast-feeding can be wonderful (and agonizing) bonding experiences, but that doesn't preclude parental narcissism. "

7408,"I‚Äôm adopted my brother was not, so my mum did have the ability to compare how she felt as a mother to both a biological and non biological child, if anything me being adopted prob made her more fiercely protective of me, she  brought us both up brilliantly imo and was very big on fairness to us both.
As a side note , I was brought up always knowing I was adopted, definitely the best route not pretending I was anything other than who I was, because of my interest in the subject I have known of other people finding out they are adopted in adulthood or later teenage years and it completely unraveling their understanding of themselves, pulling the rug out from under them so to speak. I think telling children they can be the opposite sex , IMO they can‚Äôt  could be a comparable complicite lie  that can only do untold damage in their future."

How can someone know this (my adoptive mother feels are the same as biological mother feels) anymore than a non-female can know what it feels like to be a biological female? Isn't that what is so worked against here? ""You've never been biologically female, therefore you don't know what it feels like."" You've never been a biological mother, so how can you know you experience the same things? You may love your children with ferocity, but you cannot really say it is ""the same ferocity"" any more than than a trans person can say they have ""the same"" feelings as something they've never been...

7413,"People are very lonely (in the U.S. but maybe this applies to the greater West), I think, and this leads them to seek to find their place everywhere and in everything because it is not in their homes or even their own bodies at this point. The demographics (longitudinal and well-supported) are not on hand at this moment, but Americans are not having as much sex with each, they don't date each other as much or for as long, they don't marry each other as much, they don't have babies with each other, they don't want babies with each other as much, and they mostly live alone. The majority of Americans rely on technology, otherwise ""the screen.""


Americans are losing their kinship and this seems to push them toward transitory and disparate discursive communities where they can place their identities and affiliation. Actually, Americans brand themselves with goofy monikers in order to be apart of various identities and affiliations because that's how desperate they are to expend affection. Unfortunately, kinship communities--those born of sharing homesteads, rituals, neighborhoods, food, stories, geographic spaces, histories, families (this includes adopters and adoptees), and even common language (think of all the new neologisms becoming legal writ that bring us to this forum)--are intrinsically bound in ways that the State and technology cannot unravel, sublimate or substitute. Americans spend the vast majority of their time staring at screens (me too!). I hate to say it, but humans are animals and they kinda function best when they interface with each other face-to-face, live in collectives stably, and are allowed to freely associate with each other as autonomous bodies. Actually this is the only function the State and technology ought to be focused on. Instead, the Internet has killed American sociality, and with that, our means of kinship, and therefore stable identity and belonging. Best example of this is the scourge of online dating, and social media is another potent example.


Kinship sociality almost kinda seems to be dying in the U.S. only to be replaced with consumerist/brand-driven discursive communities. Discursive communities require no bodies though, you would just need to speak the magic words to be granted entry. And as long as your magic words don't compromise the discursive communities ""community guidelines"", you're in. If you don't use that communities approved language, you'd like be ejected at a moment's notice, much unlike how kinship sociality works.


I haven't been to the U.S. in a while, but the reports of people in my cohort who I try to keep in touch with are weird to say the least. Everyon'e lonely. No one married. No one's having kids. They all work too much to do anything. And they're stressed out.

Sometimes listening to them chat, or even just seeing them walking around being so visibly pregnant, is upsetting to me.

And yet, it would never occur to me to tell them that they need to shut up and stop talking about their pregnancies because it bothers me.  At the worst I might ask someone not to talk about pregnancy *with me*, individually, but even that would feel harsh."

They aren't going to be debated or empathized into better behavior,  and the myth that they will be does nothing but distract us from taking up methods that have a shot at being effective."
7439,"Absolutely. And don‚Äôt get me started on late-transitioning transwomen with older children who suddenly want to be known as their child‚Äôs mother. Christ, what an insult to the child‚Äôs actual mother. 

Tbh I was surprised to learn that adoptive parents in some places can have their child‚Äôs birth certificate changed. In Britain you get a separate adoption certificate but the birth certificate stays the same. "
7440,"Would you also agree that most European societies and their former colonies have also decided that the term ""woman"" can identify to people who were not initially socialized as girls?"
7441,"I've also seen others say there is a difference. Without having the experience yourself, it seems odd to claim to know which side you lie on... and is just very reminiscent in a somewhat amusing way of claiming to feel the same as something you've never been, as a trans person does. A trans woman asking a biological woman how it feels isn't the same as being a woman and feeling it, you know? That seems accepted in this sub. 

Minor comment on the rest of your post. Don't take it too strongly or to mean I am suggesting you don't love your kids fiercely. "
7442,[removed]
7443,Sorry . . . didn't mean to sound like I was picking your comment apart there. I completely agree.
7444,"There was a case in the states I think Arizona where they wanted the two male (one bio, one adoptive) parents on the birth cert, judge said no.  Honestly how could you deny your child their objective biological identity, pretend they have no mother???"
7445,"Different governments handle it differently.  I‚Äôm in the US, and in my state adopted children are given an amended birth certificate whether they are infants or older children.  It ends up leading to a lot of confusion in certain instances.  My husband was adopted at 15 out of foster care by a single father.  He has no mother listed on his birth certificate."

7454,Good lord the mods do a good job. 
7455,No. We don't need men.
7456,"i‚Äôm single at the moment but this is truly one of my worst fears. 15 years. i‚Äôm speechless. 

i am terribly sorry for your situation but i hope you know you are making the right decision. here‚Äôs to the next 15 years living your truth."
7457,"This is extremely tough. Please don‚Äôt feel bad for leaving now. Why prolong the inevitable? Be fair to yourself too. Your sanity and well being matters too. This is her journey now, not yours. It‚Äôs ok to go on your own path. If you were my friend I‚Äôd be supportive and relieved you have decided to leave now rather than later. Virtual hug ü§ó"
7458,"I wish I had some decent words of support. I know it is almost all female partners of AGP men, but I wonder if you might still find some kindred spirits in the Trans Widow threads at MumsNet. They will also give sage advice on how to help your children navigate what I‚Äôm sure will also be incredibly hard for them."
7459,"Gosh, I'm so sorry. I've a good friend who split up with her wife in similar circumstances. Very sad."
7460,"I'm so sorry :( You aren't obligated to deal with this life choice from a partner, no more than if they wanted to drop thousands of dollars on clothes or cosmetic surgery. It always hurts to lose someone you care about, but if the alternative is watching them destroy the person you fell in love with... I couldn't stay either. I hope you can find a supportive friend, family member, or counselor."
7461,I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Don‚Äôt let others make you feel bad for making the best choice for yourself and your sanity.
7462,"Wow, 15 years! I'm so sorry, such a great loss. I hope that your children are able to understand and get through the separation  unscathed, I think you are doing the right thing. You cant live a lie and deny your own sexuality and happiness for someone else"
7463,"I just wanted to comment to say I‚Äôm sorry. 15 years and two kids are a lot to share with someone only to have them throw it away. I understand that some feel like they need to express their true selves in this way, but if she‚Äôs still attracted to you and wants to be with women... why do this now ? 

I dunno. I guess, having been with my husband for 15 years and having two kids myself, I can‚Äôt imagine him coming out wanting to be a lesbian. Like why do that if you want to stay with your partner? 

My ignorance is probably showing, just know that I don‚Äôt judge you and that it would be insurmountable for many people"
7464,That was difficult to read. I'm sorry that this happened to you. Fifteen years is a freaking long time and if it happened to me it would feel like the biggest betrayal. Screw those who judge you for leaving; you didn't sign up for this at the beginning. Take care.
7465,"Five years ago, she would‚Äôve held your hand looked you in the eyes and held you in your sadness that you feel right now. Somewhere along the line, this woman that you love leaned in to the hope that pretending to be a man might alleviate the troubles that have been brewing in her, the troubles that just being a woman represents. She wandered away. It‚Äôs hard not to be angry, and sad, and any of the other emotions that you feel. Whether transition a career change or any of the other many life transitions, relationships end because someone couldn‚Äôt help but wander off. I‚Äôm so very sorry. I‚Äôve noticed that Young women who transition in their youth tend to be more of the detransitioners, but older lesbians? They lean into it on the cusp of menopause."
7466,"That's horrible, I'm so sorry :("
7467,"Wow, it's been 15 years for my girlfriend and I as well and I can't even begin to imagine what it would feel like if she dropped such a bomb. And we are not married and don't have kids!

I'm so sorry for you, although be assured that you made the right decision. I really hope that you'll be able to deal with all of this (your children too) and find support IRL."
7468,"I'm so sorry this toxic ideology has taken a hold of the person you love, it sounds like the two of you were happy and had a pretty good life before she started having these thoughts. The people who would judge you for leaving her are few and far between, you didn't sign up to be in a 'straight"" relationship, let alone whatever behavioural changes she might have once she starts taking testosterone, or the burden of having to watch someone go through this self destructive behaviour and having to hold their hand through it. Most people would leave as well, and good on your for knowing so clearly that it's the right thing to do.

Just curious since you mentioned this train on thought was rapidly onset for her, do you think it has anything to do with spaces she frequents or her friends etc? From seeing people mention here how in small school they have 10 ""transboys"" but 0 lesbians it seems transgenderism is mostly socially contagious nowadays rather than some natural impulse.

Either way, wishing you and your kinds strength to deal with this situation and hoping against all odds that your wife realises doing this would be a huge detriment to her own life, as well as her family's."
7469,"Im so sorry for all the pain you are experiencing. Breaking up with someone is losing a part of yourself. It honestly is. Our loved ones act as a sort of secondary memory for us and when you lose that it's heart crushing. When that's gone, part of you...part of the story is gone. *hugs*

The best thing you could do is devote more time to yourself and strengthening your female friendships. If you dont have many of those, now is the time to make some. It's important not to get lost in one's self and your misery. (It's perfectly fine to be miserable and devastated, but you just cant get swept away and drown) The very things we DONT want to do are often the things that actually help us. Any hobbies youve been wanting to start up? Any neglected goals? Mountains to climb? Books to devour? Business ideas to start? Being busy until it's a little less raw and easier to process helps. 
I really hope it the next few months are especially kind to you."
7470,"Maybe random, but I hear that one of the stated reasons FtM stop HRT is because male pattern baldness sets in. It's as if their image of what it means to be a man didn't have that in the picture anywhere. 

I'd probably mention that to her, since this doesn't appear to be something she thinks she just is so much as a thing she has decided she wants. 

My heart goes out to you. Best of luck in this shitty situation."
7471,"Wow, that is a long time to be in a relationship and bare your soul to someone else. I‚Äôm so sorry that it has come to this for you, but you sound like someone that is logical and understanding and knows what‚Äôs best for the both of you. 

Holding onto your wife if she isn‚Äôt your wife anymore would just cause animosity and rather than end on any sour, unfriendly terms, it will be easier and more kind to end on friendly terms for the both of you and your children. You are so strong!! and in no way are you a bad person for not wanting to stay with her whilst she transitions.

Everyone makes their choices in life to be happy, but if it wouldn‚Äôt make you happy as well, why should you stay? Especially if it starts to go against your fundamental beliefs. Just stay strong and know you‚Äôre doing what‚Äôs best for you and your children and with the love you have for her, you can still support her if that‚Äôs your wish but just as she is being, you‚Äôre allowed to be selfish too. protect yourself. you‚Äôre amazing and you will be ok."
7472,"I tried to make it work after someone came out as trans, nope, it's impossible. It's right to end it in the beginning because the alternative is ending it way more traumatized after months or years of nightmares, cognitive dissonance and stress. It sucks but it was the best you could do."
7473,"In a decent society this would be treated as a mental health emergency and she would get the help she needs, but it won't"
7474,"One of the bravest and hardest things you can do in this life is stand up for yourself. It‚Äôs awful that a great decade long relationship has to end like this but you need someone who respects women enough to know that we‚Äôre not an identity you can jump in and out of. 

You don‚Äôt need to tell anyone the reason for your split because really it‚Äôs just between you and your partner.

The way I see it is that this gender ideology is some fanatic new religion, if my partner signed up to it I‚Äôd leave because I don‚Äôt want this craziness in my personal life. The way the followers of this view women makes me uncomfortable and I couldn‚Äôt live with one, and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want to raise children with one."
7475,"Let‚Äôs get some perspective here. It‚Äôs not as if your partner changed from chunky to creamy peanut butter or even changed political party affiliations. I know couples who are opposites in a lot of ways but have been together for years. I know a Christian married to a Jew and a liberal married to a conservative. As a straight female, I am attracted to men. If my husband decided to transition to a female, it would be a dealbreaker for me. As a lesbian you are attracted to females. It‚Äôs what led you to this person to begin with. If my husband had a horrible accident and lost body parts or became disfigured beyond recognition, I‚Äôd still love him because he‚Äôd be the same person inside. But this isn‚Äôt about physical appearance. Your wife is trying to fundamentally change who she is. She is trying to rid herself of the very person you fell in love with. And (I‚Äôm assuming) is willing to put your relationship aside to do it. You aren‚Äôt the person leaving the relationship. She already has. Get some support from people who‚Äôve been there and heal. When you‚Äôre not vulnerable, find someone who cares about you and cares enough about themselves to be the person you love. I hope this helps."
7476,"I‚Äôm so sorry, OP.  I can‚Äôt even imagine.  I‚Äôve already told my husband that if he ever wants to transition, we‚Äôre done.  I‚Äôm not putting up with that bull****, and neither should you."
7477,"I can only imagine the shock you must be in...

I think you're doing the right thing in leaving. I understand your fear of being judged by others for not staying through transition, but let's be real - do you think most others would try to stay? Even if they did, do you think they wouldn't be miserable? I've known women who have stayed through their partner's transitions but in each case they were putting off the inevitable and seemed to suffer even more for all of their trouble.

Perhaps this won't be of any comfort to you but personally, I feel that transitioning is an extraordinarily selfish thing to want to do for someone who is at the point in their life where they have kids, especially kids old enough to remember the experience vividly. So traumatic. 

I hope that you are able to continue to see your counsellor by yourself, as having someone who is non-judgemental who has a good handle on the situation to talk to while you're separating might make all the difference."
7478,"I wouldn't be surprised if she gets over it eventually and wishes she never told you that. 

I know this is little consolation, but the funny part is that even the libfems can't argue with you on this one. You are a lesbian, so why would you want to be married to a man?"
7479,"I'm so sorry. Don't be afraid, the people who will judge are the people you don't want in your life. The people who genuinely love you will remain. Take care of yourself and your children."
7480,This may seem tasteless but due to th fact that men are more socially accepted than women I always feel like when a woman says she identifies as a man she is saying she is better than me or thinks she is better than me or other women.
7481,"I am so sorry this happened, it makes me so sorry to see how many women we are losing to the trans movement. I wish you well and just remember that heartbreak is temporary, soon it will pass. I am sure things will get better for you, wish you the best and you should know we are looking out for you! Let us know how you‚Äôre doing"
7482,I really encourage you to ask for one last shot in counseling. Arm yourself with gender critical talking points and ask her why she thinks she‚Äôs a man and be ready to compassionately rebuke those points. Just about every argument to transition outside of ‚ÄúI want a penis and will die without one‚Äù is gender stereotype brainwashing BS (even the one I noted was nonsense). She‚Äôs gonna have a hard life and lose her family if she chooses to go through this. Find a gender critical therapist but also be ready to support and validate her perspective.
7483,"I admire your conviction and standing up for yourself. In your situation I wouldn't be able to stay either. I'm sorry things turned out like this for you, but you will have opportunities to create happiness again."
7484,"You're a lesbian. 

By leaving her, you're validating her new... whatever. 

Don't be sorry."
7485,"Your wife is suffering a mental health crisis.  She is using trans‚Äôing herself as a coping mechanism.  

If she were a drug addict, or alcoholic, or even a gambler destroying your finances... you would have to leave or be destroyed with her.  

You can‚Äôt save her.  She has to want to save herself first.  

Do what you have to do to protect your kids.  

I‚Äôm sorry you have to go thru this."
7486,"I'm sure you've talked about this before with her but maybe ask her why she's suddenly deciding she's a man and pointing out the illogical nature of her arguments? Would she let you explain that being gender non conforming isn't invalidating your womanhood? That she's still the same woman no matter what she dresses or acts like? Has she gotten a gender dysphoria diagnosis?

I'm so sorry you're going through this, my best hope is that she snaps out of this somehow and figures out why she's suddenly rejecting being a woman. If she doesn't I wish you and your kids the best <3. No one is obligated to stay with a partner and no lesbian is obligated to be with a man or someone convinced they are one. If she can't listen to reason then it's important to get out while you can and explain things to your kids to protect them from this ideology. Your life can matter for yourself and it isn't selfish to care for yourself and your happiness"
7487,My worst nightmare and I am definitely 100% on your side but I cannot imagine. We‚Äôve done the hypothetical situation with one another and we both agreed we would walk away. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss
7488,"I usually wouldn‚Äôt say this but since you still love eachother and have kids, I want to ask, have you tried to educate her about gender critical ideas? Also, have you tried to expose her to the detrans community? It would be so good if you can find a gender critical therapist (psychoanalysts tend to be gender critical) and if she can tackle her body and gender dysmorphia first before doing any couples therapy. I think it‚Äôs worth a fight. Don‚Äôt give up on her."
7489,"Do FTM realize that there is no surgery or method anywhere near successful for giving them a functional penis? You know, the thing that our culture uses to define a man as a man?"
7490,"I am sorry for your shock and sadness and the end of your marriage.  No sensible, sane person would judge you harshly for not staying.  You do not subscribe to the cult of gender ideology and as far as you knew, you did not marry a person who believes in the fallacy of changing sex.  If your wife suddenly became a JW or a Moonie and insisted that you share their beliefs and practices, you would never put up with that.  

I hope this experience doesn't make you lose trust in people.  I had a sudden and really unexpected end to my relationship and it fucked me up for years.  Please do not waste time wondering if it will happen again.  When you are ready, trust again without reservation; don't let this experience mark you.  You did nothing wrong."
7491,I'm sorry for your loss.
7492,"this is one of the scariest things, i hope you will get through it and continue to live a happy life. 15 years and two children... wow. *sending hugs*"
7493,"I'm so sorry :/ Out of curiosity what did she ask for or demand from you in accommodating her transition?  General curiosity to better understand the implications, not questioning your choice."
7494,I'm so sorry OP. That sounds devastating. I hope at least you can break up amicably after such a long relationship - and that hopefully if she has doubts you will be a voice of reason in her life. But this is such an irresponsible thing to do not only if one is married but especially if one has children. Tearing apart one's family for a vanity project/delusion like this is incredibly hurtful and you have every right to want to leave. I wish all the best to you.
7495,"I know someone who went through a similar thing. Before gay marriage was legal. She stayed with ""him"" and after legal transition they got married. TG had that ability long before gays. It did not last. Eventually she had an affair with a woman and a few years after that they got divorced. Of cpurse this occured before the trans cult had fully taken over so most people did not blame her. You are doing what is best for you. I do not blame you one bit. You would have to go along with ""his"" fiction sexually which would ultimately be impossible for you."
7496,Sending all the love in the world.
7497,"Damn, sister...I am sorry."
7498,"Your sexual preferences are yours alone. No one can tell you who to love and who not to love, or tell you who you're attracted to. I applaud you for being honest with yourself about what you can handle and what you want. I'm so sorry you're going through this."
7499,"There may come a day that she regrets this, and all the suffering you will have gone through will have enabled you to look back in peace and know that you did not contribute to it and your actions gave her an outlet to reevaluate this decision. You‚Äôll know you did the right thing. 

If she doesn‚Äôt and she remains trans for life, you‚Äôll know that it wouldn‚Äôt have worked out anyway. 

If you want, it doesn‚Äôt appear to be too late to lay it all down for her and say anything you want to say to see if you can get through at all before this is said and done. Don‚Äôt hesitate to get real and fight for your marriage if you feel inclined. 

Otherwise...prepare for a long road. I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through this while we‚Äôre in the midst of chaos already."
7500,I'm so sorry. We've got you. We're here for you through this. We are your sisters and we will support you. You are not alone.
7501,"Damn. 15 years. I am so sorry. It's  I don't know. Sucky to say the least.

My sympathies."
7502,"I‚Äôm so sorry. When we choose a partner there are so many things about that person that makes them compatible to you. When your SO makes a decision or adopts a behavior that did not exist when you got together  you have every right to end the relationship. It could be gambling, infidelity, drugs, money, abuse, mental issues, personality changes. Changing your sex has to be at the top of the list. If my husband said I want to be a woman I would leave. I married a man. You married a woman.  If anyone judges you remove them from your life. I guarantee there are more people that will understand.  It‚Äôs very sad that a partner can change their gender and there are people who think that should not matter. I don‚Äôt understand the logic. That person is literally changing everything about themselves. That didn‚Äôt exist before."
7503,You‚Äôre doing the right thing. Trans ideology is nothing but toxicity and lies and you‚Äôre saving yourself a lot of damage by getting out now.
7504,"I'm so sorry for your loss. She's wrapped up in this cult thinking now, it's just taking over everywhere and it's hard not to get caught up in that. 

there was nothing you could do.

You might benefit from talking with other trans widows or lesbians about this too.

/r/truelesbians"
7505,I sent you a pm. Also sending hugs.
7506,"You were wise leaving. Thing could be way worst if you stayed there waiting for something. She just made her move, letting you on a checkmate situation."
7507,I don't know what to say to comfort you.. And I can't imagine the pain you're going through.. But we're here for you.. Im sorry you're going through this.
7508,">that the world will judge me harshly for not staying with her through transition

In today's climate, it is the case that a lot of people will judge you. Steel yourself. We're here for you as much as we can be."
7509,"Sorry you're going through this. I hope your wife rethinks things and finds peace in the body she's in. Either way, keep moving forward and take care of yourself."
7510,I am so sorry. Truly sorry. I would do the same thing if I couldn't get her help.  With so many detransitioning why would she want to do it now?
7511,"I am so sorry that your marriage is breaking up.  Couples grow apart for many reasons.  This is not your fault, or her fault really....it is the course of your lives that no longer are on the same path.   It will be a difficult time for your family, but many couples have parted ways and successfully co-parented after divorce.  I wish you strength during this change.  Be gentle with yourself."
7512,"I am so sorry you are going through this:(   People who make you feel guilty are being assholes.  Your wife is the one changing who she is, not you and you have every right to want to leave."
7513,"You can‚Äôt stay with someone you won‚Äôt love, I‚Äôm so sorry about your situation and I know it can‚Äôt be helped on either side. Just know I‚Äôm hoping things go well for the both of you."
7514,"this makes me think that i would never seek some relationships(well im giving up what i meant), its kinda depressing if you think about it also im so sorry this isnt also the first time i heard about that kind of thing, and you deserved better.."
7515,"This is heartbreaking and I just want to offer my sympathies to the already wonderful comments. Though I have my doubts, I do hope that your wife finds happiness on her new path. Mostly I want to say that I, personally, would absolutely leave in your shoes as well. If the world judges you harshly they can frankly fuck off because they do not know or own your situation. You are doing this with obvious pain in your heart and not because you're a ""transphobe"" or any other vacuous insult someone may hurl at you. Please feel free to post here with updates and let me/us know if we can help. Lots of love"
7516,"I know this is hard, and painful.  I don't know if it helps, but by ending it now you are saving yourself a lot more heartache down the road.  I wish both of you the best, and I'm sorry she is choosing this path."
7517,"I've no words of wisdom but I just want to say I'm sorry this is happening to you both.
You must do what feels right"
7518,If I was your friend I would do what I could to help you deal with your partner‚Äôs selfish decision to destroy your entire family.   I wouldn‚Äôt judge you for sadness or anger or the grief.   I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this.
7519,I'm sorry for your loss op.  I hope you and the kids are able to navigate this and that you and your wife are able to remain amicable for the kid's sake.
7520,"Glad you‚Äôre doing what‚Äôs best for you. While I think she might end up regretting this, we can‚Äôt control others, only ourselves. I‚Äôm so sorry"
7521,You don't deserve to go through this. Hope everything works out for you. 15 years is a long time. It's going to be hard but you will eventually come back stronger.
7522,"In the same situation...not nearly as long but still understand a lot, reading this breaks my own heart all over again because of how much it hurts to see someone you love so much be sucked into the transcult. Even worse when you can see and know how bad it is for her but she doesn't see it at all or believe how bad tras and this ""community"" is .."
7523,"I am so sorry for what you are going through. I would never judge someone for not wanting to be with a man or a women. I would leave my husband if he decided he was going to become a women. I don't know the right words, but I'm sending hugs your way."
7524,"No one would judge a woman for leaving her husband if he decided to transition to a woman. Nobody has the right to judge you. You have a right to decide who to be with and who not to be with. While she may feel that this is the right choice for her, she obviously didn't consider your family in the process. 

I'm sure that if you wanted to be with a man, you would've been with one instead of marrying a woman. If she doesn't understand that then she's definitely not the right person for you. 

I'm sorry things are going this way for you and your family. This has got to be extremely painful for all involved."
7525,"As a man I can tell you that it‚Äôs not you who has to leave. You are the woman. Kick ‚Äúhim‚Äù out of your house. The woman always gets the house, the kids and the money. Have a great day!"
7526,"I appreciate your honesty, although it is a huge deal for someone to not only vocalize but then follow through on a transition it is often over looked what happens with their partners. If a partner for their own well being cannot handle or cope with the decision it is so often (and wrong) to condemn them and such when they are thinking for their own well being. You are looking out for you, which is nothing at all horrible, wrong, or selfish. Good on you ‚ô•"
7527,"This is one seriously scary mid life crisis, if I was in your shoes though, I‚Äôd leave too. If my partner changed genders, I‚Äôm out. Lol This is big decision. You can still be her or his friend. You don‚Äôt have to force yourself to be attracted to males. She‚Äôs choosing to alter her body to look like a males. You are a lesbian. That is all you need to say. Just be her friend."
7528,"Did you see any signs? I'm sure it didn't happen in one day for her did anything change in her behaviour or discourse?

Did you ever talk about the trans issue in those 15years? Did you ever talk with her about the gender critical view with her? Don't you think you can make her change her mind or at least try?

It seems you immediately gave up on her, if she is your wife of 15years are you sure there is no way for you to get thourgh her? 

If you can't make her change her mind it is the best, for both of you to break up but maybe you can. Or maybe you had other issues in your relationship and don't want to fight for it or maybe you already tried, but if you didn't and care about her you have nothing to loose.

Show her video of detransitioners, talk about the radfem lens on trans ideology tell her you lover the way she is i mean i know i would try everything. 

(Maybe you already did but it just didn't seem that way in your post, it seems you passively accepted her new identifications first as non binary and then as a tif. If you already tried everything then just good luck for what's to come and you are doing the right thing.)"
7529,"Whatever makes YOU happy. You are a normal human being for thinking this and doing what you need to do.

It's not bashing her/him because of their decision, you clearly said you don't want to be with a man. 

That's totally fine. And your partner should be able to understand that"
7530,"The most respectable thing to do with her gender identity is acknowledging it. You're a lesbian and she identifies as a man - If the world judges you harsly it's undeserved. 

Good luck OP, glad that you stuck to your guns and put your needs first."
7531,"This situation is terrible for the family, especially the kids. I've read some devastating stories  from trans orphans. I'm so sad this has happened to you and your family. All the best. And I applaud your decision."
7532,"She's not going to be able to medically transition right now, given the world's health crisis. I pray that you both survive what is happening now in the world and that she finds it in herself to move past. Otherwise I'd say leave, but right now I'd say love."
7533,"Im sorry about this. You cant change who someone is, both in gender and sexuality, and It‚Äôs understandable that some people wouldn‚Äôt be able to make exceptions if their parenter identities as a gender that goes against their sexuality. My ex and I had the same thing, I am trans, he is straight. The best thing you can do is wish eachother well, and hopefully stay friends to support him"
7534,"If you decide you no longer want to be with your partner because your partner has decided they're don't feel comfortable with their gender, that is normal and valid and understandably hard on everyone.

When you misgender him, that's just a lot of fucking problems starting up."
7535,"You need to do whatever is right for you.

That said, the fact that you can‚Äôt see yourself connecting with a male version of her doesn‚Äôt mean you couldn‚Äôt connect with that version. It‚Äôs also OK to wait and see what happens and not decide yet. You can always leave, but you probably can‚Äôt come back. I‚Äôm not saying this for any ideological reason, but because you love this person and I don‚Äôt want you to lose them if you don‚Äôt have to.

Wishing you peace and solace in this difficult time."

7537,"I can't think of anything much more horrifying than discovering a *platonic* friend wanted to destroy their body in this way - let alone a partner.

My heart truly goes out to anyone in this situation."
7538,">This is her journey now, not yours. It‚Äôs ok to go on your own path. If you were my friend I‚Äôd be supportive and relieved you have decided to leave now rather than later.

Exactly."
7539,I also wanted to add that I absolutely 100 percent would not stay with a partner who wanted to change sex and you should feel absolutely no shame in that decision.
7540,I agree with all of this. And I‚Äôm sure this is the obvious but counseling/therapy for your kids.  Not only will they have to deal with their parents divorcing but having to weigh the major life/body changes your partner is going to go through.
7541,"I think plastic surgery is totally different than transitioning. I‚Äôve had a few. I had reasonable expectations going in, I didn‚Äôt hate myself and just wanted aesthetic improvements for myself and want to enjoy my body while I was young, and I didn‚Äôt think that having a more defined jawline or more defined cheeks was gonna change my whole life. My partner has been supportive but I wouldn‚Äôt blame any partner for leaving someone with body dysmorphic disorder who spent ridiculous amount on lots of surgery."
7542,I'm not sure why your partner dropping thousands of dollars on clothes would be comparable unless it's your money?
7543,"I found this very upsetting to read. Any breakup at this stage in life is awful but I feel like this is so much worse than a regular breakup. As well as being a total mind fuck you are losing the person they were, it's almost like a death in the family. And on top of all that there is the pressure to be supportive... supportive of your loved one using their body as an experiment, living a lie and destroying your family unit. I would feel so betrayed."
7544,Betrayal? Jesus Christ stop being so entitled you don‚Äôt fucking OWN your partner. I thought you all were feminists holy shit lmao.
7545,"> Older lesbians? They lean into it on the cusp of menopause.

That's an interesting observation. Menopause is certainly disconcerting, to be sure."
7546,This weird. I loved menopause. Nothing about it bothered me. It certainly did not give me any ideas  about transitioning.
7547,"I‚Äôm so glad you posted this. I have an acquaintance who wants to transition and I fear it‚Äôs a ploy for attention, given his history. But, if I say that out loud, I‚Äôm labeled as ‚Äútransphobic ‚Äú. I also have a close friend who is gay who feels the same way and is not comfortable being thrown in with what he calls ‚Äúthe alphabet crowd‚Äù. Being attracted to someone is not the same as wanting to alter your body permanently."
7548,YES!!!! Say it again so the back can hear!!!!!
7549,"I don't think that trying to fit her into a tiny womanhood box is the answer here. In order for something not to be invalidating to your womanhood, you have to have the concept of womanhood in the first place. What does it mean to her? Perhaps that's why she doesn't fit."
7550,My partner has said she is comfortable with female pronouns for now and will let me know when she wants to change them. But thanks for your concern.
7551,"It doesn‚Äôt go both ways if the op leans more with radical feminist ideology. Not really something you can make an exception for if you have those core values:/ I really feel sorry for her loss of her partner, I can‚Äôt imagine:/"
7552,"If she‚Äôs attracted to women and knows here and now that this is a dealbreaker, it‚Äôs best that she end things. I love my husband but if he decided to transition to female we‚Äôd have to end our sexual relationship. I‚Äôd be more willing to have a sexual relationship with a biologically female lesbian than a trans woman. Some of us can‚Äôt get past the uncanny valley feeling and others aren‚Äôt attracted to the gender that their partner is transitioning to. 

Also this is a gender critical thread. We tend to believe in loving who you love in the body you were born into."
7553,"If it went both ways, her wife wouldn't expect her to stay. It's absurd to expect a lesbian to stay married to a man, and that OP's wife seems to expect that shows that she doesn't actually believe she's a man."
7554,".... yeah, no"
7555,"Also, plastic surgery doesn‚Äôt totally change who you are. No one gets a nose job and then starts going by a different name and asking people to deny biology and change the English language to suit them."
7556,"Yes, it is different, but I recommend you go read up on radfem analysis of plastic surgery. We don't believe in the ""doing it for myself"" crap."
7557,"If you're married to them, the assumption is that the money is shared. So yes, partly your money. Even if my husband earned 100% of our income, I wouldn't stay with him if he was blowing it on shit we didn't need."
7558,">I'm not sure why your partner dropping thousands of dollars on clothes would be comparable unless it's your money.        

You really can't see why that's a problem? When adults are in serious  longterm relationships, financial decisions are almost always made together, esp if it entails amounts in the thousands...        

In all my adult years on this earth, I've never ever met a couple IRL that keeps financials separate in the way you describe. I don't know one person that would go out & drop money on something without discussing it first with a serious partner; because even if it is ""separate"", it really never is, esp in marriage. There's bills, food, other costs, that will inevitably be combined no matter how it can be  ""justified"".              
    
Even if say technically paychecks are somehow treated as completely ""separate"",  that person's spending still has potential consequences -- not paying for other home costs, pushing it off on the other person, possibly tanking credit scores, having their debts haunt a legal partner (collections, defaults, etc.), not holding up relationship compromises with working decisions (who does what, like staying home with kids), not supporting the rest of the family, etc.       

It's nothing like casual dating. People commit to more than just a person; they commit to a relationship & all the responsibility that comes with cohabitation/ marriage."
7559,"Life transitions developmentally shake up identity. Hence girls entering puberty ‚Äútransitioning.‚Äù Older lesbians, a lifetime of stigma, probably raised their kids (if hey had them), done that life stage, body is changing again, maybe a partner transitioned or passed on or they want to see what other options there are, or they want to see if they can, after a lifetime, get the male privilege they never had access to. That PLUS the enormous pressure lever on them by activists.... the mechanisms are all there."
7560,"Also, just saw the congruence of your handle to this subject matter‚Äî wonderful."
7561,"Yes as a lesbian, having the acceptance we've gained in society eroded away by a group of people who have nothing in common with us is especially frustrating and quite scary to watch.  We will see the scars of this movement on the lesbian population for years to come"
7562,"Oh that's fine then, I was just worried"
7563,"I have. I understand the social constructs that influenced my choice of the elective parts of what I had done. I had an overbite/recessed jaw/concave face that was medically classified as a deformity. I had it fixed both functionally and cosmetically (insurance covered the first part), because as shitty as the world is to need me to look a certain way, I didn‚Äôt deserve to suffer for it, either. It‚Äôs a little crapola on your part to assume I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about and to apply feminist theory to me literally correcting a congenital anomaly to look normal."
7564,That is not the assumption in many married relationships. And thousands of dollars on basic necessities doesn't seem ridiculous. I would sure get divorced if my partner was preventing me from CLOTHING MYSELF or micromanaging what I spent on necessities.
7565,"A lot of partners keep financials separate and that's what we generally advise women to do on this sub. I personally know many people who do (they might have joint accounts for bills but will keep the rest of their earnings separate). While lesbian couples are likely exempt from this because we normally advise this for Men Reasons, I don't even think thousands of dollars is that much to spend on clothes? Like, depends if you're buying sweatshop clothes and live in a cold climate I guess but in colder climates a decent winter coat alone can cost upwards of a thousand. I would be pretty mad if a partner of idk how many years told me I couldn't spend my own salary on clothing for myself.

IDK why you're talking down to me about long term cohabitation as if I'm too stupid to know what it involves."
7566,I wonder if there's a fear of ageing mixed in there too.
7567,I first joined reddit to find a menopause sub to talk about perimenopause but didn't interact much. Then I realised that GC was where the radfem party was going on. üëê
7568,"I hear ya! Please don‚Äôt get me wrong. As long as what someone does isn‚Äôt hurting anyone, I honestly don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt care who you love or what you do with them as long as they‚Äôre a consenting adult. I don‚Äôt care if grown adults want to dress in a non-conforming way, either. However, when we start altering people‚Äôs bodies in ways that can be life altering, I think it‚Äôs time to step back and think about it. It‚Äôs especially disturbing when it‚Äôs done to children. Their fertility and future sexual functions are impacted. I also think it‚Äôs rather presumptive to assume that anyone who lives in a way that‚Äôs non-traditional should jump on the bandwagon. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that people are blaming what‚Äôs happening to trans children on the ‚Äúgay agenda‚Äù. To me, that‚Äôs like blaming terrorism or the Catholic pedo problem on all religious people. I‚Äôm a religious person, but I don‚Äôt agree with those things. I love everyone as Christ commanded. And I just want people to be able to live their lives."
7569,">thousands of dollars on basic necessities doesn't seem ridiculous.

???? I don't know what you're picturing when I say ""thousands of dollars on clothes."" I'm talking about dropping that ALL AT ONCE, not over years. You're deliberately misinterpreting what I'm saying. I am NOT talking about basic necessities."
7570,there‚Äôs a line between buying the amount of clothes you need and people who spend ridiculous amounts of money on clothes for fashion
7571,"You're living in some kind of alternate universe if you think most people spend upwards of a thousand dollars on their winter coat in ANY climate.  Spending thousands of dollars at once on clothing is something that is literally unthinkable for most people, and a major hit to the budget for most middle class and even upper middle class families.

I mean who are you, Richie Rich?  Most of the rest of us cannot relate. Get some perspective."
7572,"Oh, you‚Äôre absolutely right! Just like with puberty but different reasoning. 

Fear of aging as in missing out on being treated like a human.

Fear of age of as in seeing how shitty older women are treated.

Fear of age if as in this can‚Äôt be my body, my body is betraying me, I‚Äôll take control of my body instead and make it in man‚Äôs image. Then I‚Äôll own it, then all this change I‚Äôve been conditioned to see as equivalent to losing worth (in a male society, even if a lesbian)... then it will all make sense.

Fear of age of as in fear of death, of weakness, of losing control, of facing the unknown, desire to quell that fear by becoming a creator, a dr. Frankenstein, sculptor & giver of and recipient of due life.


It all comes from somewhere, this rejection of the self. I pity them."
7573,"I joined Reddit way before that but needed a similar support group. I'm going through many emotional changes and as I get into my older 30s (and.... holy crap when did that happen) can relate to or feel a connection to many stories like this. I'm also divorced, so there's this added bonus of feeling ""fuck you"" to societal norms of  ""date someone, get engaged, have pre-wedding parties, get married, settle down, buy a house, suddenly have 3 kids back to back while mom works from home etc etc"" NO NO NO. I will NEVER have that life and I don't agree with the notion of selling my body anymore either. 

That became longer than I realized but YES here for same reason :)"
7574,I think your stance on these issues is very respectable
7575,"oh ok, that wasn't clear to me from context. I agree that spending thousands on clothing in one go seems ridiculous, but I didn't think that was the point being made."
7576,"Sure I just think that 'someone who spends thousands on clothes' doesn't sound at all out of the norm or ridiculous, and if they make their own money it seems like a really OTT thing to micromanage. I just don't really know anyone who micromanages their partners' spending like that and if they did I would assume it was an abuse situation. Then again most people I know work, I basically don't know anyone who is on a single income and many people don't combine their finances except for bills and shared necessities like food, so they are free to spend the rest of their money on what they want."
7577,"Spending thousands of dollars on *anything* requires budgeting, communication and planning for any working or middle class family, couple or partners. How nice to be upper class eh?"
7578,"Where I live yes, a warm winter coat will absolutely cost you 1k plus. I am not living in an alternative universe, just a climate that gets cold in the winter. 

Even when I was growing up VERY poor clothing cost probably at least 1k per year just from THRIFT STORES if you counted everything. Maybe it was more because I was growing, and I'm still very poor and not actively growing so I probably spend slightly less now, but not by much.

Probably depends on the country where you're living but here it's close to impossible to spend less considering season changes. 

I'm living under the poverty line actually but lol at ""Richie Rich"" and telling me to get perspective."
7579,"Very insightful. You could put all this together and make a good argument worthy of a post in it's own right, I think. About trans and, well, transitions in the generic sense of the word."
7580,"I wish we were taught or warned about how much the female body actually changes throughout our lives. My hormones have changed dramatically throughout my 10s, 20s and 30s.

I've heard women are at their peak concentration of hormones around ages 28-35 ish I think? I believe it. Everything felt very intense. Not only physically, but the emotional changes were significant.

Ugh."
7581,"My comment was based on actual accounts from the wives of TIMs who decide they're women and go out and buy entire new wardrobes/makeup/jewelry for themselves, spending thousands of dollars... usually more than what the wife would have been buying for herself."
7582,"You are under the poverty line and spend that much on a winter coat.  Bullshit.  I am way above the poverty line and live in a cold ass climate and spend a small fraction of that on a winter coat.  NO ONE NEEDS A THOUSAND DOLLAR COAT.  NO ONE.  They don't need thousand dollar coats in SIBERIA.

And a thousand per year on all clothing is not what was being talked about.  That doesn't seem unreasonable.

Sorry to harp on the coat thing but I just don't get it, frankly."
7583,"I've lived in northern canada and have never spent anywhere near 1000$ on a winter coat. And if a coat costs enough it could impact affording rent, bills, etc. you should definitely talk it over with your partner to make a budget so you can afford it."
7584," No way would I spend over 1000 on a winter coat. And I live in a cold climate! (I know there are people who do, though.)"
7585,"I live in the cold upper north. No, spending even more than $200 on a cost is freakishly abnormal. Where do you live?"
7586,"I lived in Alaska, where winter averages -30f, no one spent 1k on a single coat. I think the average for a quality coat was about $250-$300, but most people just bought one for like $100 and wore layers of sweaters underneath. Boots were about $150-$250 and a good pair lasted you a few years. I grew up with thrift store clothes, I don't think my parents spent more than $200 a year on me, and even now that I am an adult and I buy my own clothing from malls I only spend about $200-$300 per year. My wife an I discuss every purchase over a couple hundred dollars, and constantly go over finances, even though she's very much a believer that our money is separate."
7587,"¬£1000 on winter coat in one season?
Are you for real?
GTF out of this sub
Thank you"
7588,"It can frequently get - 40¬∞ F in the winter where I live (we had a week like that last year, our kitchen window cracked because of the heat difference).

**Nobody** spends 1k on a coat here. You'd be much better off buying a snowblower with that money. Or a car starter. Or winter tires. Or literally any other winter gear that actually costs that much."
7589,"Could do. Takes a lot of energy. I invite anyone to do so if they please.
It‚Äôs kinda my day job and I get worn out.

But, thank you for the kind appraisal."
7590,"Ah, that makes way more sense. From that perspective I absolutely understand what you're saying."
7591,"I personally did not spend that much on a coat (I buy coats extremely oversized and then layer several sweaters underneath lol) but it is ABSOLUTELY the norm where I live including among poor people. I don't know what cold climate you live in, and maybe you have cheaper consumer goods there, but when most of my peers are spending several hours outside every day in temperatures of minus 20 or colder, just to walk to work or to the grocery store, yes they need warm coats and buying a warm coat for significantly under 1k is very difficult here. 

They literally do need thousand dollar coats in siberia unless they're wearing fur? Where i live is almost as cold as siberia and colder than moscow lol."
7592,Me? Why should I? I'm not the one saying I would break up with a partner of 15 years over 1k worth of clothing.
7593,"I haven't done it either but I suffer hardcore. 90% of people I know have coats that expensive, including people who are really poor. The rest are fucking cold all the time."
7594,"I don't want to say where I live but if you live in the US it's probably colder than there, unless you live in Alaska. The US also has MUCH cheaper consumer goods than where I live, like by factors of several.

Most people I see on the street own coats from brands that don't sell them for under 8 or 9 hundred. I am an exception but I have to buy coats 3-4 sizes too large so I can layer several wool sweaters underneath."
7595,"The US has much lower prices on consumer goods than my country does and I imagine most people in Alaska own cars while we don't here so people spend long amounts of time outside every day. I imagine that accounts for the difference. From my understanding clothing is VERY cheap in the US. 

I just don't think it's a norm among people I know to discuss personal item purchases with a partner and I grew up in pretty severe poverty with my whole extended family being pretty poor. I know a lot of rich people from college and they definitely don't, but even when growing up my mom NEVER asked my dad for permission to buy stuff like clothes. This is just really really weird to me."
7596,"Not pounds, dollars lol?

This is just facts lol."
7597,Do you live somewhere where most people drive? I do not. I only know about 2 people who own cars.
7598,"This is what i think is happening to Sarah Bettens, the singer of K's Choice."
7599,Because spending a large sum that could impact the ability to afford rent/bills/food/etc. directly impacts your partner if you live together. I don't see how this is controversial to you.
7600,Wow. My experience is very different - and it's cold here! But there it is.
7601,"So you live in a super rich neighborhood that actually doesn't need much winter protection? For fucks sake, this is insane."
7602,"I thought of her, too."
7603,"I'm not sure why you think this made-up scenario affects me.

Where I live the risk of not having adequately warm winter clothing would probably have a much more severe effect on someone's partner than ""losing"" that much money on a coat that lasts several years. Most people in my demo don't own cars so hours of walking outside daily is the norm and that can be in -40 or colder temps in some cases. I have literally never heard of anyone coat-purchase-shaming anyone here, unless it's fur (the cheaper, but less ""ethical"" warm option)."
7604,No I live in a poor immigrant neighbourhood.

Girls sue to block participation of transgender athletes

The families of three female high school runners have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block transgender athletes in Connecticut from participating in girls sports

By PAT EATON-ROBB AP Sports Writer

February 12, 2020

HARTFORD, Conn. -- The families of three female high school runners filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday seeking to block transgender athletes in Connecticut from participating in girls sports.

Selina Soule, a senior at Glastonbury High School, Chelsea Mitchell, a senior at Canton High School and Alanna Smith, a sophomore at Danbury High School are represented by the conservative nonprofit organization Alliance Defending Freedom. They argue that allowing athletes with male anatomy to compete has deprived them of track titles and scholarship opportunities.

‚ÄúMentally and physically, we know the outcome before the race even starts,"" said Smith, who is the daughter of former Major League pitcher Lee Smith. ‚ÄúThat biological unfairness doesn't go away because of what someone believes about gender identity. All girls deserve the chance to compete on a level playing field.‚Äù

The lawsuit was filed against the Connecticut Association of Schools-Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference and the boards of education in Bloomfield, Cromwell, Glastonbury, Canton and Danbury.

‚ÄúForcing girls to be spectators in their own sports is completely at odds with Title IX, a federal law designed to create equal opportunities for women in education and athletics,‚Äù attorney Christiana Holcomb said. ""Connecticut‚Äôs policy violates that law and reverses nearly 50 years of advances for women.‚Äù

The Connecticut Association of Schools-Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference says its policy follows a state anti-discrimination law that says students must be treated in school by the gender with which they identify and the group believes the policy is ‚Äúappropriate under both state and federal law.‚Äù

The lawsuit follows a Title IX complaint filed last June by the girls' families and the Alliance Defending Freedom with the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, which is investigating the policy.

The lawsuit centers on two transgender sprinters, Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood, who have frequently outperformed their cisgender competitors.

The two seniors have combined to win 15 girls state indoor or outdoor championship races since 2017, according to the lawsuit.

The three plaintiffs have competed directly against them, almost always losing to Miller and usually behind Yearwood. Mitchell finished third in the 2019 state championship in the girls 55-meter indoor track competition behind Miller and Yearwood.

‚ÄúOur dream is not to come in second or third place, but to win fair and square,‚Äù Mitchell said. ‚ÄúAll we're asking for is a fair chance.‚Äù

Yearwood, of Cromwell High School, and Miller, of Bloomfield High School, have both defended their participation in girls events.

Yearwood told The Associated Press in February 2019 that there are many differences among athletes that may give one a physical advantage over another, and that she does not think she has an unfair advantage.

""One high jumper could be taller and have longer legs than another, but the other could have perfect form, and then do better,"" she said. ""One sprinter could have parents who spend so much money on personal training for their child, which in turn, would cause that child to run faster.""

Yearwood's mother said the athlete had no immediate comment on Wednesday's lawsuit. Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The attorneys are asking the court to prevent the transgender girls from competing while the lawsuit moves forward. No hearing date on that request had been scheduled Wednesday, the day before the state's indoor track championships begin.

Connecticut is one of 17 states that allowed transgender high school athletes to compete without restrictions in 2019, according to Transathlete.com, which tracks state policies in high school sports across the country. Eight states had restrictions that make it difficult for transgender athletes to compete while in school, such requiring athletes to compete under the gender on their birth certificate, or allowing them to participate only after going through sex reassignment procedures or hormone therapies, according to Transathlete.

Yearwood and Miller have said they are still in the process of transitioning but have declined to provide details."
7609,"And of course the thread on /rall is locked. I guess too many fee fees and not enough validation happened. Die mad, TRAs!"
7610,"I knew there was no way those Connecticut track girls were happy or accepting of boys unfairly beating them and taking their titles/awards. Even the most woke person can see this is incredibly unfair and this does nothing to improve trans acceptance. Hopefully they win their case. That boy and his mother had the gall to say that he worked hard to win and break records, implying those girls didnt win because they didnt work hard enough to overcome the biological advantage males have. I hope they restore old records from actual girls that these boys stole."
7611,"The comments are spot on. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve always said - TRAs will end up completely shooting themselves in the foot over this ridiculous idea that sex-based rights are transphobic. Because when presented with actual real-life situations, most people become terfs..... or, you know, realists."
7612,It's so sad to see a formerly courageously-principled organization like the ACLU come down on the wrong side of this issue. Postmodern gender ideology is so insidious; it poisons everything it touches.
7613,"This very issue is what helped peak me about a year ago. The males in question have done literally nothing except maybe grow their hair out/get extensions and adopt a girls name. That's it. Other than that they are as full fledged boys as any other boy. One of them had the nerve to say something like ""well the other girls should just work harder"" or some shit. F\*ck off dude. Neither of them placed higher than like 8th in the boys division and then suddenly they're winning state championships as girls, big fucking surprise."
7614,">‚ÄúThe idea that the law only protects the individuals with XX chromosomes as compared to individuals with XY chromosomes is found nowhere in the legislative history of Title IX, in any implementing regulation or in any other aspect of the interpretation of Title IX over the last 50 years by the courts,‚Äù he said.

This is why biological sex matters and words matter. When that legislation was made, we all knew ""woman"" meant ""XX"" and nobody had to fucking say it. Title IX is about WOMEN, that means XX chromosomes and all that goes along with that in the vast majority of cases. If XY people are included as well, in this lawyer's asinine statement, then Title IX also includes cis men and is completely invalid and schools no longer have to make sure women are getting sports teams and equal chances to participate. You could just have one team of regular boys and another of boys who say they identify as women, and now you've met Title IX requirements.

You'd think a fucking lawyer would think through the implications of their statements before speaking... jesus fucking christ.

Edit: please forgive any crude oversimplifications of Title IX; I am Canadian so I only understand the basics."
7615,Good for them. The really brave and stunning young women in this situation.
7616,"This is great! When I found out a trans man won a women's cycling race a while ago, I was so pissed, especially since that's a sport that's really important to me and I know how difficult it is to train for this. The dude essentially stole the victory from a girl who deserved the win. The same goes for essentially any other sport. This crap needs to stop"
7617,"This is what a bunch of ""human rights"" groups, including the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, said in response to the complaint filed:

>‚ÄúAs organizations that care deeply about ending discrimination against women and girls, we support laws and policies that protect transgender people from discrimination, including in participation in sports. Together, we reject unfounded fears about transgender athletes in our state and reject the suggestion that cisgender women and girls benefit from the exclusion of women and girls who happen to be transgender. Instead, we recognize that all women and girls are harmed when some are denied opportunities to participate in sports because of stereotypes and fear.‚Äù

Makes my blood boil. Note how they phrase biological women as ""cisgender women"" but phrase TIMs as ""women and girls who ***happen to be*** transgender"". 

#**internally screaming**"
7618,"Yes, keep defending the xy people of the world, they've never had a fighting chance being male, no privileges, no advantages, nothing, these poor poor little boys and their struggles to protect their delicate egos.

I juuust..... Can't. Like, we have a special Olympics, so hey, let's make a trans Olympics. Stop the invasion of women's spaces!!"
7619,"I'm trying to find an article from February 2019 in which Chelsea Mitchell came in 3rd behind Yearwood and Miller and was trying to deal with it, when by all rights she should have taken first place.  It was heart breaking.  She was bewildered, trying to absorb that males had been allowed to compete, she knew it was unfair at its core, but was biting her tongue not to say anything unPC.

I'm glad she's on this lawsuit.  Hopefully, there will be an injunction against the cheaters, then they can work on restoring the titles to the rightful winners, declaring Miller's and Yearwood's times null and void."
7620,"The body being sued by these girls, Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference, just released this statement:

>CHESHIRE, Conn. ‚Äì The Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference (CIAC) is committed to equity in providing opportunities to student athletes in Connecticut. In 2013 the CIAC adopted its current policy regarding transgender participation in athletics. When first adopting that policy and when subsequently reviewing it, the CIAC consulted with and relied on statements and advice from numerous bodies and organizations, including the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities, the Connecticut State Department of Education, the National Federation of State High School Associations, and the Office for Civil Rights.  The CIAC believes that its current policy is appropriate under both state and federal law, and it has been defending that policy in the complaint that was filed previously with the Office of Civil Rights.  Although OCR‚Äôs investigation is still pending, the CIAC is aware that a lawsuit has now also been filed in federal court. The CIAC will respond to that lawsuit after we have a chance to review it further.

Let me fix that...

""according to Transathlete.com, which tracks state policies in high school sports across the country. Eight states recognize the rights of women and bar men from participating in women's sports, making it difficult for male athletes to compete at an advantage against women, logically concluding that they need to play among other men. Some are generous and allow them to participate after getting surgery, but most don't even do that, and just require them to provider a doctor's note that suggests they take hormones."""
7623,Is anyone else wondering about the Olympics? Are we going to see a surge in transgender competitors now that the rules have changed?
7624,"There was an article last week in my hometown newspaper about the recent legislation brought in several states banning trans athletes in schools, and I read the comments.  One was from some handmaiden who said that winning wasn't the point of the sport, that the girls should be playing for the love of the game.  At this level, sure love of the game is great, but there are RECORDS and AWARDS and SCHOLARSHIPS on the line!  And why can't Yearwood and Miller just run for ""the love of the game"" and not to be best?  Shows how seriously people take women's sports today even.  I'm not even INTO sports and I'm FURIOUS."

This is what happens when we lose our language and ""women"" no longer means female. It means that laws created to protect women are now a tool to oppress them because ""women"" can be people with XY chromosomes too, and they are also a protected class under federal law. 

Also the quote by the trans runner was moronic and misogynistic, fuck him."

You don't just get to shoehorn in gender identity now that the same legislative title could be construed to defend the rights of natal women to participate in sports and other opportunities on their terms, without having to compete against natal males.

7665,"Chase Strangio, the lawyer quoted, is a TIF. She‚Äôs also wrong.

Title IX:
> No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

There language is clear‚Äî ‚Äúon the basis of sex‚Äù. These young men are not being excluded on the basis of their sex because the school already offers a team for ‚Äúindividuals with XY chromosomes‚Äù, the boys team. Yearwood and Miller have the same opportunities afforded to any other male classmate to try out for and participate on their schools‚Äô teams.

The problem for them (that no one wants to mention) is that their times in the boys field are laughably average. In the state meets they wouldn‚Äôt even qualify for the sprint prelims, much less the finals.

Miller‚Äôs best time in the 100m is an 11.74. The cutoff at the CT outdoor track state championship in the boys 100m prelims last year was 11.61. Yearwood‚Äôs times have actually gotten worse since he started going up against Miller. His fastest 100m in 2019 was a 12.22. 

As for Strangio, she is legitimately deranged. Seriously. That Chase refuses to recognize her own (and others) biological sex is her issue. That she takes it out on the rest of us is disgusting."
7666,"He knows it.  He's being disingenuous.   It's not in the legislative history because the definition of ""woman"" or ""man"" has been stable for the entirety of human history until this point.  Legislators aren't usually required to explicitly spell out universal truths understood by everyone in legislation.   God I hope the courts don't bite onto this bullshit argument.   It completely undermines the entire legislative purpose of Title IX.  If anyone can just declare themselves a member of a protected class, then protected classes no longer exist.

His interpretation, if accepted by courts, would set a dangerous precedent that could apply to other protected classes too.  After all, if one can identify as the opposite sex, it follows logically that one could identify as any age, race, or disabled status too."
7667,">This is great! When I found out a trans man won a women's cycling race a while ago, I was so pissed,

7766,We should use this tactic against them. Two women are week are murdered by their partners or exes because they are women. It would be letting down these murdered women if we don‚Äôt keep female sport for females only. It‚Äôs also a crazy argument - how does it let down murder victims to not let people play a sport?
7767,"I watched a debate, this trans woman who was actually against basically everything that trans people are doing, said ""what about the over 6000 women who were murdered last year?

We don't need to stoop to the level of TiMs by celebrating or calling for the deaths of trans people. This attitude just gives them more fuel for their fire.

I will always call for justice any time someone has their life unfairly taken away from them, no matter what their sexual identity, gender preference, etc. is. It's possible to be both gender critical and anti-murder.

Now, using the death of TiMs to argue for your desire to essentially cheat in sports? That's exploiting your own community and deserves to be called out."
7784,"My mom isn't male-aligned either (I have a brother, she doesn't treat him differently to me), but I still think it's true that many are. I know multiple women in real life who are generally wonderful, but when it comes to their precious sons all of a sudden all bets are off. When one of them got into the situation of her son's girlfriend daring to separate from him, I was honestly shocked how she changed from one of the kindest women I know to ice-cold when speaking about the son's ex.

7803,"Juniper is always going to be his 'go to' victim when he needs to blame someone other than himself because she has always filled that role for him. Bullying you would have been a challenge but Juniper is easy to manipulate because of the kids. Domestic violence is often hidden because the impact of public acknowledgement on the children would be highly negative, but sometimes it is only by bringing things into the cold light of day that things cool down. It is always a risk to take private issues public but since it is already in the public domain, thanks to your excellent piece on Stroud, there is no point in not letting the world know that his abuse is ongoing. I would avidly read any follow up story about the mental and emotional abuse suffered by women at the hands of men who they no longer have a domestic relationship with.

Edit : punctuation."
7804,"Hello. I was a print reporter for over 13 years. Do your editors generally have your back and support  you? If so, keep your eye on the public records.  If anything becomes official, record wise, it's fair game. Do a story on her wildlife sanctuary  and all the good it does. Images and everything.  Her narrative should not be dictated by that asshole. People like helping people who help animals. This could become a dominant part of her public persona."
7805,"I don't understand why the police aren't involved due to his threats and harrassment. Why, also, if he is successful, aren't his wages garnished or bank accounts frozen for non-payment? Lastly, why hasn't your investigation and exposure of him resulted in a very public shaming? Oh, right, I forgot-he's part of the MOST oppressed group and is, therefore, above reproach. (vomit)"

7812,"What part of ""he is literally a rapist and domestic abuser"" do these defenders not get? I can understand men defending him; they always protect each other. Other women defending this asshole and harassing his victim? They are complicit and should pay a price. I am ashamed of them."
7813,"Just so everyone knows, the offender‚Äôs books are listed on multiple review sites."
7814,"I'll venture into the waters here to introduce myself as the 'new' partner that's been referenced by some here. We've been together for four and a half years and married for almost four. We have a very stable and healthy marriage and I've been co-parenting the son that Meredith refuses to care for since just after he turned one. We've been in court one way or another because of Meredith for several years now to the tune of about $30,000 out of pocket. Since the time that affidavit was written, the past due support has passed the $20k mark. Meredith has used any imaginable trick to avoid this obligation including repeatedly moving, having their roommate cash checks and send money through PayPal, and so on. In court they went so far as to throw a tantrum at the thought of having to pay for medical expenses because they didn't approve of Juniper marrying me and taking our son off of welfare. They're that horrible of a person. 

I know that being a TiM myself I'm not the most likable person here, but I hope that at least in this situation you can understand that I'm a person with a good heart who wants nothing but the best for Juniper and our family. I have a lot of issues with the trans community to the point where I tend to keep myself distanced and am called a transphobe or TERF when I do speak. It's an odd place to be in. The silence this article was met with within the community has been infuriating. 

Thank you very much for all of the help in keeping Juniper safe from this creep and for helping to protect our family.

All of that said,  I just wanted to add my part to the discussion."
7815,The power these men receive by simply claiming to be a woman is genuinely terrifying. No wonder they've been popping up so much.

7818,"I was very surprised that the woman in the article is in a new relationship with a TiM. She‚Äôs also struck me as having no self confidence - she said that if one person benefits from her vile ex-husband‚Äôs story, then all her pain was worth it. (No it was not, and consider the damage to the kids, honey, it was not!) I get the impression that this woman is vulnerable and insecure and this makes her such a terrific target. You know the bullies will go after the weakest. Maybe she needs to get away from the LGBTQ insanity dome and start seeing her worth. A bit of confidence could make her less a giant red mark for the bulls. Is the reporter telling her about GC? Does this woman know we exist?

Edit: then/than :)"

7826,"I was at school studying all day, and I had no idea I would come back to this.

Actual\_Feminism on Twitter alerted me to that things were blowing up on here. I had been told the post might not be approved when I first signed up. 

Thank you all so, so much. Juniper sends her thanks as well.

When I spoke to her this morning, and she was in tears and telling me how Christmas would be cancelled for her family because of the costs incurred due to the legal threats from Stroud, I was exacerbated and did not know what to do. I was in contact with some feminist friends who were trying to get me help in the backend, but I had come here more to rant than anything else. 

Thank you so, so much.

7829,"Thank you for your bravery as a GC feminist journalist. Many women who aren‚Äôt doing freelance work around these issues are forced to stay silent in order to keep their jobs.

Keep it up and don‚Äôt be afraid to continue posting here for support."
7830,"I feel this is the elephant in the room but do we know anything about the other man saying he is a woman she is dating now? Because fragile women in precarious situations are often the targets of multiple abusers and end up in the same pattern of relationships several times. Do we know if he is decent?

Can't he help her with her financial trouble? Do we know if he will not take the money we all are sending to her go fund me?

Abusive men and trans identified abusive men very often say they are the victimest victims and he could probably say he needs the money more for his hormones or whatever. We know she is still very impressionable and manipulable as she still says that the first MTT raping her beating her and almost killing her was worth it if his book helped some trans identified man or whatever.

It is a well known fact that victims of domestic abuse often go through several abusive relationships. It would be great if we knew she isn't the victim of an abusive narcissistic TIM again.

PS: thanks for your great journalist work."
7831,"I would be happy to help Juniper, I am sure many women and men will. She can set up a gofundme."
7832,"This is downright despicable.

There needs to be an anonymous female superhero vigilante taking these men to task.

For the record, I am not that person, but I wouldn't be sad if there was someone out there doing it. If you get my drift."
7833,"It's fucking insane that any abusive man can erase his past (and current) crimes simply by saying, *""I'm a trans-woman!""*. The TRAs and the handmaidens seem to believe that a person is magically reborn when they claim to be trans and therefore deserve to be absolved of any and all past transgressions. And if their victims continue to seek justice, THEY'RE the problem and they need to be silenced.

&#x200B;

It's no wonder that so many gross, misogynist straight men with a history of abusing others are suddenly ""discovering their inner woman"". It's basically a real life Get Out Of Jail Free Card! And it's super easy now that being trans no longer requires any sort of serious medical or psychological gate-keeping."
7834,Disgusting no one in the trans community has condemned this
7835,"Hi,

I‚Äôve agreed not to speak publicly about my ex so this comment is 100% about myself and I won‚Äôt be adding much to the discussion, but I wanted to say:

I appreciate the outpouring of support, more than I can possibly say. This has been very scary for me and I am so thankful to Anna for helping me feel less alone and less helpless dealing with all of it. I honestly didn‚Äôt expect any of this and it‚Äôs been a huge emotional whirlwind.

The update I added to the GoFundMe where I described my relationship with radical feminism as ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù wasn‚Äôt intended to be a condemnation fo radical feminism, but the opposite. I‚Äôm in a weird position in that I struggle with gender dysphoria but I hold a lot of beliefs in common with gender-critical feminists. I was intending to express that, although I know that a lot of radfems are very untrusting of people like me, I‚Äôm never offended by anyone‚Äôs support or compassion, and I‚Äôd absolutely never dox or betray someone who helped me. 

I hope my attempt to express gratitude and acknowledgement of the source of the donations didn‚Äôt end up alienating or offending anyone. I‚Äôm thankful for the help. And I need it now. Not just financially, but emotionally, mentally‚Äî I feel like I‚Äôve taken a huge, dangerous leap and have to trust that there are people who will catch me. Seeing a lot of people coming together for me has been awe-inspiring and has helped me keep some hope that things will be ok. 

I did see some comments from people concerned about my marriage to Tristen now. I understand that from the outside, without knowing either of us, it could definitely look like some kind of trauma-induced leap from one toxic relationship into another, but that‚Äôs really not the case here. 

I won‚Äôt say that being trans has nothing to do with me and Tris‚Äôs relationship, because it does. One of the things that initially bonded us to each other was that we both felt very alone within the trans/dysphoric community because we felt that our experiences and beliefs were very different from the typical narrative, and we were both very frustrated with what we both saw as an epidemic of abusive behavior within the community being written off as acceptable. We actually have a very happy and healthy relationship and she is wonderful to me and has been instrumental in helping me survive and heal. 

There was one comment from someone who said she wouldn‚Äôt have donated if she knew I was married to a TiM now. Can that person please contact me? I‚Äôll Paypal you back the amount you donated. 

Again, thank you all.

Please don‚Äôt interpret my silence in this thread as apathy or ingratitude‚Äî I‚Äôm just trying to keep myself safe.

7836,"If this were a lesbian partner people would have no issues with calling ‚ÄúMeredith‚Äù out as abusive, a rapist, a deadbeat, and undeserving of any of her accolades. So are we judging TW by women‚Äôs standards, or are they not actually women? :)"

7843,"Saw this story pop up on my FB timeline today.  How sick & disturbing the way the rapist/abuser tries to blame mental illness & make himself look like the victim...not to mention utterly predictable.  It's what men do.

I have nothing to offer but this:  More people are peaking every day.  You are not alone; I see it happening in all walks of life... people getting fed up to their ears with this insanity.  The recent Southpark episode, the Dave Chappelle piece, daily 'top comments' mocking supposedly serious pro-trans videos & articles on VICE & similar news outlets... These are mainstream publications & outlets so they're a pretty accurate representation of the public at large.  Black women on Lipstick Alley are not here for the trans shit.  Many tampon-buying women are not having the erasure of women by Always.  And on & on.  

So please understand that your work is not in vain.  It may take a while but every drop fills the bucket that much further.  I hope everyone does their part to share the story far & wide so more people see it.  I sure will because it was one of the more disturbing things I'd seen in a long time.  Thank you for giving a victim a voice."
7844,"So, they got married in June 2013, the wife got pregnant and a few months later her husband decided to become ""her true self"". And he's an abuser, how... common. I've got this impression that the wife believed that the transition was a cure to his mental illness resulting in abuse so she just had to be patient. Until she couldn't anymore.

Then she married another transwoman (guilt?) but is still a terf.

7870,"Yeah, her ""niceness"" and ""tolerance"" towards him is something I find extremely toxic. Women who are ""nice"" and ""tolerant"" towards abusers are typically the ones who are champing at the bit to shame and ostracize other women for not being the same way. They are the queen NLOGS, the wokiest wokes, the sanctimonious ""good girls."" Women who get their self esteem by being the goodest good girl doormats need to throw non-doormat women under the bus as bad girls.

She should get justice in the legal system for his crimes against her. But I'm not offering a dime to her go fund me because I'm certain she would denounce me in a heartbeat for not calling that rapist ""she."" If a woman going to insist on niceness towards an abuser when he threatens to kill her, she's going to insist on niceness towards him when he threatens to kill me."

7874,"This edit on one of the negative reviews of his debut novel was painful to read:

*I have edited this review because some of what I said hurt members of the trans community, as well as those who love and support them. I have always believed myself to be one of this latter group, but my actions regarding this review did not reflect that. I am deeply sorry for what I said and the upset it caused.* ***I also apologise for becoming defensive when others tried to educate me as to why I was hurtful.*** *Many times people have told me that my opinion is ""wrong"" or ""stupid"" and I thought this was that same old argument.* ***But I was very wrong and I should have seen that. I'm embarrassed that I got it so wrong. I hope my updated review is more respectful and I will try to do better in future.***

I've never seen this level of pandering on any negative review ever."

It also wouldn't surprise me if she got with another TiM to diffuse accusations of ""transphobia"" and assure people that she's still a Good Liberal.

&#x200B;

I don't think being a nice/kind natured woman is ""toxic"" per se. Women are generally nice and tolerant towards everyone including abusers and the male horde which is one of the reasons why women/females are the superior gender. Kindness is NOT a weakness, it is a strength and one that men in general, especially trans men seem to lack. Anger and hatred, which are typical male traits, are easy and regressive.

Which society would be a superior one?  
  
A society made entirely of NICE women or a society made entirely of ANGRY men?

I'm honestly not sure how to answer all of this.

I'll answer as best I can in my own words. 

I transitioned because after growing up sheltered with very uneducated grandparents, I finally stumbled onto something that was the 'aha!' moment for feelings I'd struggled with for a lot of my life. I experienced the cliche feeling of peace as my body started to match what it felt like in my mind, etc etc. 

As for who I am and how I feel, I just am. That's it. I wasn't born biologically female and I didn't grow up with those experiences, I can't claim them. I only know of what I experience myself firsthand and what I learn by shutting up and listening. I've always felt like I'm a guest in this house and that my place is to act like one. I'm not owed a key to the front door. 

As far as impact goes, being trans has definitely impacted parts of my life. There's no way that it couldn't. As for personality, I'll make self-deprecating jokes but that's it. I'm trans but it's just a part of who I am and not a defining factor. I dont feel a need or desire to bring it up in conversation if I can help it."

We have to face the facts that we don't live in a society that is made of nice women. We live in a society full of all kinds of abusers and I have not found that appeasement and doormatness is the most effective way to neutralize them.

To me, it doesn't make sense to argue in generalized way whether kindness is a weakness or not. My concerns are practical, my question is what will be effective in a given situation. As we've seen, appeasement to TiMs in the name of kindness has gotten us into a shitshow

Moreover, to me there is a big distinction between superficial kindness, and big picture kindness. You can be nice in the moment and reap the nicey-nice points and ultimately fail in your goal and get everyone into a really f***** up situation. Or you can be not so nice and make things better on a large scale. I prefer the latter and don't mind being the bad guy."

They were transsexual women. I didn't start to experience antagonism until recently when they started going nuts over pronouns, forcing themselves into women's spaces (sports, battered women's shelters etc.) and calling lesbians transphobic for not wanting to date them.

8030,"She does not and please trust that there is a reason for that. She communicates freely with me, her lawyers, her friends, her partners. But she has refrained from making too many public statements for legal reasons. 

This GFM that people are donating to was actually established in June or July, wayyyyy before her and I connected (which was only last week). She had tried to solicit some help on her own to raise money for her legal battle against Meredith's extreme arrears in child support (hence the name of the GFM, and the sworn affidavit in the GFM photo). 

When I came here today, it was after being so sad and distraught because Juniper was being threatened with defamation suits by Meredith for coming forward with her stories of abuse at Meredith's hands. These legal threats caused her to incur even more legal costs, which led to the awful situation I outlined in my original post. And then all of you lovely people came through with donations to that GFM that had been established long ago. 

But getting back to the original point: THATS why she doesn't often talk. It is because there is an undercurrent legal battle she is in. Not just this new one that has just cropped up, but the original one. 

IN MY OPINION (THIS IS MY OPINION NOT JUNIPER'S, I AM ONLY SPEAKING FOR MYSELF) her current lawyer (the one who is dealing with the child support case) does not seem that competent. I wish she had better legal counsel so she did not feel so scared to speak out and exercise her rights. I hope a feminist lawyer sees this and takes her case on. Wishful thinking, but I can pray."
8031,"I don‚Äôt normally use Reddit but have my own account and my own lawyer. Tris refers to the lawyer as ‚Äúour‚Äù lawyer meaning ‚Äúour‚Äù as a family, but I am his sole client on the case. I have free access to communicate as I please‚Äî Anna can vouch for that, since we‚Äôve been communicating frequently. 

I appreciate your concerns. I know it‚Äôs extremely common for people with a history of abuse to end up in the same patterns, but I am safe now. 

I agreed not to discuss my ex online anymore and I‚Äôm honestly very shaken and worried about harassment, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been pretty quiet."
8032,"They do, but considering they're the party listed in the case they're hesitant to say much, if anything, to give this creep any ammo. 

Plus our lawyer has asked them not to."
8033,Me.
8034,I've made an introductory comment of sorts on this post as to not hijack anyone's comment.
8035,"Oh, cool! Is there a revenge vigilante group too? One that's not full of MRAs?"
8036,Why does it say ‚Äúfeminist anarchist‚Äù by your handle? Doesn‚Äôt seem to fit in the least
8037,"You are absolutely not alone. :) 

Bullies don't win in this world. They will enjoy temporary victories which make them THINK they have gotten ahead, but as my Grandmother said -- Those who have bad intentions will always suffer the wound of their own arrow in the end."
8038,"Juniper signed up and provided context on her beliefs here, her username is u/likethetree8. I won't put words in her mouth. 

>The update I added to the GoFundMe where I described my relationship with radical feminism as ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù wasn‚Äôt intended to be a condemnation fo radical feminism, but the opposite. I‚Äôm in a weird position in that I struggle with gender dysphoria but I hold a lot of beliefs in common with gender-critical feminists. I was intending to express that, although I know that a lot of radfems are very untrusting of people like me, I‚Äôm never offended by anyone‚Äôs support or compassion, and I‚Äôd absolutely never dox or betray someone who helped me.
I hope my attempt to express gratitude and acknowledgement of the source of the donations didn‚Äôt end up alienating or offending anyone. I‚Äôm thankful for the help. And I need it now. Not just financially, but emotionally, mentally‚Äî I feel like I‚Äôve taken a huge, dangerous leap and have to trust that there are people who will catch me. Seeing a lot of people coming together for me has been awe-inspiring and has helped me keep some hope that things will be ok.

I will defer to user u/puppycasino, who put it best on this issue. I am surprised by the few folks on here who have denounced Juniper for not coming to terms with her trauma fast enough."

8040,I'll send an email. Would you want to make this a top level post or contact the mods or something?  not many people will see it at this point in the thread.
8041,"> Honestly surprised he didn't think ""Meredith"" wasn't girly enough for him. I know a lot people think it doesn't sound super feminine because it doesn't end with the ""e"" or ""a"" sound.

It's not even a name that's only used for girls. Sure, mainly it is, but it is a boys name as well, one prominent example being Meredith Willson who wrote 'The Music Man'."
8042,"My understanding is that they took it from one of their favorite porn actresses. 

Because of course they did."
8043,oh my god
8044,"I've held the same job for 19 years. The needs of our family are prioritized over anything else to the point that it frustrates Juniper that I don't buy myself things often. Our health insurance covers all but $10 of the cost of my 'titty skittles.'

I understand the concern though, 99% of trans women are like this. Hell, you described Meredith down to the letter. They literally described being forced to get a job to pay child support as being a human rights violation... in court."
8045,Wait wait wait. She‚Äôs married to another TiM?!? Wtf?
8046,[deleted]
8047,"She HAS to be nicey nice, though. The courts will eviscerate her if she so much as damns him with faint praise. It's already not enough."
8048,I can still hear the crickets chirping over on that side.
8049,"All of the things you just mentioned are things about the community that drive me insane. We shouldn't be forcing ourselves anywhere. I also think way too many creeps and fetishists get in and are protected in the name of 'wokeness.' 

Probably why I've been called a TERF so many times."
8050,I'm in /r/gendercritical. Most everyone here has a valid reason to loathe trans women. I don't blame anyone for being critical or suspicious of me.
8051,Now THAT is quality content
8052,Oh. My apologies. And I'm so sorry.

8055," It‚Äôs a difficult spot to be in, for sure. It wasn‚Äôt my message that this woman hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúgotten over her trauma fast enough ‚Äú, but more so a self protective act in this age of doxxing. I appreciate the extra context and will take that into consideration.  Women deserve support in times like this, and for those who can afford to risk their name being known, I think we should do everything that we can to provide support. I hope you will understand the necessity of my caution. I wish her well, and I thank you for writing."
8056,Sure! I have no idea how to use reddit lmfao
8057,"It is originally a masculine Welsh name meaning 'great lord' or 'sea lord'
Maredudd or Maredydd (in Welsh the 'dd' is a 'th' like sound."
8058,"You're exactly right, I was actually named after my grandmother and it was mostly a male coded name even that recently. She was the girl named ""Blake"" or ""Spencer"" of her day.

Kind of hilarious that less than a century later this dude is using it as his \~female\~ pseudonym."

8060,"Are you using women's facilities such as bathrooms and locker rooms? 

How is it that a working man who has held the same job for ""19 years"" and is partnered with another working adult, can't pay for the basic costs of living? Where has all your money gone the past 19 years that now we all need to support the 2 of you?

>The needs of our family are prioritized over anything else to the point that **it frustrates Juniper that I don't buy myself things often.**

So if she got a windfall from gofundme, she'd definitely want you to take a portion of our money and ""reward"" yourself with a girlie shopping spree."
8061,"Yes and he just replied to me above, claiming he has worked 19 years and spends every dime on their family, but somehow still broke."
8062,[removed]
8063,Yes. The creeps and fetishists are riding in on everyone's coattails and making transpeople and gay people look bad. That is the problem with self ID.
8064,I suppose I misspoke. He's Juniper's lawyer. I've just helped pay the bills.
8065,Gotcha
