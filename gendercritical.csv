@jk\_rowling Thank you for saying this. WE LOVE YOU ‚ö°Ô∏è [twitter](https://twitter.com/rGenderCritical/status/1208084151573725184)"
1,,RetlaOge,"Christ... the kind of shit people are replying you'd think she'd murdered an entire nursery of disabled kids or something.

It's twitter though, so no real surprise it's full of absolute clowns.

Apparently it's now *""cruel and primitive""* to understand that sex exists... Who the fuck are these people? How do they manage to function in the real world?"
2,,MrMojoRiseman,"The replies to the tweet are just incredible. All she said was don't fire a woman for saying biological sex is a thing, and people are saying that trans kids wouldn't be allowed in Hogwarts and that Rowling is a literal Death Eater üòÇ"
3,,GoshawkToday,"The fact that she put the hashtag #ThisIsNotADrill indicates she knows perfectly well what she is doing. ""This is Not a Drill"" is the title of an article, mentioned in another post in this sub, written by Kathleen Stock and subtitled ""I call upon UK academic philosophers and other academics to publicly demonstrate their disciplinary values."" Kathleen Stock is mentioned in Julie Bindel's recent article, ""Triumph of the Trans Lobbyists.""

I wonder if anyone else if putting up any #ThisIsNotADrill tweets."
4,,ComplicatedSpirit,"Digg.com's article on the issue said that J.K. Rowling is wrong because ""trans people have a right to exist"". Jesus fuck. Any time some random person doesn't give them what they want, it gets blown into some massive human tragedy on par with the worst violations of the right to live. 

NO ONE SAID TIP DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO EXIST. Fuck. Not buying into your ideology =/= believing you don't have the right to exist. 

It's like having someone refuse to convert to your religion and claiming that they want you dead because of it."
5,,remquarqk,"I still can't believe a CHARITY WORKER was fired. 

People in the biological, medical sciences say things like ""sex is immutable"" every single day. 

If I wasn't on this sub I don't think I would understand the level of pushback a statement like this would cause."
6,,Taveing,"This is fantastic! This must be difficult for her as she'll undoubtedly attract a lot of venom from some of her own supporters. Like Dumbledore says: ""It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.‚Äù"
7,,littlecandyapple,"As much as I love this, the replies are so bizarre. Guilt-tripping someone for acknowledging reality. I hope she doesn‚Äôt cave in and apologize to the TRA circlejerk."
8,,quasarbar,"SEX IS REAL.

What the actual fuck is going on when you're ""violating human rights"" by stating an objective scientific fact?"
9,,Beepus_Maleepus,"Ok today is the day. I've fucking peaked. Reading through the comments to her tweet has well and truly stuck the knife in. All my life I have suffered because I am female. I don't ""feel"" any way in particular, I *am* female. And I have suffered for it. From being raped at 7 to being abused by my ex boyfriend and everything in between. Now we are being told these experiences are imaginary and to suggest that our experiences are because of our BIOLOGICAL SEX is fucking transphobic!  I just can't anymore. This is insane, I am done."
10,,freshpicked12,Now THAT is a brave and stunning woman.
11,,UnableGiraffe3,"I'm not surprised! She might be filthy rich now but once upon a time she was the kind of woman who spent time in women's shelters. I speak from experience when I say middle class privilege makes it easy to chant transwomen are women because it doesn't even occur to ask questions like ""what if I was at a homeless shelter and my roommate was the Gamestop Ma'am? What if I were in prison and had to share a shower with Kate White?"""
12,,femaleisnotafeeling,"People are losing their damn minds in the replies. They love posting that photo of Emma Watson wearing the ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äùshirt, as if JKR is advocating for the hunt of trans people for sport."
13,,vageennpeenrgender,"I‚Äôm shook right now. I feel like I will never have the professional and personal security to be so bold.
Seeing JK be brave enough to STAND UP is amazing to me. HP was a big part of my childhood and family life."
14,,ThrowThrowBurritoABC,A few months ago several of my acquaintances went to local libraries and hid Rowling's books so patrons couldn't find them.   At least two refused to let their children read Harry Potter because they consider her a TERF.
15,,Calamity_loves_tacos,"So surprising (/s) how such a sound, non aggressive statement is met with loads of memes saying ""shut the fuck up terf"" with cutesy guns being pointed from the side shouting about being on ""the right side of history""."
16,,restlessyears,"Oh thank goodness. Well done JK. We need someone with her profile to stand up for women.

The replies and indirects about her tweet is absolutely INSANE.... all this whining and crying about ‚Äúhow will the trans kids feel seeing this‚Äù and all this... what?? Nobody should be so fragile and deluded that they cry at the MATERIAL REALITY that biological sex is a real thing. Like other commenters have said, people are making it seem as if she is some sort of mass murderer for acknowledging a basic fact that EVERYONE ACCEPTED up until recently."
17,,flapyourwings,"Oh damn, JK went IN!"
18,,sara7147,YES!!!  So glad a celebrity had the balls to stand up and SAY SOMETHING!!!
19,,cavesofsponge,"Thank you, J.K."
20,,modernmedusaa,"FANTASTIC NEWS!!

And this is why I love when poor women end up super rich but don't forget about their sisters- she is still in touch with her struggles as a single mother and the other underdogs thrown under the bus

Also writing fantasy novels for a living she probs has a lot to say about that LOLLLL

Glad JK was able to see the growing gravitas of this issue. This is actually huge given her level of fame!! Seems like she was flirting with it in the background but has now decided to go full throttle GC!!!"
21,,raddy-set-go,"I find it deeply disturbing that merely saying ""sex  is real"" is now front page news. I genuinely feel like I'm going crazy reading the responding tweets, like I've stepped into a parallel universe."
22,,accioupvotes,Oof. According to some of the comments this post is rising in /r/all. Prepare for the TRAs
23,,Saitschik,The comments under her tweet are a living proof that many transgenderpeople unfortunately have severe mental health issue. The way they are losing it is more than creepy and the way they threaten women for their agenda disgusting. Everybody supporting them supports a new form of misogyny. Plain and simple.
24,,sojourner_truth_,Yes!!!! I love to hear celebrities pushing back.
25,,2or3thingsIknow,The idiot trans loons who trashed her from a Like on a tweet caused their own issues. The more they screech and whine and ban and censor the more people push back. Of course she was going to be a terf. This is what happens when you are metaphorically and literally bullied by men. You push back.
26,,FlyinBananaPhone,The man who started all this with Maya referred to a feminist charity group as ‚Äúroasties‚Äù and said he hoped they got raped. Incel language.
27,,BasieSkanks,"Rowling didn‚Äôt even mention gender ideology, and the TRAs are losing their shit.  She only mentioned that biological sex is real. How can ANYONE with a functioning brain stem argue with that? The fact they are frothing at the mouth at a statement of objective true just shows how crazy this movement has become."
28,,mokebe_asfalit,Is woke twitter going to start comparing her to Voldemort now?
29,,Jo_in_TN,"This court ruling has emboldened cyclopath.  He is talking lawsuits and is wanting to contact major news publications.   

He really thinks he can sue every woman into shutting up, but will more likely begin a campaign of contacting employers of every woman who speaks out.   I have nothing to lose to this bully, but I fear for women in the U.K.

I can read his twitter account from my phone only (which I find difficult), since I'm been blocked on my computer.  :)"
30,,antediluvian5,"Came to this sub to see if anyone was talking about this! I saw ‚ÄúJK Rowling is a terf‚Äù trending and thought, ‚ÄúGood for her. I like her more now.‚Äù"
31,,RealMapelFlavour,"""Cool."" - Magdalen Berns"
32,,furious_doog,Watch them burn their Harry Potter books.
33,,moglbu,The replies to her tweet are all people claiming to be in tears and heartbroken. I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine being that affected by someone‚Äôs words.
34,,shapesofthesea,"I read the tweet and my first thought was, she‚Äôs not saying anything wrong. She‚Äôs acknowledging reality. The people angry about her comment are so deep in denial. I don‚Äôt get it."
35,,,[deleted]
36,,Jenjenhar,"So wonderful that JK is brave enough to stand up for common sense and women‚Äôs rights. A large number of her fans are crying about it. Looks like they still believe in fantasies.

Maya F is crowdfunding her legal fees. Unfortunately she has only hit ¬£85,000 so far. It‚Äôs against rules to link it but please please donate if you are able to."
37,,apfrun,"I cannot believe saying ""sex is real"" is such a massive issue. Also how is it even transphobic whatsoever? Even trans people fucking know they have a biological sex. This is all so ridiculous lol."
38,,,[deleted]
39,,BanksyGuy00018,"Just some minutes later you'll see hundreds of raging lib HP fans dissowning JK and talking trash about their fav franchise.
Maybe now they'll read another book"
40,,Ergative_Absolutive,Goddess bless her.
41,,yesisaiditxx,"I‚Äôm so amazed. I wish she‚Äôd know that despite all of the people who throw this to the erroneous extreme of, ‚ÄúShe hates trans people‚Äù and attack her accordingly, there are women out there like me who read that from such a distinguished person and felt that they could breathe a little more easily. I had really believed that no person of her caliber would ever do this‚Äî hell, I had even doubted that any were out there who didn‚Äôt buy in to the fantasy. Anyone who accuses her of hateful bigotry is living in their fragile imagination. She‚Äôs not calling for trans abuse in any way. She is simply speaking up for what she knows as true regarding justice and reality. 

People often tell the story of how she started Harry Potter, and I see that same determined woman in this tweet. Congratulations to J.K Rowling for living with integrity."
42,,gencritgenz,the like ratio is also really encouraging! way more likes than any of her recent tweets!!
43,,,Women continue to suffer while men don't. This is not fair and it is not right.
44,,knight_siegmeyer,"BEAUTIFUL. Thank you JK! I've always felt a little honoured to have a signed copy of The Goblet of Fire from her but now it's extra special ngl. 

I take back everything I said about the Crimes of Grindlewald being kinda bad. (But not the Cursed Child. I stand by my review of 'pretty show, not nearly as good as the actual books')"
45,,EquivalentApple,"Holy shit I hope JK Tweets about the Scottish GRA reform consultation. The fucking bastards have been trying to sneak it in below the radar like they always do. Coincidentally Wings over Scotland, the biggest Scottish GC Twitter account and the one with the widest reach, got banned the day they announced the consultation."
46,,Tonglentoo,Just got called a terf today over in Twitter for applauding her. üòè
47,,stompbixby,"maybe shes sick of literal hundreds of creeps arguing about 'girldick' in every fucking tweet she makes

it would bother me less if there werent actual tweets from children sandwiched between these fucking girldick tweets

god bless you jkr"
48,,,"The only negative consequence of this are the liberal think pieces that are going to flood youtube on why JK Rowling is cancelled and how ‚Äúwrong‚Äù she is. üòÇ

_All_ the people I follow who usually stick to pop culture and avoid politics, are going to have something to say about this. I‚Äôm tired already."
49,,spoopypigeon,finally
50,,Felix_Dzerjinsky,Holy shit TRA heads will explode.
51,,Fitncurly,I think I‚Äôll go out and buy the entire Harry Potter set just for this üòÜ.  Yessss!
52,,black_it_out,Hurrah!! I was so miserable this morning - the court ruling was outrageous. I now feel galvanised. Speaking out always makes a difference.
53,,sparklesailor,"She‚Äôs in a unique position in that she‚Äôs made her fortune and success and is no longer reliant on public opinion. We all know she‚Äôs had these opinions for a while but I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs finally being open and bold about it. The TRAs can cry and complain if they want, and call for a boycott of one of the world‚Äôs biggest and most beloved franchises, and it won‚Äôt make the slightest bit of difference."
54,,vitisrotundifolia,"If you listen closely, you can hear thousands peaking at once"
55,,Deleteordecay,"Really appreciate when influential people, especially women stand up to this bullshit. Maybe she can have a word with Emma Watson.

The replies are both sad and comical at the same time.

Edit: remember the outrage over a tweet she liked? She knew she was gonna catch hate for this but did it anyway. Good for her."
56,,,[deleted]
57,,maiarooberts,"Shout out to JK Rowling for taking a stand because this shit has been getting ridiculous. They're engaged and it's currently trending on Twitter. They even have ""JK Rowling is a TERF"" trending. LOL"
58,,Sasasamker,"Such a big deal. I have been trying to battle commenters on that post by explaining what the T-word means, who uses it, why the case was important, why it was so disappointing, why it's outrageous she lost her job, how sex cant change. 

The basics really. Same as in real life, gently gently explaining to people why this is harmful to women. 

If you arent already, would any of you mind joining in on Twitter and helping us look as reasonable as we are? The TRA's are out in force. Unfortunately for them, they've come out with the gun memes and manga characters and look, frankly, ridiculous."
59,,purrfekt,T\*RF is trending now on Twitter üôÑ
60,,whitelilyflower,"Good for her. The replies to her tweet are so pathetic, I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre at a point in time where stating basic facts about biology can get you crucified. Ridiculous."
61,,Lonely_Cartographer,She said how I feel exactly! I don't care if men want to dress like women or even call them women as long as they are not legally recognized as women and i don't get thrown in jail for calling them a man
62,,Aunpasoportucasa,Why is it wrong to understand there is a biological sex? People are completely overreacting. I see a lot of Harry Potter tattoo coverups in the near future.
63,,quack-snack,The number of people apparently reduced to a puddle of tears over this - a statement of biological fact and reality - makes me laugh.
64,,ShootTheMoon03,"Apparently Mark Hamill liked the tweet. I suspect a lot more prominent figures share the same views but don‚Äôt want to deal with the Twitter circus and ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù. Twitter really thinks they are the majority opinion because they start trending topics and try to cancel everyone when it‚Äôs really propelled by teenagers and college age kids trying to be woke and regurgitating they same mantras, such as‚Äùtranswomen are women‚Äù, without a clue of what they‚Äôre talking about . They can‚Äôt even define woman without circular logic or sexist stereotypes"
65,,Far-Air,She is wonderful and knows actual kindness‚Äî not TRA-‚Äòkindness‚Äô threatened into her. We need more people like her standing up for women.
66,,ATWTFRK,This is almost too good to be true!
67,,Sasofa,"They're gonna try and cancel her in every way possible.

Too bad cancel culture doesn't exist. I can think of very few people who have been ""cancelled"" on Twitter and had anly longterm negative impact on their career. All she has to do is not address it."
68,,FrenchieFrankenstein,I‚Äôm so glad
69,,lefromageetlesvers,"Never read the Harry Potter books, because i was too old when they came out, but i'm all in. I'm teaching philosophy, so maybe i can work her into on my syllabus. Great news!"
70,,purrfekt,"Well! Excuse me, while I cheer (silently at work)! üòç 

I'll remember this, when the famous skeptic dudebros come along and appropriate the resistance against TRA. The cowards."
71,,SadMadNomad,"Good for her. I know she's super rich and all, but it takes guts nowadays to speak common sense. She didn't say anything particularly controversial, yet we all know how simply acknowledging biological sex as a reality is considered ""transphobic.""

I enjoyed the Harry Potter books when I was a kid, but I never stuck around too long in the fandom. Every big fandom has its overzealous fans; the petty side of me wonders how libfem HP fans will handle this. Judging by the responses on Twitter, I'm sure they'll be oh so calm and open-minded, unlike evil transphobic JK Rowling...

Seriously though, I can't believe we live in a world where ""sex is real"" needs to be said and is considered offensive. I'm glad someone greatly influential like JK Rowling is speaking out.

Edit: I looked up more responses on Twitter and Tumblr, and I can't feel a smidgen of gleeful pettiness like I thought I could. The viciousness and heartbreak many people are showing is exhausting. Rowling said nothing hateful or prejudiced, yet people are treating her as if she's a supervillain on the levels of Voldemort."
72,,spin_the_globe,"Good for her. Never been a Harry Potter fan, but that may have to change."
73,,tr330fsn4rk,"Some idols never let you down.. 

This is absolutely wonderful! And she was so classy about it, too."
74,,rezkidsinlove,"Where's that David Tennant 10th Doctor 'GOOD OL' J.K.!!!!!!' gif????

(Also, presumably, The Tenth Doctor knew about all this, considering he's a Time Lord and all. The Doctor is a TERF, confirmed.)

I think I might wear my Gryffindor scarf today in solidarity."
75,,jadedjude,"I hope she stands her fucking ground.

One look at the replies and I wanna gag, I hate these people so fucking much. I'm not a rad fem so I find it ironic they call anyone a terf simply because we hate their bullshit.

I doubt JK is even a TERF, she's just peak trans and I'm glad she had the balls to speak her mind.

\#IStandwithJKR"
76,,Lesbian_Frylock,Finally. Saw this coming from all of her rabid genderkweer fans annoying her constantly. She was gonna crack eventually.
77,,why_cambrio,"Pleasantly surprised at the amount of support in the comments, even if it is intermittently placed in between memes that are LITERALLY calls to violence against ""t\*rfs"""
78,,raddy-set-go,"I've liked her tweet. That doesn't seem at all like a big deal but I'm becoming less afraid. Especially considering women (and some men like @glinner but let's face it mostly women) are actually paying with their livelihoods for stating the truth. It's the least I can do.

Edit: a number of people I know and follow have called J.K. Rowling an ""evil terf"" or something to that effect, saying they stand by ""those she has hurt with her transphobia""... And these are otherwise intelligent seeming people. I've not uttered a word of my own on the matter but I can't help feeling like I need to brace myself for some backlash soon."
79,,medusahisshiss,"I picture her reading the responses, laughing, surrounded by piles of money. I love it."
80,,trw365,"I feel so sorry for Maya that she is having to go through all of this, from her writing she seems to have a very clever and smart point of view about international tax policy, its a pity she isn't still in the job she loved but at the same time I am enjoying the sun shining through the overton window now that people are now discussing how batshit this all is."
81,,Shotgunshine__,"I‚Äôve been a Harry Potter fan since I was 8, and I thought that I couldn‚Äôt love her more. She has officially proven me wrong! I‚Äôm so glad that she‚Äôs using her massive platform to say what the rest of us are thinking."
82,,LeishaCamden,I was SO HAPPY when I saw this on Twitter earlier today. This is a big deal.
83,,DownWithPorn,Well done Rowling! Looks like my country is leading the way in resisting this trans bullshit.
84,,antikvariaatti,I'm proud of her.
85,,brownclown96,Yes!!! Queen Rowling. It is so valuable to have people in her position who cannot be silenced by firing or intimidation to speak out on behalf of women. I‚Äôm so happy she‚Äôs done this
86,,hobbittoisengard,Things like these shows the true qualities of the trans movement. Ignorance and rudeness.
87,,vierkeervijf,Well done Joanne! The TRAs are going crazy and showing their true nature to an even wider audience now!
88,,arnaq,Fuck yes! Ily JK Rowling! Come visit us at this sub :)
89,,NoctaeBride,What a fucking queen. Unironically.
90,,InASeaOfReality,My favorite part is the trans activists comparing her to characters from her own book
91,,PollyannaPenny,"I'm so glad she finally came out of the Gender Critical closet officially. We need women like Rowling in our corner because not only is she a beloved figure, she's so rich that she doesn't have to worry about her income being slashed or becoming financially destitute as a result of being ""cancelled"". So she can say things that many other women WANT to say but can't because they can't afford to lose their careers and reputations.

&#x200B;

TRAs can call her ""Hitler"" and ""TERF"" all they like. She'll still be collecting those sweet Harry Potter royalty checks!"
92,,astheykissconsume,"""Joanne Andrea,""¬†I said quietly, ""you were named for two censored feminists. One of them was called a TERF and she was probably¬†the bravest woman I ever knew."""
93,,writerlylesbian,"Hilariously, I remember back in the early 2000s when it was the religious right who were banning Harry Potter books for being full of the devil's work. Now the Left have met them on the other side of the horseshoe and are banning the books too!"
94,,mossmalachite,"In a FB group that‚Äôs something like, ‚Äúliking harry potter isn‚Äôt a personality trait‚Äù where people post like over the top HP themed weddings and people naming their kids Albus, and they‚Äôre absolutely going off about how transphobic it is and all the ‚ÄúAS A WOMAN WITH A PENIS I AM SO SAD TO KNOW I WOULDNT BE ALLOWED AT HOGWARTS‚Äù and I had to come here and read logical reactions to regain my sanity"
95,,glitteristheanswer,"Original tweet was awesome and she clearly knows what shes doing! If I didnt work in games and animation I'd retweet with a million confetti horn emojis! Really depressing to see my entire timeline filled with people I look up to in my field or consider intelligent equals saying ""if you're a terf you can go die"" and just repeating ""trans rights are human rights"" 

No they're fucking not frankly, they're exceptional not standard. Human rights (for women,for minority groups, for disabled people) are rights and protections you CANT CHANGE. If you change your mind on your gender WELL LOOK AT THAT YOU CHANGED AND IT MEANS ITS SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY THAT ISNT IMMUTABLE. That makes any request for those rights or protections exceptional, a luxury,NOT a requirement"
96,,tgrewy,"A beautiful peak trans end to a decade of madness.   
Hi r/all please read links in the sidebar and also visit r/itsafetish or r/actuallynotlesbians for more great content."
97,,LucyWColitisGoesBy,"> Trans folks have an extraordinary high suicide rate... can we just let them have the identity they want please? They're not doing anyone any harm. Leave them alone. 

Some of these people are so full of shit it's coming out of their ears. The fact that mentally ill men kill themselves is not our problem. Why the fucking hell should all the women of the world have to agree that a woman is a identity for a mentally ill man to have? 

As for not doing any harm that's a laugh. This woman is being fired for stating they're not women. Rowling is being called horrible names for standing at her side. How about they leave us alone?"
98,,milpathecat,I am so happy and just came here to say I love all women of Gender Critical and especially the mods and veterans for doing the hard work for years!!!! You absolute stars!
99,,UterusUnderground,"Honestly, seeing what feels like the entire female nerd establishment coming for Rowling‚Äôs neck makes me feel so hopeless. It‚Äôs so hard to be reminded that women that I once felt so much kinship with are caught up in this misogynist ideology almost to a fault. I saw Siobhan Thomas tweet that Rowling was a bitch who should retire, and it just broke my heart. Mara Wilson, Noelle Stevenson, Kate Beaton... I know that these women are libfems, they have to be to get anywhere in the nerd establishment, but it‚Äôs still disheartening to be reminded of how intolerant and extremist the whole scene has become. Or maybe it always was? I think I finally understand what the gamergaters meant when they said they wanted politics out of nerd media (even if I otherwise think they were a bunch of fools).  

I am so glad Christmas is happening and I at least won‚Äôt be seeing my irl nerd friends until this has hopefully calmed down a bit, because I‚Äôm sure they would talk about it and I just can‚Äôt deal with that. I just want to agree to disagree and move on to talking about Godzilla."
100,,OCPEoireitum,"I was raised to think that accusations of thoughtcrime, crimethink, and wrongthink were worse than the blasphemy they sought to punish. FYI I am a man (adult human male) - and suspect that we both read, interpret and take lessons from Orwell in exactly the same way. 

That was a very scary judgment.....and the decision, to use a legal term - seems ‚Äòperverse‚Äô indeed."
101,,slushpilot,"From the BBC article:

>""It is a core component of her belief that she will refer to a person  by the sex she considered appropriate even if it violates their dignity  and/or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or  offensive environment,"" he continued.  
>  
>""The approach is not worthy of respect in a democratic society.""

So, calling things as you see them is not allowed in a democratic society? Have we no freedom to think as individuals anymore? What makes such a society *democratic,* then?"
102,,BoringDisorder,"People are acting like she said transpeople don't deserve rights or respect. She literally just said that a woman should not lose her job for acknowledging biological sex. You can't change it. Maybe one day that technology will exist, but it doesn't currently. That's like someone saying ""believe what you want, but don't fire someone for saying the earth isn't flat"" and it causing huge outrage. Hard sciences exist and we shouldn't cover our ears and act like theory is more viable. 

She probably knew there'd be a lot of backlash and posted the tweet anyways. Proud of her."
103,,Amareldys,Someone rich and famous finally stood up for women! JK Rowling if you read this board... I LOVE YOU!
104,,Amphibiava,"I loved *Harry Potter* so much as a kid and adolescent (and I still have a lot of nostalgia for it now), and JK hasn't let me down üòä"

107,,Nickels4Tickles,The Twitter mob tantrums are so damn funny. Can't wait to piss off the woke crowd just by being a HP character for Halloween next year.
108,,pixipod,"The amount of people losing their shit over someone saying bio sex is real is.....wow. I honestly can't believe this is reality.

112,,anchovycupcakes,"I read some tweets, and one of them is like, I grew up reading your books and loved Harry Potter. What have I done to you? Why do you hate me and people like me?

Who the fuck said she hates you? You're just not a woman. FFS.

I knew what it would be like, but the pile on she's experiencing now is just incredible.

Thankfully, she has lots of money and I don't think she gives a fuck."

That said, I figured JK was GC, but the Maya Forstater situation must have peaked her enough to actually come out with it."
122,,chinpropped,"I get more and more radical feminist as a pushback to all this shit. I have no problem at all with transgender and fully support them IN THEIR OWN SPACES.

They deserve to have their own space. Women deserve our own space, free of being shut up and shut out by biological men."

125,,SometimesJacka,"One thing that‚Äôs fascinating is watching people not involved in these ideologies tip-toe around the drama.

126,,ZombieSazza,"In Scotland the number 3 trending hashtag is ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äù, number 5 being ‚ÄúI Stand With Maya Forstater‚Äù.

So twitter is at war of trans folk losing their shit and shouting ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äù, gender critical folk pointing out ‚Äúbut women‚Äôs rights aren‚Äôt trans rights‚Äù, lots of threats towards Rowling, lots of folk speaking out in favour of Rowling including gender critical Scottish MP Joan McAlpine and Blair White, and several trans folk supporting Rowling as well (sadly being drowned out), basically a bit of a war zone.

Vast majority of Scottish folk I‚Äôve seen online support what Rowling has said.

Maya Lost her job for being gender critical, and folk are trying to claim she was horrible etc, but she was calm, makes sense, is defending women‚Äôs rights, and trans folk are screaming over the top of everyone, including Amnesty International,

Yesterday, a UK court upheld this woman's firing, claiming that her statement that people could not change sex was incoherent and incompatible with a democratic society.

Am I the only one who is disappointed by the sheer number of women in 2019 who have allowed themselves to be silenced on this issue?

This is how it happens!

I will lose a job in a hot minute for something like this but then again I had a tough upbringing & am really not with the bullshit. Also my value lies outside of capitalism and its demands so I really do not give a shit about some poncey woke male telling me to swing my hook bc I made a man in fishnets uncomfortable. I just think about the Nazi's to remind myself of the importance of speaking up for morality against the madness of crowds. So often people make out like they are trapped in their job- no you have trapped yourself in that job...the world is very big and there's plenty of employers who won't force you to believe biological sex is a lie. Way more than you think in fact...or worse comes to worse work at home/online for an agency. Work for yourself and cut out the woke middle man. Connect with your sisters, I'm sure at least one knows a position going or a lawyer of some kind. Don't allow them to make you feel fearful and trapped

Damn...it was only 30 years ago marital rape was legal...wake up women! We aren't as safe as you think! Our rights need constant defence in the numbers! Think of the bigger picture!

I hear a lot of women talking a big feminist empowerment game nowadays but when it comes to supporting their sisters in difficult situations and saying SEX IS REAL they are somehow easily swayed into silence or the 'ummm ermmm I don't know'?

GET A GRIP WOMEN!!!! We need you to be stronger if we are to ever gain a real footing on this planet!!!"

He then dressed up in her clothes and was presumably going to live in her home and ""take over her life"" according to his manifesto.

Doesn't that just make ya feel the \~sisterhood\~ with TIMs?

They definitely are infatuated with womanhood to the point of violence, probably even more often than the average man, which is really saying something.

So basically, you might be able to argue these tropes are rooted from a anti-semitic/racist/sexist place, but modern writers aren't consciously using them for those specific implications.

Now the menz are jealous of this and they want in, but only once they've lived a full life of male privilege and had a midlife crisis. They have to infiltrate everything

I'm sorry but in 2019 I'm kinda cringed out by the sheer number of women who have allowed someone to convince them biological sex isn't real& to give up the rights of other women without any solid evidence whatsoever to confirm this. I mean its not a complicated thing- biological sex is MATERIALLY evident- it takes some passivity to believe its not. Its one thing to know its bs and not speak out of fear...but its another entirely to actually buy into behind closed doors & be part of its manifestation throwing other women under the bus for some woke SJW points for a tiny mentally unstable minority. I think the latter set of women need to have an even stronger word with themselves than the former. As in they clearly need to learn to have humility/ assertiveness. Some of these women had to be told 28874329 examples of why this is a bad idea for them to finally get it- I think that signals ignorance.

I don't want to hear your feminist views if you're all fluff when it comes to defending our boundaries. Thats just lip service- and we need more action. We need more women that put their foot down when they're say they're going to

I never bought it- I remember the first time I got put in the hot seat for my views in a room full of lib fem students who already despised me for not being a hipster....and the minute I spoke up they fell silent and the trans lecturer called me transphobic...but you could tell on their faces they wanted to nod and agree. They were just scared.. & I thought WTF? Are we back in the 50s??? Whats the point having access to education/ right to vote if women aren't going to use their voices???!

I couldn't NOT say anything because it sounded so bullshit...and was being taught to people in higher education- I immediately wanted to debate what he was saying. It was like a lecturer claiming the earth is flat to a bunch of naive paying students

All for asking what happens to womens boundaries if we allow men to say they're women...that was my crime

Expressions of hatred toward someone on account of that person's colour, race, disability, nationality (including citizenship), ethnic or national origin, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation is forbidden.) - quoting wikipedia here - and the police will come and investigate. Even if what you said doesn't reach the standard of hate speech, the fact that you've been questioned by the police is officially recorded. Did you notice which category is NOT covered by this law?"

Male medical professionals & investors? Absolutely nothing left wing about this deep down

Yes I agree the authorities are serious cowards- they have been infiltrated by political ideology & people are fast waking up to this BS. I think they can smell the lawsuits coming

This is why I have always been suspicious of people who are quick to defend 'authority' on that basis alone...if a doctor told you poison was good for you, would you believe it? I'm sure there's some arrogant gullible people who would & would readily argue with you about YOUR arrogance lmao

To me this just signals something off is happening with British healthcare- they have been selling bits off to private healthcare firms for some time. I truly believe one motivation for them doing this is to overwhelm the NHS with trans patients thus pushing it further into desperation that can only be 'saved' through more privatisation (I mean seriously- its costs MONEY to dish out these hormone blockers/medical transitions/mediate lifelong effects). And I believe this even more so because trans culture is very established/widespread in America where for profit healthcare is already the same  (they NEED customers= ¬£¬£¬£¬£). With free healthcare there is incentive to keep people well as that drains the government less & keeps costs down. Thus to me, this signals Britain's NHS moving towards a for profit structure.

And ofc the icing on the cake is that they can erode womens hard fought boundaries that they resent allowing us have (to a degree). Can't have equality if you can't tell who's who!!

I really feel with this Brexit malarkey (which is going to dint the UK economy longterm anyway) this is their perfect chance to slide it in under the carpet. There will be a lot of hoo har though bc the UK is very protective over the NHS

Yeah exactly! People overlook this aspect when I mention it as if its a conspiracy but its really not. The NHS has been struggling for some time due to forced austerity since the financial crash etc...and quite frankly the NHS could do WITHOUT a huge influx of trans kids and all their complications adding to the bill. I mean the trans journey is quite a long & costly experience...and the government funded NHS has to foot the bill for taht.
