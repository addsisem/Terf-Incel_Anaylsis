@jk\_rowling Thank you for saying this. WE LOVE YOU ‚ö°Ô∏è [twitter](https://twitter.com/rGenderCritical/status/1208084151573725184)"
1,RetlaOge,"Christ... the kind of shit people are replying you'd think she'd murdered an entire nursery of disabled kids or something.

It's twitter though, so no real surprise it's full of absolute clowns.

Apparently it's now *""cruel and primitive""* to understand that sex exists... Who the fuck are these people? How do they manage to function in the real world?"
2,MrMojoRiseman,"The replies to the tweet are just incredible. All she said was don't fire a woman for saying biological sex is a thing, and people are saying that trans kids wouldn't be allowed in Hogwarts and that Rowling is a literal Death Eater üòÇ"
3,GoshawkToday,"The fact that she put the hashtag #ThisIsNotADrill indicates she knows perfectly well what she is doing. ""This is Not a Drill"" is the title of an article, mentioned in another post in this sub, written by Kathleen Stock and subtitled ""I call upon UK academic philosophers and other academics to publicly demonstrate their disciplinary values."" Kathleen Stock is mentioned in Julie Bindel's recent article, ""Triumph of the Trans Lobbyists.""

I wonder if anyone else if putting up any #ThisIsNotADrill tweets."
4,ComplicatedSpirit,"Digg.com's article on the issue said that J.K. Rowling is wrong because ""trans people have a right to exist"". Jesus fuck. Any time some random person doesn't give them what they want, it gets blown into some massive human tragedy on par with the worst violations of the right to live. 

NO ONE SAID TIP DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO EXIST. Fuck. Not buying into your ideology =/= believing you don't have the right to exist. 

It's like having someone refuse to convert to your religion and claiming that they want you dead because of it."
5,remquarqk,"I still can't believe a CHARITY WORKER was fired. 

People in the biological, medical sciences say things like ""sex is immutable"" every single day. 

If I wasn't on this sub I don't think I would understand the level of pushback a statement like this would cause."
6,Taveing,"This is fantastic! This must be difficult for her as she'll undoubtedly attract a lot of venom from some of her own supporters. Like Dumbledore says: ""It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.‚Äù"
7,littlecandyapple,"As much as I love this, the replies are so bizarre. Guilt-tripping someone for acknowledging reality. I hope she doesn‚Äôt cave in and apologize to the TRA circlejerk."
8,quasarbar,"SEX IS REAL.

What the actual fuck is going on when you're ""violating human rights"" by stating an objective scientific fact?"
9,Beepus_Maleepus,"Ok today is the day. I've fucking peaked. Reading through the comments to her tweet has well and truly stuck the knife in. All my life I have suffered because I am female. I don't ""feel"" any way in particular, I *am* female. And I have suffered for it. From being raped at 7 to being abused by my ex boyfriend and everything in between. Now we are being told these experiences are imaginary and to suggest that our experiences are because of our BIOLOGICAL SEX is fucking transphobic!  I just can't anymore. This is insane, I am done."
10,freshpicked12,Now THAT is a brave and stunning woman.
11,UnableGiraffe3,"I'm not surprised! She might be filthy rich now but once upon a time she was the kind of woman who spent time in women's shelters. I speak from experience when I say middle class privilege makes it easy to chant transwomen are women because it doesn't even occur to ask questions like ""what if I was at a homeless shelter and my roommate was the Gamestop Ma'am? What if I were in prison and had to share a shower with Kate White?"""
12,femaleisnotafeeling,"People are losing their damn minds in the replies. They love posting that photo of Emma Watson wearing the ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äùshirt, as if JKR is advocating for the hunt of trans people for sport."
13,vageennpeenrgender,"I‚Äôm shook right now. I feel like I will never have the professional and personal security to be so bold.
Seeing JK be brave enough to STAND UP is amazing to me. HP was a big part of my childhood and family life."
14,ThrowThrowBurritoABC,A few months ago several of my acquaintances went to local libraries and hid Rowling's books so patrons couldn't find them.   At least two refused to let their children read Harry Potter because they consider her a TERF.
15,Calamity_loves_tacos,"So surprising (/s) how such a sound, non aggressive statement is met with loads of memes saying ""shut the fuck up terf"" with cutesy guns being pointed from the side shouting about being on ""the right side of history""."
16,restlessyears,"Oh thank goodness. Well done JK. We need someone with her profile to stand up for women.

The replies and indirects about her tweet is absolutely INSANE.... all this whining and crying about ‚Äúhow will the trans kids feel seeing this‚Äù and all this... what?? Nobody should be so fragile and deluded that they cry at the MATERIAL REALITY that biological sex is a real thing. Like other commenters have said, people are making it seem as if she is some sort of mass murderer for acknowledging a basic fact that EVERYONE ACCEPTED up until recently."
17,flapyourwings,"Oh damn, JK went IN!"
18,sara7147,YES!!!  So glad a celebrity had the balls to stand up and SAY SOMETHING!!!
19,cavesofsponge,"Thank you, J.K."
20,modernmedusaa,"FANTASTIC NEWS!!

And this is why I love when poor women end up super rich but don't forget about their sisters- she is still in touch with her struggles as a single mother and the other underdogs thrown under the bus

Also writing fantasy novels for a living she probs has a lot to say about that LOLLLL

Glad JK was able to see the growing gravitas of this issue. This is actually huge given her level of fame!! Seems like she was flirting with it in the background but has now decided to go full throttle GC!!!"
21,raddy-set-go,"I find it deeply disturbing that merely saying ""sex  is real"" is now front page news. I genuinely feel like I'm going crazy reading the responding tweets, like I've stepped into a parallel universe."
22,accioupvotes,Oof. According to some of the comments this post is rising in /r/all. Prepare for the TRAs
23,Saitschik,The comments under her tweet are a living proof that many transgenderpeople unfortunately have severe mental health issue. The way they are losing it is more than creepy and the way they threaten women for their agenda disgusting. Everybody supporting them supports a new form of misogyny. Plain and simple.
24,sojourner_truth_,Yes!!!! I love to hear celebrities pushing back.
25,2or3thingsIknow,The idiot trans loons who trashed her from a Like on a tweet caused their own issues. The more they screech and whine and ban and censor the more people push back. Of course she was going to be a terf. This is what happens when you are metaphorically and literally bullied by men. You push back.
26,FlyinBananaPhone,The man who started all this with Maya referred to a feminist charity group as ‚Äúroasties‚Äù and said he hoped they got raped. Incel language.
27,BasieSkanks,"Rowling didn‚Äôt even mention gender ideology, and the TRAs are losing their shit.  She only mentioned that biological sex is real. How can ANYONE with a functioning brain stem argue with that? The fact they are frothing at the mouth at a statement of objective true just shows how crazy this movement has become."
28,mokebe_asfalit,Is woke twitter going to start comparing her to Voldemort now?
29,Jo_in_TN,"This court ruling has emboldened cyclopath.  He is talking lawsuits and is wanting to contact major news publications.   

He really thinks he can sue every woman into shutting up, but will more likely begin a campaign of contacting employers of every woman who speaks out.   I have nothing to lose to this bully, but I fear for women in the U.K.

I can read his twitter account from my phone only (which I find difficult), since I'm been blocked on my computer.  :)"
30,antediluvian5,"Came to this sub to see if anyone was talking about this! I saw ‚ÄúJK Rowling is a terf‚Äù trending and thought, ‚ÄúGood for her. I like her more now.‚Äù"
31,RealMapelFlavour,"""Cool."" - Magdalen Berns"
32,furious_doog,Watch them burn their Harry Potter books.
33,moglbu,The replies to her tweet are all people claiming to be in tears and heartbroken. I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine being that affected by someone‚Äôs words.
34,shapesofthesea,"I read the tweet and my first thought was, she‚Äôs not saying anything wrong. She‚Äôs acknowledging reality. The people angry about her comment are so deep in denial. I don‚Äôt get it."
35,,[deleted]
36,Jenjenhar,"So wonderful that JK is brave enough to stand up for common sense and women‚Äôs rights. A large number of her fans are crying about it. Looks like they still believe in fantasies.

Maya F is crowdfunding her legal fees. Unfortunately she has only hit ¬£85,000 so far. It‚Äôs against rules to link it but please please donate if you are able to."
37,apfrun,"I cannot believe saying ""sex is real"" is such a massive issue. Also how is it even transphobic whatsoever? Even trans people fucking know they have a biological sex. This is all so ridiculous lol."
38,,[deleted]
39,BanksyGuy00018,"Just some minutes later you'll see hundreds of raging lib HP fans dissowning JK and talking trash about their fav franchise.
Maybe now they'll read another book"
40,Ergative_Absolutive,Goddess bless her.
41,yesisaiditxx,"I‚Äôm so amazed. I wish she‚Äôd know that despite all of the people who throw this to the erroneous extreme of, ‚ÄúShe hates trans people‚Äù and attack her accordingly, there are women out there like me who read that from such a distinguished person and felt that they could breathe a little more easily. I had really believed that no person of her caliber would ever do this‚Äî hell, I had even doubted that any were out there who didn‚Äôt buy in to the fantasy. Anyone who accuses her of hateful bigotry is living in their fragile imagination. She‚Äôs not calling for trans abuse in any way. She is simply speaking up for what she knows as true regarding justice and reality. 

People often tell the story of how she started Harry Potter, and I see that same determined woman in this tweet. Congratulations to J.K Rowling for living with integrity."
42,gencritgenz,the like ratio is also really encouraging! way more likes than any of her recent tweets!!
43,,Women continue to suffer while men don't. This is not fair and it is not right.
44,knight_siegmeyer,"BEAUTIFUL. Thank you JK! I've always felt a little honoured to have a signed copy of The Goblet of Fire from her but now it's extra special ngl. 

I take back everything I said about the Crimes of Grindlewald being kinda bad. (But not the Cursed Child. I stand by my review of 'pretty show, not nearly as good as the actual books')"
45,EquivalentApple,"Holy shit I hope JK Tweets about the Scottish GRA reform consultation. The fucking bastards have been trying to sneak it in below the radar like they always do. Coincidentally Wings over Scotland, the biggest Scottish GC Twitter account and the one with the widest reach, got banned the day they announced the consultation."
46,Tonglentoo,Just got called a terf today over in Twitter for applauding her. üòè
47,stompbixby,"maybe shes sick of literal hundreds of creeps arguing about 'girldick' in every fucking tweet she makes

it would bother me less if there werent actual tweets from children sandwiched between these fucking girldick tweets

god bless you jkr"
48,,"The only negative consequence of this are the liberal think pieces that are going to flood youtube on why JK Rowling is cancelled and how ‚Äúwrong‚Äù she is. üòÇ

_All_ the people I follow who usually stick to pop culture and avoid politics, are going to have something to say about this. I‚Äôm tired already."
49,spoopypigeon,finally
50,Felix_Dzerjinsky,Holy shit TRA heads will explode.
51,Fitncurly,I think I‚Äôll go out and buy the entire Harry Potter set just for this üòÜ.  Yessss!
52,black_it_out,Hurrah!! I was so miserable this morning - the court ruling was outrageous. I now feel galvanised. Speaking out always makes a difference.
53,sparklesailor,"She‚Äôs in a unique position in that she‚Äôs made her fortune and success and is no longer reliant on public opinion. We all know she‚Äôs had these opinions for a while but I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs finally being open and bold about it. The TRAs can cry and complain if they want, and call for a boycott of one of the world‚Äôs biggest and most beloved franchises, and it won‚Äôt make the slightest bit of difference."
54,vitisrotundifolia,"If you listen closely, you can hear thousands peaking at once"
55,Deleteordecay,"Really appreciate when influential people, especially women stand up to this bullshit. Maybe she can have a word with Emma Watson.

The replies are both sad and comical at the same time.

Edit: remember the outrage over a tweet she liked? She knew she was gonna catch hate for this but did it anyway. Good for her."
56,,[deleted]
57,maiarooberts,"Shout out to JK Rowling for taking a stand because this shit has been getting ridiculous. They're engaged and it's currently trending on Twitter. They even have ""JK Rowling is a TERF"" trending. LOL"
58,Sasasamker,"Such a big deal. I have been trying to battle commenters on that post by explaining what the T-word means, who uses it, why the case was important, why it was so disappointing, why it's outrageous she lost her job, how sex cant change. 

The basics really. Same as in real life, gently gently explaining to people why this is harmful to women. 

If you arent already, would any of you mind joining in on Twitter and helping us look as reasonable as we are? The TRA's are out in force. Unfortunately for them, they've come out with the gun memes and manga characters and look, frankly, ridiculous."
59,purrfekt,T\*RF is trending now on Twitter üôÑ
60,whitelilyflower,"Good for her. The replies to her tweet are so pathetic, I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre at a point in time where stating basic facts about biology can get you crucified. Ridiculous."
61,Lonely_Cartographer,She said how I feel exactly! I don't care if men want to dress like women or even call them women as long as they are not legally recognized as women and i don't get thrown in jail for calling them a man
62,Aunpasoportucasa,Why is it wrong to understand there is a biological sex? People are completely overreacting. I see a lot of Harry Potter tattoo coverups in the near future.
63,quack-snack,The number of people apparently reduced to a puddle of tears over this - a statement of biological fact and reality - makes me laugh.
64,ShootTheMoon03,"Apparently Mark Hamill liked the tweet. I suspect a lot more prominent figures share the same views but don‚Äôt want to deal with the Twitter circus and ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù. Twitter really thinks they are the majority opinion because they start trending topics and try to cancel everyone when it‚Äôs really propelled by teenagers and college age kids trying to be woke and regurgitating they same mantras, such as‚Äùtranswomen are women‚Äù, without a clue of what they‚Äôre talking about . They can‚Äôt even define woman without circular logic or sexist stereotypes"
65,Far-Air,She is wonderful and knows actual kindness‚Äî not TRA-‚Äòkindness‚Äô threatened into her. We need more people like her standing up for women.
66,ATWTFRK,This is almost too good to be true!
67,Sasofa,"They're gonna try and cancel her in every way possible.

Too bad cancel culture doesn't exist. I can think of very few people who have been ""cancelled"" on Twitter and had anly longterm negative impact on their career. All she has to do is not address it."
68,FrenchieFrankenstein,I‚Äôm so glad
69,lefromageetlesvers,"Never read the Harry Potter books, because i was too old when they came out, but i'm all in. I'm teaching philosophy, so maybe i can work her into on my syllabus. Great news!"
70,purrfekt,"Well! Excuse me, while I cheer (silently at work)! üòç 

I'll remember this, when the famous skeptic dudebros come along and appropriate the resistance against TRA. The cowards."
71,SadMadNomad,"Good for her. I know she's super rich and all, but it takes guts nowadays to speak common sense. She didn't say anything particularly controversial, yet we all know how simply acknowledging biological sex as a reality is considered ""transphobic.""

I enjoyed the Harry Potter books when I was a kid, but I never stuck around too long in the fandom. Every big fandom has its overzealous fans; the petty side of me wonders how libfem HP fans will handle this. Judging by the responses on Twitter, I'm sure they'll be oh so calm and open-minded, unlike evil transphobic JK Rowling...

Seriously though, I can't believe we live in a world where ""sex is real"" needs to be said and is considered offensive. I'm glad someone greatly influential like JK Rowling is speaking out.

Edit: I looked up more responses on Twitter and Tumblr, and I can't feel a smidgen of gleeful pettiness like I thought I could. The viciousness and heartbreak many people are showing is exhausting. Rowling said nothing hateful or prejudiced, yet people are treating her as if she's a supervillain on the levels of Voldemort."
72,spin_the_globe,"Good for her. Never been a Harry Potter fan, but that may have to change."
73,tr330fsn4rk,"Some idols never let you down.. 

This is absolutely wonderful! And she was so classy about it, too."
74,rezkidsinlove,"Where's that David Tennant 10th Doctor 'GOOD OL' J.K.!!!!!!' gif????

(Also, presumably, The Tenth Doctor knew about all this, considering he's a Time Lord and all. The Doctor is a TERF, confirmed.)

I think I might wear my Gryffindor scarf today in solidarity."
75,jadedjude,"I hope she stands her fucking ground.

One look at the replies and I wanna gag, I hate these people so fucking much. I'm not a rad fem so I find it ironic they call anyone a terf simply because we hate their bullshit.

I doubt JK is even a TERF, she's just peak trans and I'm glad she had the balls to speak her mind.

\#IStandwithJKR"
76,Lesbian_Frylock,Finally. Saw this coming from all of her rabid genderkweer fans annoying her constantly. She was gonna crack eventually.
77,why_cambrio,"Pleasantly surprised at the amount of support in the comments, even if it is intermittently placed in between memes that are LITERALLY calls to violence against ""t\*rfs"""
78,raddy-set-go,"I've liked her tweet. That doesn't seem at all like a big deal but I'm becoming less afraid. Especially considering women (and some men like @glinner but let's face it mostly women) are actually paying with their livelihoods for stating the truth. It's the least I can do.

Edit: a number of people I know and follow have called J.K. Rowling an ""evil terf"" or something to that effect, saying they stand by ""those she has hurt with her transphobia""... And these are otherwise intelligent seeming people. I've not uttered a word of my own on the matter but I can't help feeling like I need to brace myself for some backlash soon."
79,medusahisshiss,"I picture her reading the responses, laughing, surrounded by piles of money. I love it."
80,trw365,"I feel so sorry for Maya that she is having to go through all of this, from her writing she seems to have a very clever and smart point of view about international tax policy, its a pity she isn't still in the job she loved but at the same time I am enjoying the sun shining through the overton window now that people are now discussing how batshit this all is."
81,Shotgunshine__,"I‚Äôve been a Harry Potter fan since I was 8, and I thought that I couldn‚Äôt love her more. She has officially proven me wrong! I‚Äôm so glad that she‚Äôs using her massive platform to say what the rest of us are thinking."
82,LeishaCamden,I was SO HAPPY when I saw this on Twitter earlier today. This is a big deal.
83,DownWithPorn,Well done Rowling! Looks like my country is leading the way in resisting this trans bullshit.
84,antikvariaatti,I'm proud of her.
85,brownclown96,Yes!!! Queen Rowling. It is so valuable to have people in her position who cannot be silenced by firing or intimidation to speak out on behalf of women. I‚Äôm so happy she‚Äôs done this
86,hobbittoisengard,Things like these shows the true qualities of the trans movement. Ignorance and rudeness.
87,vierkeervijf,Well done Joanne! The TRAs are going crazy and showing their true nature to an even wider audience now!
88,arnaq,Fuck yes! Ily JK Rowling! Come visit us at this sub :)
89,NoctaeBride,What a fucking queen. Unironically.
90,InASeaOfReality,My favorite part is the trans activists comparing her to characters from her own book
91,PollyannaPenny,"I'm so glad she finally came out of the Gender Critical closet officially. We need women like Rowling in our corner because not only is she a beloved figure, she's so rich that she doesn't have to worry about her income being slashed or becoming financially destitute as a result of being ""cancelled"". So she can say things that many other women WANT to say but can't because they can't afford to lose their careers and reputations.

&#x200B;

TRAs can call her ""Hitler"" and ""TERF"" all they like. She'll still be collecting those sweet Harry Potter royalty checks!"
92,astheykissconsume,"""Joanne Andrea,""¬†I said quietly, ""you were named for two censored feminists. One of them was called a TERF and she was probably¬†the bravest woman I ever knew."""
93,writerlylesbian,"Hilariously, I remember back in the early 2000s when it was the religious right who were banning Harry Potter books for being full of the devil's work. Now the Left have met them on the other side of the horseshoe and are banning the books too!"
94,mossmalachite,"In a FB group that‚Äôs something like, ‚Äúliking harry potter isn‚Äôt a personality trait‚Äù where people post like over the top HP themed weddings and people naming their kids Albus, and they‚Äôre absolutely going off about how transphobic it is and all the ‚ÄúAS A WOMAN WITH A PENIS I AM SO SAD TO KNOW I WOULDNT BE ALLOWED AT HOGWARTS‚Äù and I had to come here and read logical reactions to regain my sanity"
95,glitteristheanswer,"Original tweet was awesome and she clearly knows what shes doing! If I didnt work in games and animation I'd retweet with a million confetti horn emojis! Really depressing to see my entire timeline filled with people I look up to in my field or consider intelligent equals saying ""if you're a terf you can go die"" and just repeating ""trans rights are human rights"" 

No they're fucking not frankly, they're exceptional not standard. Human rights (for women,for minority groups, for disabled people) are rights and protections you CANT CHANGE. If you change your mind on your gender WELL LOOK AT THAT YOU CHANGED AND IT MEANS ITS SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY THAT ISNT IMMUTABLE. That makes any request for those rights or protections exceptional, a luxury,NOT a requirement"
96,tgrewy,"A beautiful peak trans end to a decade of madness.   
Hi r/all please read links in the sidebar and also visit r/itsafetish or r/actuallynotlesbians for more great content."
97,LucyWColitisGoesBy,"> Trans folks have an extraordinary high suicide rate... can we just let them have the identity they want please? They're not doing anyone any harm. Leave them alone. 

Some of these people are so full of shit it's coming out of their ears. The fact that mentally ill men kill themselves is not our problem. Why the fucking hell should all the women of the world have to agree that a woman is a identity for a mentally ill man to have? 

As for not doing any harm that's a laugh. This woman is being fired for stating they're not women. Rowling is being called horrible names for standing at her side. How about they leave us alone?"
98,milpathecat,I am so happy and just came here to say I love all women of Gender Critical and especially the mods and veterans for doing the hard work for years!!!! You absolute stars!
99,UterusUnderground,"Honestly, seeing what feels like the entire female nerd establishment coming for Rowling‚Äôs neck makes me feel so hopeless. It‚Äôs so hard to be reminded that women that I once felt so much kinship with are caught up in this misogynist ideology almost to a fault. I saw Siobhan Thomas tweet that Rowling was a bitch who should retire, and it just broke my heart. Mara Wilson, Noelle Stevenson, Kate Beaton... I know that these women are libfems, they have to be to get anywhere in the nerd establishment, but it‚Äôs still disheartening to be reminded of how intolerant and extremist the whole scene has become. Or maybe it always was? I think I finally understand what the gamergaters meant when they said they wanted politics out of nerd media (even if I otherwise think they were a bunch of fools).  

I am so glad Christmas is happening and I at least won‚Äôt be seeing my irl nerd friends until this has hopefully calmed down a bit, because I‚Äôm sure they would talk about it and I just can‚Äôt deal with that. I just want to agree to disagree and move on to talking about Godzilla."
100,OCPEoireitum,"I was raised to think that accusations of thoughtcrime, crimethink, and wrongthink were worse than the blasphemy they sought to punish. FYI I am a man (adult human male) - and suspect that we both read, interpret and take lessons from Orwell in exactly the same way. 

That was a very scary judgment.....and the decision, to use a legal term - seems ‚Äòperverse‚Äô indeed."
101,slushpilot,"From the BBC article:

>""It is a core component of her belief that she will refer to a person  by the sex she considered appropriate even if it violates their dignity  and/or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or  offensive environment,"" he continued.  
>  
>""The approach is not worthy of respect in a democratic society.""

So, calling things as you see them is not allowed in a democratic society? Have we no freedom to think as individuals anymore? What makes such a society *democratic,* then?"
102,BoringDisorder,"People are acting like she said transpeople don't deserve rights or respect. She literally just said that a woman should not lose her job for acknowledging biological sex. You can't change it. Maybe one day that technology will exist, but it doesn't currently. That's like someone saying ""believe what you want, but don't fire someone for saying the earth isn't flat"" and it causing huge outrage. Hard sciences exist and we shouldn't cover our ears and act like theory is more viable. 

She probably knew there'd be a lot of backlash and posted the tweet anyways. Proud of her."
103,Amareldys,Someone rich and famous finally stood up for women! JK Rowling if you read this board... I LOVE YOU!
104,Amphibiava,"I loved *Harry Potter* so much as a kid and adolescent (and I still have a lot of nostalgia for it now), and JK hasn't let me down üòä"
105,_ad-meliora_,I'm so proud of her
106,carpetplaydohx2,GOOD FOR HER!!!!!!!!!!
107,Nickels4Tickles,The Twitter mob tantrums are so damn funny. Can't wait to piss off the woke crowd just by being a HP character for Halloween next year.
108,pixipod,"The amount of people losing their shit over someone saying bio sex is real is.....wow. I honestly can't believe this is reality. 

Also reading everything going down on twitter, the cult like aspects of transgender ideology are really apparent."

112,anchovycupcakes,"I read some tweets, and one of them is like, I grew up reading your books and loved Harry Potter. What have I done to you? Why do you hate me and people like me?

Who the fuck said she hates you? You're just not a woman. FFS.

I knew what it would be like, but the pile on she's experiencing now is just incredible.

Thankfully, she has lots of money and I don't think she gives a fuck."

114,TheOGJammies,"I really fucking love this woman more and more everyday. Let me get my coins together and go buy the Harry Potter box set for people for Christmas, brb."

121,exkinksterthrowaway,"Yaaaaaasssss!  She's one of us!

  
That said, I figured JK was GC, but the Maya Forstater situation must have peaked her enough to actually come out with it."
122,chinpropped,"I get more and more radical feminist as a pushback to all this shit. I have no problem at all with transgender and fully support them IN THEIR OWN SPACES.
But we women are constantly being asked to make room for those who did not grow up female and who make everything into uterus-havers and pregnant people.
They deserve to have their own space. Women deserve our own space, free of being shut up and shut out by biological men."

125,SometimesJacka,"One thing that‚Äôs fascinating is watching people not involved in these ideologies tip-toe around the drama. 

So many people being like ‚Äú*obviously* this isn‚Äôt about saying you can change your sex. *Obviously* you can‚Äôt *actually* change your sex. This is about gender and *identity*.‚Äú

126,ZombieSazza,"In Scotland the number 3 trending hashtag is ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äù, number 5 being ‚ÄúI Stand With Maya Forstater‚Äù.

So twitter is at war of trans folk losing their shit and shouting ‚Äútrans rights are human rights‚Äù, gender critical folk pointing out ‚Äúbut women‚Äôs rights aren‚Äôt trans rights‚Äù, lots of threats towards Rowling, lots of folk speaking out in favour of Rowling including gender critical Scottish MP Joan McAlpine and Blair White, and several trans folk supporting Rowling as well (sadly being drowned out), basically a bit of a war zone.

Vast majority of Scottish folk I‚Äôve seen online support what Rowling has said.

Maya Lost her job for being gender critical, and folk are trying to claim she was horrible etc, but she was calm, makes sense, is defending women‚Äôs rights, and trans folk are screaming over the top of everyone, including Amnesty International,

>Why should she even apologize? What she said was 100% fact. Lopping off your manhood or attaching one to yourself doesn't magically change your DNA. You still have the same XX or XY chromosomes and are still biologically whatever gender you were born as.

284,womenopausal,"Oddly enough, that particular episode was written by the Who writer who got his chapter canned from a book, because another writer in the collection said he was transphobic.

Everywhere where biological sex was considered the defining factor is now being harnessed to gender."
302,Ergative_Absolutive,"In the UK, a woman who tweeted that biological sex could not be changed was fired by her employer. (Note that she wasn't accused of not using trans people's prefered names or pronouns, and in fact explicitly said that she would do so out of courtesy; it was simply her stated position that men are male, women are female, and the pretense that one can become the other is nothing more than a legal fiction.) Yesterday, a UK court upheld this woman's firing, claiming that her statement that people could not change sex was incoherent and incompatible with a democratic society. JKR is coming out in support of the fired woman, and by extension the many UK feminists who question the wisdom of overwriting sex with gender identity in UK law."

Somehow the solution there isn't to get them proper help, oh no, it's to totally abandon all logic in favour of pandering to their delusion.

I‚Äôm Jewish, and upon first reading the books as a kid thought it was funny how many Jewish stereotypes the goblins embodied; greed, small-stature, cleverness, long noses,financial wiles, insularity, etc. Tho I don‚Äôt think JKR is anti-Semitic by any means, I do think she very likely drew on a certain trope without consciously recognizing that such a trope was historically assigned to Jews...and she probably should have been a bit more careful not to do that lol

321,Far-Air,"While I agree, I don't see the point of the discussion going there since JK Rowling didn't do anything actually wrong. She doesn't think sex can actually be changed-- aka, she subscribes to reality."

I grew up reading the Alex Rider and Diamond Brother Series by Anthony Horowitz. They‚Äôre still my favourite teen books today, even though Horowitz has made some questionable remarks about having a black James Bond

The woke activists try to push for cancelling EVERYTHING a person has ever done if they say anything even vaguely ""problematic"". And they seem to think that, if you can look past the author's questionable statements and just enjoy their art, you are somehow agreeing with and/or validating everything they have ever said or done."

Am I the only one who is disappointed by the sheer number of women in 2019 who have allowed themselves to be silenced on this issue?

This is how it happens!

I will lose a job in a hot minute for something like this but then again I had a tough upbringing & am really not with the bullshit. Also my value lies outside of capitalism and its demands so I really do not give a shit about some poncey woke male telling me to swing my hook bc I made a man in fishnets uncomfortable. I just think about the Nazi's to remind myself of the importance of speaking up for morality against the madness of crowds. So often people make out like they are trapped in their job- no you have trapped yourself in that job...the world is very big and there's plenty of employers who won't force you to believe biological sex is a lie. Way more than you think in fact...or worse comes to worse work at home/online for an agency. Work for yourself and cut out the woke middle man. Connect with your sisters, I'm sure at least one knows a position going or a lawyer of some kind. Don't allow them to make you feel fearful and trapped

Damn...it was only 30 years ago marital rape was legal...wake up women! We aren't as safe as you think! Our rights need constant defence in the numbers! Think of the bigger picture!

I hear a lot of women talking a big feminist empowerment game nowadays but when it comes to supporting their sisters in difficult situations and saying SEX IS REAL they are somehow easily swayed into silence or the 'ummm ermmm I don't know'?

Doesn't that just make ya feel the \~sisterhood\~ with TIMs?

They definitely are infatuated with womanhood to the point of violence, probably even more often than the average man, which is really saying something.

Now the menz are jealous of this and they want in, but only once they've lived a full life of male privilege and had a midlife crisis. They have to infiltrate everything

I'm sorry but in 2019 I'm kinda cringed out by the sheer number of women who have allowed someone to convince them biological sex isn't real& to give up the rights of other women without any solid evidence whatsoever to confirm this. I mean its not a complicated thing- biological sex is MATERIALLY evident- it takes some passivity to believe its not. Its one thing to know its bs and not speak out of fear...but its another entirely to actually buy into behind closed doors & be part of its manifestation throwing other women under the bus for some woke SJW points for a tiny mentally unstable minority. I think the latter set of women need to have an even stronger word with themselves than the former. As in they clearly need to learn to have humility/ assertiveness. Some of these women had to be told 28874329 examples of why this is a bad idea for them to finally get it- I think that signals ignorance.

I don't want to hear your feminist views if you're all fluff when it comes to defending our boundaries. Thats just lip service- and we need more action. We need more women that put their foot down when they're say they're going to

I never bought it- I remember the first time I got put in the hot seat for my views in a room full of lib fem students who already despised me for not being a hipster....and the minute I spoke up they fell silent and the trans lecturer called me transphobic...but you could tell on their faces they wanted to nod and agree. They were just scared.. & I thought WTF? Are we back in the 50s??? Whats the point having access to education/ right to vote if women aren't going to use their voices???!

I couldn't NOT say anything because it sounded so bullshit...and was being taught to people in higher education- I immediately wanted to debate what he was saying. It was like a lecturer claiming the earth is flat to a bunch of naive paying students

All for asking what happens to womens boundaries if we allow men to say they're women...that was my crime

Male medical professionals & investors? Absolutely nothing left wing about this deep down

Yes I agree the authorities are serious cowards- they have been infiltrated by political ideology & people are fast waking up to this BS. I think they can smell the lawsuits coming

This is why I have always been suspicious of people who are quick to defend 'authority' on that basis alone...if a doctor told you poison was good for you, would you believe it? I'm sure there's some arrogant gullible people who would & would readily argue with you about YOUR arrogance lmao

To me this just signals something off is happening with British healthcare- they have been selling bits off to private healthcare firms for some time. I truly believe one motivation for them doing this is to overwhelm the NHS with trans patients thus pushing it further into desperation that can only be 'saved' through more privatisation (I mean seriously- its costs MONEY to dish out these hormone blockers/medical transitions/mediate lifelong effects). And I believe this even more so because trans culture is very established/widespread in America where for profit healthcare is already the same  (they NEED customers= ¬£¬£¬£¬£). With free healthcare there is incentive to keep people well as that drains the government less & keeps costs down. Thus to me, this signals Britain's NHS moving towards a for profit structure.

And ofc the icing on the cake is that they can erode womens hard fought boundaries that they resent allowing us have (to a degree). Can't have equality if you can't tell who's who!!

I really feel with this Brexit malarkey (which is going to dint the UK economy longterm anyway) this is their perfect chance to slide it in under the carpet. There will be a lot of hoo har though bc the UK is very protective over the NHS

Yeah exactly! People overlook this aspect when I mention it as if its a conspiracy but its really not. The NHS has been struggling for some time due to forced austerity since the financial crash etc...and quite frankly the NHS could do WITHOUT a huge influx of trans kids and all their complications adding to the bill. I mean the trans journey is quite a long & costly experience...and the government funded NHS has to foot the bill for taht.

If anyone is curious why TIMs insist on entering womens sports even though everyone can see they have an unfair advantage, in order for a sex change to be 100% and never mentioned again legally, they need to be included as women for sporting events. TIMs being banned from female sporting events would mean their actual sex would always have to be a matter of record. So they will fight this one to the death. It's probably going to be one of the things that sink in the court of public opinion because it's obvious even to the average sports fan a TIM has an unfair advantage over women.

You'll also notice the article avoids the fact that recent research is showing they maintain male muscle strength even after T blockers, and TIMs are two SD large than females. Which means an average size TIM has at least a 2SD head start in terms of strength on plain old Jane. This means only about only about 1/40 women is as strong or stronger as the average TIM.

EDIT: just realised a some of you won't know what 'SD' means. It's [standard deviation](http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) and it's referring to a distribution curve. The average man is 6 inches taller than the average woman. [Image to help you visualise what this means in terms of groups.](https://tall.life/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/New-height-distribution-with-legend.jpg) About one man in three is 6ft or over, and about 1% of women.

>	‚ÄúMale-to-female transgenders are not allowed to compete as females in our static strength sports as it is a direct competitive advantage,‚Äù wrote USAPL Therapeutic Use Exemptions Committee Chair Kristopher Hunt in an email to Cooper.

>	Hunt followed up with Cooper in January with this explanation:

>‚ÄúTransgender male to female individuals having gone through male puberty confer an unfair competitive advantage over non-transgender females due to increased bone density and muscle mass from pubertal exposure to testosterone.‚Äù

>	The ‚Äúbone density‚Äù red herring has been thrown out there for years, at least since MMA fighter Fallon Fox appeared on the scene. The bone density of black women is, on average, significantly higher than that of white women. In fact, some studies have shown the bone strength of black women to be higher than that of white men.


>	Yet we don‚Äôt see any great rush to divide lifting categories by race (which of course would be ridiculous), proving this bone-density argument to be nothing but a canard designed to specifically target trans athletes.

>	Still, USA Powerlifting‚Äôs ban on transgender women competing as women is in place.

>‚ÄúUSA Powerlifting is not a fit for every athlete and for every medical condition or situation,‚Äù the organization said in a statement. ‚ÄúSimply, not all powerlifters are eligible to compete in USA Powerlifting.‚Äù

>	USA Powerlifting did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

>	The organization‚Äôs ban has forced Cooper to look for other opportunities to compete, landing her at events hosted by the U.S. Powerlifting Association. The USPA is smaller and holds fewer events in Cooper‚Äôs home state. But she‚Äôs happy to be able to compete.


>‚ÄúThey allow trans people to compete in their untested division,‚Äù Cooper said. ‚ÄúI won their Minnesota State Championship and it was amazing, but it still felt off knowing that I was denied eligibility for USA Powerlifting.‚Äù

614,VictoireHuguette,"Yes! Thank you for saying this. Clearly their idea of race is just as archaic as their conception of gender. As far as I am aware, biologically speaking, there is only one human race, and there are only two humans sexes. The fact there are some physical similarities between people of the same ethnical background doesn't mean there is a clear biological or genetical way of classifying people into the social ""races"" we know. It would be impossible to make racial categories in sport, since there would be no way of knowing who belongs where. There is however a pretty easy way of classifying people into the two human sexes. But they are trying so hard to forget about it, they seem to think the only clue we might have is their bone density."

Edit:   Here is another chart from NCBI:

638,WillTheMadnessEnd,"Yes over years.  It depends like everything on how strong your bones were at its peak in young adulthood...

Weightlifters would have a much higher bone density than if they didn't do that sport  Lifting weights is recommended to build bone mass.  Comparing a man who transitioned recently, and a weightlifter at that,  to the senior transgenders in general is misleading and a red herring as usual.

Not sure if bone density as much to do as muscle and upper body strength, in weightlifting anyway.

Edit:

Also, after menopause, it is loss of 'estrogen' a that makes women susceptible to menopause.  Most probably it is the loss of testosterone in TIMs that make them susceptible.  It's quite complicated, but bone would lose density gradually over years, and I am wondering if the estrogen they take offsets the loss to a some degree."

There are genetic differences in different populations of people. These differences exist in hair type, skull shape and population genetics. Scientists can examine  skeletonized remains and determine what population of people they came from. They wouldn't be able to do that if humans weren't genetically different. How can anyone look at a European, an Eastern Asian and a person native to Sub Saharan Africa and not see that they are different genetically? And this difference goes way beyond just skin color."

649,CybergothiChe,"pack heat, shoot meat"
650,not_mean_enough,Great advice for getting arrested in most countries.
651,goblinf,"oh sorry. I didn't mean actual identity cards. I meant (in the UK) where when you become a client of say a solicitor you have to show them that you have existed for a long time, and they have to google you to check you don't fall into particular categories. So if someone has a name change, like say a Lord coming into an inheritance, they provide birth cert with birth name, then deed poll to current title, because the other documents will have the original name until the deed poll, then the new name afterwards. The system is created to cope with there being a change of name.  
Similarly if you are a woman and get married and take your husband's name, except there you provide the marriage certificate.

There's a continuity of ID.

Whereas withthe self ID legislation (that's just been kicked into the long grass here in the UK) there's an assumption that there's a prior 'dead name' that won't ever be used again. And the new name. Well that's just NOT feasible in a society that, for example, has antimoney laundering rules to protect against terrorism and crime. The protection has a higher public good than the attempt to stop dead naming.

Not sure that's any clearer. But basically, if you change your name, your old name/existence follows you. As Freddie the seahorse has found - the court said only women can give birth to kids, therefore your current name is on the birth certificate, under the mother box not the father box. The law is interested in what's going to make sense in society for the long term - not magical thinking currently in vogue.

We don't actually have ID cards in teh UK, it was mooted but there was such an outcry it didn't happen. Which is fine, until you don't have a passport or a driving licence, then since 9/11 and the changes in ID verification rules, doing anything official becomes a nightmare...."
652,villanelle23eve,"Still, it would be more fair to have an asian women's basketball team, for instance. It does seem like a racial advantage when one group is on average so much taller than the other."

654,xvmeadar,"Yeah, but then density is resultant from factors like activity and perhsps diet, not necessarily from race. I found a bit of issue with the ‚Äúblack women have higher bone density than white men‚Äù. There recently was a scandal when it was found that many doctors erroneously believed that black people have thicker skin than whites, and treated accordingly. 

Does testosterone or oestrogen contribute to higher bone density or lack thereof?"
655,,"Yep, it absolutely does"
656,,"That‚Äôs what kills me. Whenever the TRA‚Äôs rage about this shit, they‚Äôll point to one single factor and claim that it varies amongst women. And, yeah, these things *do* vary. Some women have a lower q-angle, other women are really tall, whatever. But the TRA‚Äôs choose not to acknowledge (and the uninformed general public seems to not fully understand) that it‚Äôs the *multiple, compounding* physiological differences between males and females that ultimately confers the advantage and warrants the ban."

659,VictoireHuguette,"Well good luck classifying people into these categories then. I can already see it ""this is a competition for 30% Irish 70% sub-saharian people only, sorry but you don't fit the pre requirements"". 
Of course there are genetic differences between ethnicities, there are even genetic differences between blonde people and red heads, and that doesn't make it a race.

~~For many years, until the big blow-up last week, actuallesbians linked [this post](https://archive.is/iO8AP) on the sidebar.~~ Actually, they took it down briefly, but it's back up; this shit is *still* the official policy of bring/AL. The author of the post concedes that no one *has* to date transwomen, but makes it clear that if you don't date transwomen, it reflects poorly on your character:

>You aren't into penii *[sic]*. I get it, and for what it's worth neither am I. To be fair, many trans women who carry that particular anatomical burden are not big fans of it either, so you have that in common at least. But many trans women don't, and many of those who do won't for long. **Be careful about using this biased sample to rule out all trans women.**

>Also, **would you rule someone out because she had six toes?** Whenever I hear a straight man ask how sex works in the absence of a penis, I feel sorry for his girlfriends/wife, because he clearly doesn't understand how sexytimes work; **when I hear a lesbian rule out trans women because of the presence of a hidden penis I feel sorry for her partner, because how superficial is that?**

So yeah. There is actually immense, ubiquitous pressure on lesbians to be open to dating transwomen, and you clearly don't know what the fuck you're talking about."

Orgasm in the postoperative transsexual.

Lief HI, et al. Arch Sex Behav. 1993.

Abstract

The dearth of information regarding organism [sic] in postoperative transsexuals prompted the authors to study its prevalence. The sample consisted of 14 male-to-female (M-F) and 9 female-to-male (F-M) postoperative transsexuals. The relationship of orgasm to sexual and general satisfaction was explored via a specially designed questionnaire. Orgastic capacity declined in the M-F group and increased in the (F-M) group. Despite the decrease in orgasm in the M-F group, satisfaction with sex and general satisfaction with the results of surgery were high in both groups. General satisfaction of 86% replicates other studies. Frequency of sex increased by 75% in the M-F group and by 100% in the F-M group. A phalloplasty does not appear to be a critical factor in orgasm or in sexual satisfaction. The general conclusion is reached that it is possible to change one's body image and sexual identity and be sexually satisfied despite inadequate sexual functioning."
772,amselmama,I think they try and attach the neophallus somewhat to the clitoris and I know Balian Bushbaum has talked about 'having sex as a man' but I honestly can't imagine it working

795,Max-1995,"There‚Äôs a minority of people without dysphoria wearing the label ‚Äútrans‚Äù as a get out of jail free card. Those are the ones who are (generally, there‚Äôs bound to be some dysphoric people too) demanding sex from lesbians and suggesting that not liking penis is ‚Äúgynophilia‚Äù- a perverse attraction to female genitalia as opposed to the female sex- and that lesbians should re-examine that. 

If you don‚Äôt see why that‚Äôs a problem, you‚Äôre blind. Lesbians have to overcome compulsory heterosexuality, and imagine overcoming the hardest hurdle to accepting who you are, and then someone from inside your own house (lgbt community) says what sounds like the exact same thing. Here‚Äôs a helpful script. 

SOCIETY: You have to like dick, sleep with men. 

LESBIAN: I‚Äôve tried to overcome it but I just don‚Äôt like dick, I quite like women, actually. I think I‚Äôll date women from now on. 

LGBT COMMUNITY: You like women? That‚Äôs great. These women have dicks and you have to be open to sleeping with them because they are more vulnerable than you and women can have dicks. 

LESBIAN: Actually I just like vulva. I don‚Äôt want to be involved with a dick. 

LGBT COMMUNITY: WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU‚ÄôRE SAYING? You can‚Äôt say that!! There‚Äôs plenty of ways to have sex without PIV penetration, you know! 

And just real quick? Most of us have experienced this phenomenon. So I don‚Äôt understand where you get off, thinking you can come into our place and tell us how our experiences work. We have conversations here. We don‚Äôt just TELL each other how things are, that‚Äôs it, no other opinions."

Also, get the fuck out of our space. We don‚Äôt need a brainwashed fool who‚Äôs drank the ‚Äúfeels > reals‚Äù koolaid so hard to mansplain to us that our experiences didn‚Äôt happen and the misogyny/rape culture prominent within the TIM community doesn‚Äôt exist."

802,crittimes,"Sure, many trans people may be more comfortable with their sexuality after transition and therefore more responsive and open. TIFs are taking testosterone which will boost sex drive and with nerves retained from clitoris, which is twice as enervated as penis, it makes physiological sense that TIFs are more sexually satisfied post surgery. I wish it were less sexually rewarding in terms of social consequences but at least I understand transitioning more, given this information. 

The bright point of what I read was that some TIMs will only masturbate rather than seek out sexual partners, due to the complexity of their genital situation. I honestly do feel badly for them but am relieved that the conflict of having TIMs pushing for sexual acceptance in lesbian social spaces may be lessened by some TIMs choosing to take things into their own hands.

They distinguish it from a ‚Äúbrozilian‚Äù or ‚Äúmanzilian‚Äù, which is the removal of all hair in this region from a person with a scrotum. Ms. Yaniv strongly objects to these terms on the basis that she is a woman and not a ‚Äúbro‚Äù or a ‚Äúman‚Äù.

Whilst I'm glad that these women won, the way they won seems a dangerous precedent as it states that it's specifically because he wanted a genital wax rather than an arm or leg wax that they were right to refuse him.

913,salt_and_tea,Their expert is spot on. This is actually something that was covered in my cosmetology school instruction and we were informed that if we were not comfortable we were not obligated to learn to do it because it is difficult to do and the risk of creeps is high. Just in case anyone is questioning this quote and whether this shit is really that common.
914,TAgurl,"I used to wax both men and women. Every man who had genital waxing got an erection. 100%. Most were embarrassed about it and really apologetic, and there are ways as a professional to mitigate it (such as draping). You also typically have the man assist whilst you wax (to hold the skin taut - think scrotal skin); to have them ‚Äòhandle‚Äô their junk when it‚Äôs erect. 

Mostly, getting an erection was an automatic response to being touched. They do not last long, especially once the pain starts (don‚Äôt want it to seem as if men have them the entire appointment). 

It was not uncommon for a man to try to request more, or to suss out whether you‚Äôd offer more. Usually they tried to be subtle about it (they weren‚Äôt), but some outright asked, or just started talking sexually. They never tried this at the beginning of the appointment, all asked whilst well into the waxing. 

I once had an old guy start commenting on how he loved hot wax dripped on his balls. 

Some men outright begged you to ‚Äòfinish them off‚Äô, and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs always the creepy, feral men. I had many extremely attractive men hint or blatantly ask for sexual services. You have to presume that many of these men were partnered.

Didn‚Äôt matter whether the salon was highly reputable, or a suburban corner shop, both ends of the spectrum experienced unwanted sexual conduct from men. 

Unfortunately, if you‚Äôre going to offer intimate waxing for men you must have policies in place to handle these situations as they WILL occur."
915,quasarbar,">estheticians who are not trained in male genital waxing should not attempt to wax a penis and scrotum due to the risk of serious injury to the customer

920,anchovycupcakes,Yanniv is such an absolute piece of shit.
921,Bob177,Keep in mind that this was just *one* of the businesses Yaniv went after.  He pulled this scam at a dozen other places - working the system and suing people for not waxing his genitals was a business for him.

930,PollyannaPenny,"Whenever I bring the Yaniv story up to TRAs and their handmaidens, they either say, *""but he's not REALLY trans""* or *""you can't judge all trans-women based on one bad person! You wouldn't judge all women because one female did something evil, would you!?""*

&#x200B;

They don't seem to understand that the trans inclusive laws they champion are exactly what empowered Yaniv to use the Canadian government to punish immigrant women for the ""crime"" of refusing to touch his genitals. And that he used the Protected Class status of trans-women to evade punishment/judgement for doing shit that would have landed anyone else in jail. It doesn't matter if 99% of TiMs are saints. The point still stands that these laws empower shady men to do exactly what Yaniv did; and that problem needs to be acknowledged and addressed.

Yaniv is only catching heat for this because his Lady LARP is so cartoonishly pervy and gross that even hardcore activists like Morgane Oger had to publicly distance themselves from him. Can you imagine how many AGPs are pulling similar shit and we're just not hearing about it because those other men aren't total morons who broadcast every creepy thing they do like Yaniv does?"
931,PollyannaPenny,"> If not for Yaniv's abhorrent behaviour, it looks like the tribunal would have found against those two women.

This is a ***VERY*** good point. 

I honestly believe that the only reason Yaniv lost this case was because he's a cartoonishly creepy freak who broadcasted his intentions to screw over immigrant women, blatantly lied in court, has a documented history of sexually predatory behavior, attracted international attention/embarrassment with his antics, and basically embodies every negative stereotype of an AGP we can think of.

If Yaniv wasn't a total moron who left receipts of his bad behavior all over the internet; he probably would have won this case."
932,swspecial,It was his racism and him getting permanently documented on places like the farms that sunk him. Not so much the sexism underlying his behavior. And that makes me uncomfortable.
933,,"However, /r/Tranada was pretty quick to remove my link to this article"
934,BettySueMcCormick,"only kind of. it‚Äôs because Yaniv is just so mind-bogglingly bad at his hobby of harassing women and girls (and also, it appears, because of the use of clear language in defining certain services). if he had the barest hint of skill at dissembling or covering his tracks, we‚Äôd be reading a different decision.

this should stand as a sort of caution sign, I think. *attention: you ladies got lucky.* next time, there will be a skilled and sympathetic manipulator. no one will have thought they needed to specify who they meant (or itemize body parts) when they said ‚Äúwomen.‚Äù they‚Äôll learn that ignorance of the new language, which they didn‚Äôt even realize they were speaking, is no excuse."

I think it's less clear in federal human rights law though and the 'trend' is to protect gender ID above all else including race and religion so even if sex is explicitly written into BC human rights law it doesn't mean sex-based rights will actually be protected.   


Then again the HRT has an agenda but the actual supreme court of BC is less likely to put up with this kind of silliness since they need to act more like a real court and Yaniv would've been found in contempt of court a long time ago if it weren't the HRT."

956,girl_undone,">I feel like it‚Äôs not yet okay for any form of trans people to fully accept their identities. Society still wants them to live within norms.

>How was this ever a question?  
>  
>When  did we get to a point that someone had to actually decide that a person  could not be compelled to touch someone else's genitals?

Yaniv was able to do this because he claimed genital waxing was necessary ""gender affirming care"". So these salon workers were literally killing his inner woman by refusing to give him a ""lady wax"". 

&#x200B;

Never mind the fact that the VAST majority of actual females never get a genital wax (so it's not needed for any dude's Lady LARP). And never mind the fact that these workers typically have the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason such as hygiene, rude behavior, etc. If a man in a dress wants a cosmetic service, suddenly it becomes as vital as cancer treatment and anyone who refuses to do it is a monster."

Frankly I don't really know much about what has happened here. But I will say that there seems to be, and have been for some years now, increasing resistance to the idea that absolutely anything can be imposed upon a third party due to nothing more than self_identification.

I think this yaniv person has other issues as well, but maybe it was good that someone so blatantly over the top actually got told to sit the fuck down and stop imposing their personal insanity on their community.

Forcing a business owner to allow transwomen into the women's bathroom is actively forcing them to accept the belief that a transwoman is a biological woman or other similar beliefs that you may not agree with.

1064,isoxx,"the supreme court ruling was extremely limited. it primarily ruled on whether the previous court had given an unbiased judgement, and used statements made by the court that suggested they had discriminated against the bakery on basis of religion.

some of the justices did pen secondary opinions that a custom wedding cake is a form of art - since you have to design it - and thus, forcing the bakers to create art celebrating a gay marriage was coercing them to express something they did not believe in. it's been a while since i read the case, so i don't remember all the details, but i believe the bakery offered to sell them a premade wedding cake instead of a custom one, further delineating between 'refusing service' and 'refusing to create art.'"

Eventually, after having to take it to the US supreme court. But in this situation, both the Colorado courts and the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (CCRC) most certainly attempted to impose requirements on another group. Both the initial ruling and the appeal in Colorado was in favor of the plaintiffs. From the wiki article:

 *The case was decided in favor of the plaintiffs; the cake shop was ordered not only to provide cakes to same-sex marriages, but to ""change its company policies, provide 'comprehensive staff training' regarding public accommodations discrimination, and provide quarterly reports for the next two years regarding steps it has taken to come into compliance and whether it has turned away any prospective customers.""* 

Worryingly (in my opinion), SCOTUS did NOT rule that the baker had a right to refuse to create a custom wedding cake for these two gentlemen's wedding. (For what it's worth, the baker never refused to *sell* the couple a cake. He refused to make them a custom cake.) They simply reversed the original rulings based on the CCRC's blatant hostility to the baker's Christianity, which they stated violated his first amendment rights. This leaves the door open for further attempts by woke organizations like the CCRC to impose its ideologies on private citizens. 

As an aside, after SCOTUS's ruling, the CCRC decided to drop a second case against this baker, which they had brought after he refused to make a custom cake for a TIM to celebrate his transition.

&#x200B;

> Denying a service to someone because they have a different religious beliefs than you is different than forcing others to police their language, deny sex based protections and touch their genitals. 

I'm not arguing that the two cases or situations are all that similar. I was simply arguing against Kabloona's statement that legalization of gay marriage does/did not impose requirements on other groups. Because there were and are quite a few organizations who are using gay marriage to do just that. Gay marriage isn't the problem. I don't even think liberalism is the problem here. It's identity politics and how it fucks us all. It takes anything regarded as ""minority"" and tries to force all of us to worship at its frequently cock-shaped altar.

All that being said, I'd argue that it's beyond absurd that either of these cases were ever even in front of a court. The country of Canada needs a judge to rule that women should not be compelled to touch a man's penis. This is fucking crazy. The US *couldn't even get a court to rule* that a local small time baker can't be forced to bake a cake for a function he doesn't agree with. Not as crazy, but pretty fucking crazy."

A man who hates his body isnt automatically trans. A man who hates his genitals and wishes he has a vulva isnt trans. What makes a person trans is BELIEVING that they are a woman ""on the inside"" and that particular feeling or behaviors are evidence of that.

Miranda Yardley is a transsexual male (a man who had surgery to feminize his body including genital reconstruction) who now acknowledges that he is and always has been a man and that claiming to be a woman in any way is sexist and harmful. He speaks out on this a lot. He wears make up and wears his hair long but doesnt claim that he is ""socially presenting as a woman"" because that would be extremely sexist.

Maybe the real problem is just the stigmatization of mental illnesses--at least in my pov that's a larger issue here. Not all mental illness is ""bad."" It's just not the norm.)

There are cases where the lack of a cosmetic procedure may have a significant negative impact on a person's life, such as in the case of burn victims.

> Professor C√°el Keegan, who teaches Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, said the hat's reference to pink [vulvas] is suspect: *""We know that any time feminism starts centering people based on anatomy, that gets kind of dangerous for trans people.""* **He** also pointed out that both cisgender women and transgender women are fighting for autonomy over their own bodies. The hat's allusion to the [vulva] also ignores the fact that some transgender women opt against undergoing gender-affirmation surgery. Keegan said that the pussyhat can promote the unconscious suggestion that only cisgender women are raped, which is untrue. In fact, he explained, ""A lot of the reasons [transgender women] are attacked is because they do not possess that piece of anatomy.""

Feminism centering people who are female, no fucking way?? Women talking about their anatomy is dangerous for men LOL I can't even, this is too much for me."

And women did try and succeeded in working underground in coal mines - despite being BARRED in many places by men. So, even if women could work the mines men banned them. Or, if they weren't outright banned, they sexually harassed, raped, not taught safety regulations by men so the women would get injured...""Women in Coal Mining West Virginia"" is a Medium article that talks all about how those noble male coal miners treated their female coworkers.

What if some women don't care if they're beautiful and if men find them beautiful ? What if they don't give much thought about their appearance bc it's not in their personalities?

1405,Yesnomaybluurgh,"> the societally imposed body dysmorphia and self-hatred

When i was a teen i thought i was fat even though looking back on pics i was a tall skinny bean with long legs. But when i sit down my thighs would appear larger (like it does for every damn human being) so i thought i was fat. I also had a phase of internalized misogyny where i dressed with baggy clothes and despised girly girls and thought acting like a dude was cool. I've also had body hate for some of my features like my nose bc i was heavily bullied on it. I literally thought i looked monstruous just bc my nose is bulbous, and that everybody was looking at me in horror.

1411,Hypocritical-Cunt,"So mowing the lawn triggers his dysphoria, but having his wife do his laundry, wash his dishes, and raise his children is fine. 

Right. üôÑ

I‚Äôm sorry your spouse turned out to be an asshole. I wish you and your kids all the best ‚Äî which starts with removing their leech of a father from the household. Good luck."
1412,vulvapeople,"Your husband is going to bankrupt you, and, as another commenter has mentioned, could very well be putting you in the position of paying him alimony and child support when you finally get fed up with all of this.

Once he becomes a ""stay at home wife/mother"", I know and you know and everyone here knows that you will continue to do 99 percent of the housework and child care while he studies and does his nails.

If you have another baby, he's going to breastfeed it and expose it to the cocktail of chemicals he's on to make lactation possible. If you don't approve, likely he'll do it behind your back.

Also, men don't have a good track record with paying back their wives when their wives work to put them through school. If he does manage to get through school and get a job (but knowing how TIMs like this operate, more likely he's trying to be a leech), you will see none of that money as his wife or as his ex-wife.

Lastly, is the trust fund just for you, as in he's not a beneficiary? This is your opportunity to get the hell out of this marriage, pay off your share of *his* debt, and make sure he doesn't get his grubby hands on the money *your* relative gave you."
1413,,">This is probably going to be rambly, sorry.

No sorry! So many people who turn up here start with some version of ""Sorry."" It's ok! You're allowed to rant. We're not going to hurt you and you have every right in the world to be heard.

&#x200B;

>Honestly I was originally going to post this in relationships, or the sub for spouses of trans people, but a friend suggested here.

If I said ""Yeah you probably would have gotten shouted down."" that would be isolating behavior, which I absolutely don't want to do. Instead I'll say ""We have seen other people post in those subs in the past and they were shouted down."" If, however, you are seeking alternative points of view, their input may be valuable.

&#x200B;

>(Like she wanted to jump straight to breastfeeding despite barely being into her transition; it was costly and not something, from our research, that would help our baby much if at all and would purely be for her benefit. In the end the cost made her agree to put the idea aside (but not without a lot of tears from both of us)).

Holy shit, yeah. I'm glad this fell through. Male bodies cannot make the breastmilk you would have needed for your babies health. While it's true that male humans can lactate, it is ABSOLUTELY not the same thing nutritionally speaking as the breastmilk of a mother. I'm sure you know this already, since you *are* a mom, but you have different ""milks"" based on how far you are from the baby's birth, and each stage of that milk is balanced in such a way as to keep the baby healthy and alive. It changes. Male milk doesn't.

Another critically important thing on the milk subject is that you produce sugars in your milk meant to feed your baby's symbiotic bacteria so they protect the baby from harmful outside bacteria (not the baby itself, your child actually can't digest or use those sugars when they're a newborn). Male milk can't do that either.

&#x200B;

>My wife is high maintenance. She gets to go to a nice salon for her hair care and waxing needs, she owns a dozen nice bras, she has a complicated skin routine, she gets to tan and get new clothes and owns way more shoes then I do.

Regardless of whether or not this person is trans. If one parent is saving for the children and the other is doing this crap, then they would be seen- rightfully so- an an irresponsible parent. They don't get a pass. 

&#x200B;

>She still gets home, eats dinner with us, *then hangs out in the kitchen with me and the kids while I do the dishes and clean up*. She tells me about her day. I like this part honestly, but I wish she would help because it would get done a lot faster if both of us were doing it.

Can't even be bothered to help you clean up and give you a chance to hang out with your children? That's shitty behavior. Again, this person doesn't get a pass just because they're trans.

You say you're being treated like ""the help""? I'm sorry to break it to you, but that's what you are right now.

1417,konradosho,"Oh. My. Lord. I want to say this first: I am so sorry you are going through this, I truly understand what it is like to love someone who does not deserve your love.

I‚Äôll tell you what, though. *You* deserve to be loved. What this man is doing to you is not love.

This is an extremely abusive relationship. Your wife/husband/whatever the hell he wants to call himself or identify as (does not matter) is an abuser. His behavior is so entitled and selfish that it‚Äôs comical. How the hell can a grown ass adult think it‚Äôs even remotely acceptable to take advantage of his spouse like this? You are literally going without things you need (like BRAS) because he all of a sudden decided that he wanted to live out his fantasy of what a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is?

Everyone says this, but get a lawyer. Once you divorce that guy he is probably going to try and sue for custody and he is obviously not deserving of that. And for the love of god do NOT SHARE ANY OF YOUR TRUST MONEY WITH HIM. You‚Äôve got to protect yourself and you‚Äôve got to protect your kids, and money can give you a means of achieving that protection. I repeat, DO NOT GIVE THIS MAN ANY MONEY. 

Keep thinking about the welfare of your babies, too. This is not someone they should be around, and he likely hangs out with people that could potentially hurt them. Your kids are way more important than anything he‚Äôll cry about, way more important than his goddamned hucow pregnancy fetish (that‚Äôs literally what this shit is), his cross dressing and his narcissism.

Going forward, document EVERYTHING, especially those credit card expenses. Do NOT let this person have a dime of YOUR inheritance--  he's already put y'all in debt with no regard to your family's financial needs.  If you're not on contraception, get on it NOW (men make jokes about women ""trapping"" them when they're no better üôÑ), the last thing you need are an influx of hormones clouding your judgment. Before you leave, have an exit strategy with support on hand, just in case. 

 It's very telling how your partner wants to experience ""motherhood "" when there have been daily opportunities to parent their children and refuse to do so. He wants a start over on your dime, haven't you given enough?  

It is not on you to validate him,  it's not your responsibility to sacrifice so he can feel whole,  your ONLY responsibilities are to yourself and children --kudos for finding the strength to do just that. 

Parenthood is about sacrifice, relationships are about compromise and reciprocation- your ""wife"" is acting like a child, not a partner.

It is pretty common for AGPs to ""transistion"" when their wives are pregnant or recently given birth/have small children.

I hope you take your money and create a new life for yourself and your children. Trans issues aside, your partner is as you said being callous. You deserve to be happy and healthy, whether that's alone with your children or with another partner who actually supports you.

ETA: and please find a lawyer who can help you freeze joint accounts and college funds you may have set up for your children.

You will look back in a year (or a month... or a week) after you leave and think, THANK THE GODDESS I DUMPED HIS ASS!

1427,jelliknight,"This is so gross and extreme it almost looks fake.  


Your husband started transitioning while you were pregnant? That's really common. They cant stand someone else being the center of attention.  


Then he wanted to breastfeed? That's *sick.* As you said, it wouldn't do anything to benefit the baby, it's all about him getting what he wants. He wants to use your infant as a prop at best and a sex toy at worst. Then he cried over not being allowed to waste your very tight money on abusing your infant??  


Now he's driving you into debt for his vanity. He doesn't do his share of the childcare or housework.  


""I'm treated like the help"" That's what you are. You are not in a marriage and from the looks of it you never have been. You are his servant. Your life is only to support him.  


""A relative of mine left a trust fund to be given to me when I turn 30. That's in six months"" That's why he's still around. I was wondering, usually they transition while the wife is pregnant, and then once the baby is a toddler they start sleeping around and eventually ditch her to life a life of 'freedom' with their new trans friends. I was wondering why he was still around and here it is, he wants to live his life of freedom on your money. As soon as it goes in to your shared accounts he will be entitled to use it and he will. Divorce will take longer than 6 months. Find a way to delay this or immediately put it into a savings account in your name only that can't be touched for another few years. If you don't he will leave you broke with two kids, I guarantee it.  


Separate now, don't wait another day. Yes he has always been this selfish. No he will never change. You have never been in a marriage, you have been a prop in his fantasy life. A marriage is an equal partnership. You never had that. It sounds like you had a fucked up childhood and that damaged your expectations for what a relationship should be. Don't let your kids suffer the same way. Show them how a person respects themselves."
1428,fuckincaillou,"> My older brother has already received his inheritance and is fully willing to let me borrow as much as I need for a good lawyer.

This alone says so much more than you might realize. To me, it says that even on the outside looking in, your brother knows something isn't right with your marriage even beyond the trans aspects. That your brother is, as a man, looking at the track record of your wife/husband and finding it lacking. The trans aspect of this situation is just the candy coating most people might see first, hiding the truth of the matter, which is that your wife/husband does not partake equally in homemaking, childrearing, or financially."
1429,peregrine_throw,"JFC reading that was exhausting, what more living it. The question that kept repeated popping in my mind was ""Why is she still with him??"" Not only is he an awful partner and father, but he's financially dragging you down with debt.

If I were in your shoes, I would lawyer up and divorce this guy ASAP especially considering the trust fund paying out in a few months. And if the trust fund pays out in a lump sum, read ASAP in bold and italics and discreetly consult a lawyer regarding how to maintain sole control over and benefit of it while you're married and while in the process of divorce.

He could have eaten it himself and I'd have never known, but he drove home with the pizza and we split it 50/50. That's how it was with *everything* then, or we'd try to give the other person the better share.

I know I wouldn't want to go through life and raise kids with someone who isn't in it as a partner. And I'd wager that if you stick around and give him access to the trust fund, that money is going to be gone.

1434,DextersXXarmy,"I never use Reddit and signed up just to respond to this, because I have a friend that went through this exact thing, and a few others that had to deal w the courts regarding custody/divorce/abuse:

PLEASE DO NOT underestimate your spouse. At all. Never assume you know how they will respond. This is hard to do because you feel you know them, but this an abusive, dangerously entitled, male. I would not put it past them to be dangerous or vidictive when told they cannot have what they want. You have kids, which they may see as a way to hurt or control you.

You're seeing the very best of their behavior right now because you have something they want- inheritance and a chance to play mommy. What's going to happen once they realize their meal ticket AND validation is leaving? *Hopefully nothing*, but it's best to plan for the very worst, because telling men NO brings out their rage. And telling a man NO that is entitled enough to ""play woman"" on your dime is likely to be even worse. 

In practical terms, this means planning quietly and making sure you have a safety plan in place. It may seem extreme, but if you can talk to a DV specialist about how to safely leave, you really should. It cannot hurt. 

Document EVERYTHING, and save every single text, phone call, email, everything. Get an app that records everything off your device. Write doen everything they have done that has been harmful. Never say or type anything that you wouldn't want read in court.

I know this sounds majorly paranoid, but I watched a few friends get trounced in court by (and lose custody to) abusers, because they tried to be conciliatory and reasonable. The abusers had every text, my friends did not. Even little things like being 10 min late a few times adds up when read to the court. 

Be a shark, even though you might want to be the bigger person, so you don't lose custody and end up paying this asshole support too. 

Also- you mentioned moving. It's ok to try to position yourself in the best possible place to win. I guarantee your spouce will take every advantage they can, and hes starting ahead of you. Do your homework and try to get the odds in your favor. I'm so happy you can get a lawyer because that will make all the difference.

1435,RFANA,"So sorry to hear this OP. I see many red flags in what you‚Äôve written, and also a lot of crappy feelings I‚Äôve had while in relationships with men. Like when they act like you‚Äôre the help and make no effort to include you in conversations, at your own house. You are clearly a strong woman who has stuff going for her. Your wife is lucky to have you, holding everything down. Tread carefully with therapy as many therapists are in the transcult and will fall for the pity parties and crocodile tears. Beware that it seems like your wife might be jealous of you, which is simply misogyny since he is jealous of the seemingly good things about being female and doesn‚Äôt know half of the negatives. This spending issue would have me extremely worried. If he wants fancy clothes maybe he could find a thrift store. IF I were you I would be doing anything to protect the oncoming assets for the benefit of your children, screw letting him blow it all. I was raised in a family with narcissistic traits, trust me, he will have no qualms spending it all on himself on shit he don‚Äôt need and leaving nothing for you and the kids. Please take care"
1436,MarkTwainiac,"OP, I am so sorry you are dealing with such a selfish spouse who has gaslighted you in so many ways. Your story brought tears to my eyes, made me glad I'm divorced & long single, & called to my mind a question attributed to Dorothy Parker: what fresh hell is this?

I agree with all the other posters so far, but thought it might be helpful to add one point: It's not clear where you are from, but if you are from the USA, please be aware that states vary in how they view wealth inherited before as well as during a marriage. In some states, inherited wealth is included in community property; in other states, it's totally excluded. So depending on where you live, your spouse might not have a valid claim to/on your inheritance. A good lawyer can advise.

Also, there's no need to borrow money in order to consult a divorce or matrimonial lawyer. With top-flight matrimonial attorneys in the US, the first appointment & attendant advice is always free - & if it's not, the lawyer is probably an unethical shyster.  What's more, if you are coming into an inheritance in the foreseeable future, any decent divorce or matrimonial attorney will take you on (if you want) & bill you later.  They are accustomed to this.

I feel for you & wish you & your kids all the best."

Let's put this in gender-neutral terms: your partner is driving you into debt because they need money to maintain a certain image of themselves.

Your partner is making selfish plans with your family's money (presumably left to you because your relative loves *you* and wants *you* to get a little boost in security). You deserve so much better. 

And, in case anyone calls you a transphobe, please remember this: in the most charitable, pro-trans terms, transition is a lifelong medical, psychological, and physical journey. Your spouse, in other words, isn't going to stop wanting maternal experiences or a certain expensive aesthetic. You're doing the kind thing by letting them pursue that freely."

Recognize though that your wife is getting a support network from her new friends who are backing her narcissistic thinking and making all of this easier to enforce.  You need to be spending time with people who are going to back you and who are going to be pulling you away from trans cult talk and into rational lets treat people on their actions talk.

This is pretty typical of heterosexual, married trans-identified men. This man is unhinged and needs therapy. He also needs to be left to fend for himself.

Take your kids and get out now. See a lawyer about making sure he can't touch that trust fund. Get your car, go to college, look after yourself and your children. He abandoned you all already for his weird fetish. Return the favour. Build the life you want and deserve.

As I was reading, all I was thinking was ""would you accept this behaviour if he was still your husband?"". Would *anybody* expect you to tolerate a man behaving like this towards you? Would you doubt yourself even a little if a man put your family in debt for vain desires, wanted to take your maternity leave, demanded to be the one who got the education and the new car, refused to do any kind of chores?

If you stay, you will disappear. You will stop being a person. You will be this man's wallet, womb and comforter. Your entire life will center around what he thinks he wants. And if you wake up from that, you will never forgive yourself. Leave now while you can. Nothing is stopping you. Leave.

1454,indiareef,"My main concern is your money issues. You need to be out ASAP in order for her not to be able to claim your inheritance as community property. 

I would discuss this quickly with a divorce lawyer and figure out how to protect your assets. Those assets are going to be needed to support yourself and your children and not the uncontrolled spending of your partner. 

In most states, just leaving the marital home is the start of an unofficial separation and any moneys made after that aren‚Äôt considered community property. But leaving the home could also be considered abandonment depending on the state and if you own your current house it could also be construed as you giving up claims to it. Again...all that depends on your state. 

I would work as fast and quickly as possible to serve her with paperwork in order to get the ball rolling. And clearly they have zero concern for your well being, your mental health, fiscal health or your children.  This is beyond unacceptable and absolutely selfish on their part. 

You deserve a partner who is actually your partner. There is nothing here that shows they are anything else but completely selfish at this point.

1 my dad behaved the same way, he usted to buy for him the best clothes, the best shoes etc while my mother would never buy anything for herself even nowadays she struggles to get nice things for herself she would always prefer to buy things for me and my sister 
2. My dad always said she worked more than my mom but is not true , he had a full time job and my mom a middle time but she was the one who did  all the housework and also took care my sis and me (we were very difficult children because we usted to be sick all the time ) he would never ever took us to a Dr appointment, or pay for any kind of treatment 
3. He would always say he paid all the bills but it was not true he used to made the as my mom but still he wanted her to paid for everything ( and you know what he did all the money he got he was burning it all with his mistresses) when my sis or I asked him something for school o whatever he would yell at us and be very aggressive no matter if we were teens of toddlers 
4. He would be very mean to my mother also with my sister and I but with his friends he would always be super kind and supportive so if my mother complained about him nobody would believe her 
Those are just some examples but what I want you to see is that you don‚Äôt have to be afraid  to leave her I want you to take all the anger and desperation you feel to set you free from this situation because it only gets more horrible as time passes I want you to take the best decision FOR YOU, because this person is going to suck the life away from you and when she gets done she won‚Äôt think twice to leave you after all the sacrifices you‚Äôd done, this people don‚Äôt change regardless of their gender, you will never archive your dreams if you stay with her , she doesn‚Äôt care about her family 
I know you are going to say I have a ton a daddy issues or whatever but at the most important thing I want to realize is that you are just in time to change your story and your children‚Äôs (we do notice with the time that thing are not ok, one way or another)

You go without and see to it that the laundry is done, the yard is mowed, and dinner is cooked because that is what women do. We do stuff because it needs to be done, not for any other reason.

I would talk to a lawyer and try to understand the financial situation better ‚Äî the specifics will depend on what state you‚Äôre in.  Usually an inheritance is considered separate property, and you should make sure you keep it separate and anything you buy with it from all the other marital assets.  You probably should NOT pay off debt that your husband incurred with that money.  Ask the lawyer how his debt is treated, etc.  you may or may not be liable for it.

Even if the trans component was not a factor, it would still be regarded as an abusive relationship, both mental and financial abuse. It won't improve, and will only get worse until you trust has been exhausted, then he will leave you. As one or two have said, I would also get the advice from a women's DV centre, because when this person gets wind that the money he planned to use for yet more frilly bras is about to be taken away, things could go badly really quickly. As Dexter and a few others recommended, do your planning on the quiet, and I would add, delete this thread soon.

We know he is manipulating you ‚Äî he apparently can no longer do chores like mow the lawn, because it 'triggers his gender dysphoria' ‚Äî yet has no qualms in using a penis to impregnate you (something he also did 'as a man'). Rather *selective dysphoria*. You are being played. Get out while you can, and before any more financial and emotional damage is done.

The best decisions about the future can only be made based on what you know in the present. You know that money is being taken away from you and your kids. Now your inheritance is coming in and your spouse already has that money earmarked for a new car and education for him. Given the current situation you'll be slaving away with a third child in ratty second hand clothes while you're spouse lives like a king and enjoys the fruits of what your family intended for you.

Your spouse does nothing around the house, no inside or outside chores. He goes to work, comes home and while you're slaving away he shares his stories and problems but never offers to help. Your partner can't take care of the kids. There is no partnership. They're doing nothing to support you and to hold up their end. Instead it's just taking and taking.

Please just imagine if a friend had come to you with this. How would you counsel her?

1516,AssignedMomAtBirth,"I‚Äôm so sorry that you are going through this. Have you read about autogynephelia ? If not, you need to. Your husband sounds like a textbook example.  Autogynephilia, or transvestic fetishism, is a sexual paraphillia. And sexual paraphillias tend to cluster.  For example , Many autogynephiles are also exhibitionists, masochists, ‚Äúadult babies‚Äù. Pediphiles, Etc. I would get on his computer and search his porn use  to see what you are dealing with at once, and find out how to document it legally in case you need it for custody / divorce.  If you find something really unsettling, you may need to call a lawyer or even the police. Be ready for that possibility when you do this. There is also an overlap of autogynephelia with personality disorders and narcissism. And when they take hormones, they can become very unstable. This is all very damaging to you and the kids. I would suggest that you get out of the marriage at once.  Stay with relatives or something until you can get your money and a new job home and school for your kids , a divorce and pay off debt. 

One other thing I need to say is that your baby should NOT be breastfed by a transitioning male via chemically induced lactation.  This has been done once at Mt Sinai using dangerous drugs.  there are no studies to prove that this is safe for the baby, and even if there were , I wouldn‚Äôt trust them. Common sense says NO to this.  It‚Äôs likely part of his particular fetish , as could be pregnancy and periods. Jamie Shoupe  is a former transwomen who had autogynephelia and is very open about his experience. If you want to help your husband you need to be honest with him that he isn‚Äôt a women but he has a fetish which has spiraled out of control and it‚Äôs destroying your family.  If he is reasonable he will recognize this and seek help. Therapy cbt and Drugs can be taken to reduce compulsion and depression that come with cross dressing. This is the better way to deal with things as opposed to enabling his delusion.  

There is a community of trans widows.  I  met one recently and I‚Äôve seen many posts from them on twitter and reddit. 

Again I‚Äôm really sorry that you are going though this.

Also , You need to prioritize your own health and safety and that of the kids and stop being a doormat for your abusive husband.  If you choose to stay, rules need to be set for equal distribution of work , childcare, spending  and chores. Debt needs to be paid off at once and no more shopping/ hair/nail for hubby until you‚Äôre in a position to afford that sort of expense. You‚Äôll probably need a lot of money for CBT therapy and medications for your husband. Is that how you want to spend your inheritance ? 

And absolutely NO male babysitters, period.  That includes transwomen. Sorry, there are just way too many stories of sexual abuse to take that risk. 

Good luck to you."

Like really they think that you should have a baby and go back to work so they can take your money and stay home with a baby when it‚Äôs your body that‚Äôs healing, when it‚Äôs your body that‚Äôs equipped to feed that baby? RUN RUN RUN don‚Äôt feel bad don‚Äôt look back I hope they don‚Äôt get any kind of alimony from you in the divorce they don‚Äôt deserve it. Leave her with her credit card debt and temper tantrums and run!"
1521,,"I would say get out before you get your inheritance money. Your partner sounds lazy, selfish, and emotionally immature, and I think your partner might try to keep the money to himself if he gets a hold of it. This could lead to financial abuse, and him controlling you with the money. Get out now and make sure you keep the money away from him."
1522,MarionetteLady,"Wow, if it makes you feel better. You'll probably be canonised when you die. 

Nobody in the world would possible judge you for getting out, you're still young and from when you've written seem to be doing the lions share of everything without any support. I mean, the fact that your partner wants you to pop out another baby so they can enact out their maternity leave fantasy while you slog onwards. What an SOB. 

I don't know you, but you deserve better and your partner needs a wake up call if that's even possible at this stage. Which I doubt."
1523,raging-herbivore,"Your partner is abusive. There are many types of abuse, and he fits several (financial, emotional, etc.) Your partner does not care about you or your kids if he‚Äôs putting his own aesthetic desires above his family‚Äôs needs. It‚Äôs great that your brother is willing to help; take advantage of it. You are making the right decision, and you‚Äôve got lots of people here who support you. Stay strong. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1524,daughersmom,"I'm sure you've discovered in looking online that ALL of the available advice is about how you need to help your husband become the woman he thinks he's always been.  No sign of the fact that living with a full-blown narcissist is damaging to you and your kids and that YOU ARE BEING ABUSED.  Don't believe the hype.  You need to take care of yourself and your kids and stop catering to this abuser.  Leave.  Take your kids.  Contact a domestic abuse hotline.  they might be able to connect you with a shelter in the state you desire to live in.  Lie like a rug.  Don't give him a single clue about what you're planning.  There's no reason to think that he won't continue manipulating you the way he has been.  And, if he thinks he can't get his way, there's also no reason to think he won't use physical means to keep you in place.  

Right now, all you can think about is your kids.  Let that motivate you.  So many of these guys are paedophiles and abusers.  Not all, but a lot.  I hope when you get yourself detangled from this mess, you will take the time to take care of yourself as well.  Many spouses have ended up with basically PTSD after enduring the craziness of these situations.

Take care and good luck!"

Having dealt with narcissistic partners myself, I encourage you to leave now.  I think you may be in physical danger right now.  Even if violence was never part of the relationship before, do you think that's not Plan B when Mr. Asshole realizes he's losing out on the free play money?  He'll throw you against the wall and stomp on your neck before you even talk to that lawyer.  Get out of the house now.  Pack a suitcase with valuables and the papers you need, take the kids and go to your brother, a shelter, a hotel, anywhere.  What do you think his mental process is right now?  People like him are psychic where their interests are concerned.   HE KNOWS you aren't happy and are getting uppity.  Run right now.  It won't hurt your case, it will help it actually.   Signed, ex gf of a formerly sweet sensitive guy who pulled a gun on me when I wanted to leave the relationship.  I got out of there by apologizing profusely for not understanding him.  It was in the middle of the night, I spent the night in my car.  Before that, there was never a hint of violence.  Do you get it, that's always Plan B for this type of guy.  Also, if he kills you, he will get away with it, because, don't you know, it was a sex game gone wrong."

You're not a bad person for leaving someone who makes you work this hard. Men may identify as women but they don't change. I was just reading about how men are far more likely to leave a wife for getting sick than the other way around. Women are far more loyal. The way your spouse is acting you can probably expect he would keep acting like a  man as he is doing now, expecting you do to do all the home labor, and if you get sick will be on his way. It's important that you don't let this notion that he isn't a man somehow make you believe he's different than other men. ALL MEN tell you they are not like other men and they can be trusted when they are working to best take advantage of you. Run. Take your money and go. And spend it on YOURSELF. You will find someone who treasures you and does his share if you treasure yourself and stop over taxing yourself to keep someone so hard to please happy."

You do everything and he still manages to act like this... no appreciation for you and his idea of womanhood seems hypersexualized and over-the-top so I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs what we call an autogynephile, a man who takes erotic pleasure in seeing himself as a woman. It‚Äôs not his dysphoria that‚Äôs keeping him from chores, it‚Äôs his male entitlement to female labor, he‚Äôs manipulating you.

I don't think that we are biased in your favour. It's just that here we think women are not slaves and deserve their own happiness, exactly as everyone else.
Your situation, but with reversed sexes (careless mother), would be considered awful and his mother would be advising him to divorce you. No one would be this understanding with a flawed female. Society demands very much from us but forgives men and find excuses for them.
I'm very sorry for what you're experiencing.
I just wanted to add that I find very odd his way of dealing with dysphoria: working out at the gym doesn't increase his muscles? And more importantly, fathering a third child (impregnating his wife with his penis) doesn't trigger his dysphoria?
This guy is not transitioning. He's only putting make up on his face. And everyone in his family is siding with him regardless of his wrongdoings, which is very dangerous for you. Don't buy their emotional blackmail. You're right to be concerned and you have the right to live a peaceful live. That you choose not to jump into a deep well is not selfish. It's the sensible thing to do, for you and your kids."

""Last month she got mad at me for washing one of her lacy bras with my  sports bras, upset enough to the point of crying and all I could do was  stand there staring at this grown woman sobbing because a bit of lace  came off her bra"" *This is a form of emotional abuse.*

&#x200B;

"" I have three bras and they're ratty sports bras..."", "" My wife is high maintenance. She gets to  go to a nice salon for her hair care and waxing needs, she owns a dozen  nice bras, she has a complicated skin routine, she gets to tan and get  new clothes and owns way more shoes then I do.

We cannot afford this. 95% of our credit card debt is from her high maintenance needs."" *What you're describing here is financial abuse. It isn't okay that you're barely getting the necessities you need, but your spouse spends like crazy.*

&#x200B;

""She's literally never been alone with our children for any significant  amount of time. I left her and the kids for four days last year for a  friend's out of state wedding (that friend paid for, and we didn't feel  comfortable asking her to pay for the whole family), and she couldn't  handle that."" *You're spouse is a narcissist, and so the kids are only good when they're fun.*

&#x200B;

""I'm so sick of it all. She won't have a real conversation, instead she  just bursts into tears, has excuses or just gets mad and tells me she  needs some alone time if I try to talk to her about anything. "" *More narcissism.*

&#x200B;

""A relative of mine left a trust fund to be given to me when I turn 30.  That's in six months. The plan was to pay off all our debt, get me a new  car because my current one is on its last legs, and for me to go back  to school, then after I was done with school she would go back. And  then, we'd take the remainder of the trust fund and move to a cheaper  city to live where we would buy a house. "" *Narcissists are selfish.*

&#x200B;

"" Wife told me last week that she wants to be the one to go back to school  first, and that she can do the stay at home mom thing while she's doing  it and of course, that means she gets the new car while I'll get her  current car. She also said that it'd be a good time for us to have our  last baby, since she could stay home with him/her while in school after I  went back to work and it'd ""practically be maternity leave"" *Narcissists are delusional.*

&#x200B;

"" So instead of having an honest conversation about who should go to  school and how we'd handle the trust fund money, she made it about her,  and how *she* felt watching me while I  was pregnant and her agony of not being able to breastfeed her baby or  of knowing she could never be pregnant ..."" *That's a narcissist for ya.*"
1548,Jo_in_TN,"Oh, my.  I'm so sorry you are going through all of this.

It appears that you are emotionally and financially invested in your family to the point of **denying yourself** needed things.

Unfortunately, your wife is emotionally and financially invested only in herself to the point of **denying her family** needed things.

Trans or not, you would be a fool to let this person get one dollar from your trust fund.  I know that's harsh, but your spouse is now a member of the ""cult of trans"" and it will affect you in ways too numerous to list here.  

And until you get a legal separation, you will be responsible for any bills she accrues.

Take care."
1549,smashy-galore,"I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, your spouse sounds like a typical narcissist who is stealing your life and your energy. It's unfair to you, and you don't deserve so little self-care and so much of the domestic and emotional labor ‚Äì as well as this big debt burden! We've seen over and over that a trans spouse will drain away all the financial resources for their transition ‚Äì and then just keep taking. Any reasonable person would feel badly about doing this to you. Leave and don't let your spouse get any of your trust money if you can work that out. Learn about financial management, go to debtor's anonymous if you have to (it's actually very supportive and not as dogmatic as other 12-steps), but get out of the debt lifestyle for your own sanity. Put your windfall money into savings ‚Äì as much as you can. You'll find if you're not leaking money you can do a lot more with it and take care of yourself and your children and make all your own dreams come true. You need financial freedom. I would also recommend addressing your codependence in this relationship. This is not a judgement, I have similar issues and working on myself to find my own peace was the right thing because I can't control others. (Edit for child to children.)"
1550,SadSwoleMaiden,"Run. Good grief, I'm so sorry you're in this situation, but for the sake of your children and your own sanity, you have to.  This isn't a trans issue, this is an issue with your spouse being selfish and abusive and taking advantage.  Spouse absolutely ignoring your needs and those of your children while driving your family into debt and refusing to shoulder their share of the burden? Not OK no matter who they are.

The trans issue is just the crazy icing on a crappy cake - this person seems to be using it as the excuse for their appalling behaviour.

Very glad you've got a supportive brother.  Stick with him, get that lawyer and don't talk to sister about it.  Hate to say it, but if she knows what you are doing, she may sabotage and tell your spouse if she's trying to get you to stay together."

I‚Äôm sorry for being blunt but you‚Äôre right, love is not enough and it‚Äôs time to extricate yourself and your children before more terrible damage is done. 

I need to add this: if you‚Äôre feeling guilty about leaving him because of transitioning, remind yourself that you‚Äôre not leaving him for being trans, you‚Äôre leaving him for being a sociopath."

She has/had a loving wife that took care of her and respected her when most would‚Äôve left in your situation, yet she cannot look passed herself long enough to realize that there is two people in this marriage not just her. I‚Äôm a woman and it isn‚Äôt every aspect of my life. I don‚Äôt disregard others to make myself feel better as a woman. I don‚Äôt whine to other men and treat them different because I have periods and they don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt envy men for something they cannot control, so I‚Äôm not sure why she envies you for simply existing (being able to get pregnant and the sorts). Honestly it‚Äôs bullshit. Idk what it is about this theme that makes it okay for some trans women to completely revert back to children. In this political climate we have today, they are cradled by an entire movement like babies; so much so that they forget that they are adults and that their feelings and needs do not come first in every aspect of life. I‚Äôd expect a child to think/feel/act this way because children are to be dependent and protected by society and the adults around them. But I‚Äôll be damned if I sit here and hold a 30 year olds hand and allow them to act like my children. God bless you and get out while you can. Unless she can look beyond her damn self for 2 seconds out of the 10 years y‚Äôall have been together, I don‚Äôt see this being beneficial or salvageable for you. Trans people like this should just date each other. Can you imagine the narcissistic black hole the two of them would create in a small room? One upping each other‚Äôs tears and triggers. Good God."

My girlfriend has talked about how she‚Äôd like to be the one to carry a baby for us someday, and I would never ever think to go through the cost and effort of causing myself to lactate unless she ends up having major difficulty with it herself. Not to mention the whole point of maternity leave is to allow a woman some time to physically and emotionally recover from the act of giving birth. It sounds like your spouse is just obsessed with acting out her idea of womanhood, as if it‚Äôs nothing more than a frilly costume and a performance."

I know the most important things are your and your children‚Äôs safety and well-being, and that probably means divorce. But I‚Äôm worried about his getting half your money, so I would actually say there‚Äôs no Hope here and file for divorce BEFORE your birthday. I would think that may protect your trust fund from your spouse getting half of it. They sound so selfish and self-absorbed. Definitely no sex and no unprotected sex and oh, so they‚Äôre on hormones but also still fertile? Hmm. Anyway protect yourself and your family and get away from this narcissist as soon as you can. They will still have visitation or even custody rights but you will not be chained to them and their bad mistakes. Half those credit card bills will probably be your responsibility, if they‚Äôre in both your names. So sorry your spouse has taken this selfish journey."

You have to keep your money away from your spouse who will spend it on themselves and leave you & the kids destitute. You also need to get out now! If you don't you'll continue to be abused by your spouse! You must leave for the health & safety of you and your children. Your spouse is showing dangerous mental illness! 

You already know it's wrong and you know you need to leave. Counseling may work in the future but right now you have protect yourself and your children!

Don‚Äôt do her laundry. Just stop. Leave her in a pile and let her do it. Same with any orher chores that are for her.

When you mow the lawn, ‚ÄúI was planning on mowing the lawn tomorrow, could you please take care of breakfast and clean up while I do that‚Äù. It sucks that you have to think of the chores. But you do. So delegate

1571,FruitTreesRule,"If you do divorce, I'd be very surprised is this dude demands full, or even part, custody. He can't bother to do any chores for himself so cleaning up after two kids would give him a huge kick in the balls. 

Plus it sounds like he can't handle child rearing in general since he pawns that off to you 100% of the time. 

People say ""leave him, divorce him"" and although I agree I do recognize that lighting a bomb on your marriage is going to be emotionally devastating, even if it's the right thing to do in the long run. Usually when people knee jerk into divorce with out a plan they are left vulnerable. 

I suggest coming up with a plan b over the next few months. Talk to a divorce lawyer to come up with a plan. Slowly disconnect yourself emotionally from your spouse. Read this sub. Document their behavior to reinforce why you want to leave. Educate yourself on the financial side of divorce, and staying married to a man who racks up debt. come up with a plan to financially protect yourself as much as possible. Find a confidant who will help you make this transition to being single again because it will be scary and painful at times. Again, read this sub because he and his friends will use the trans thing to leverage power over you, gaslight you, guilt trip you, etc. 

Good luck and post updates for support."

I have very little experience with transsexuals, but it's seems to me that when a person is transitioning, then that becomes the be all and end all to their existence. Everything centre's around them and their change, it consumes their mentality and opinion on almost everything.

Get out before you receive the money, as if you stay with this person, they will only be thinking about how they can get their hands on the money to spend on their new lifestyle, thus be taking the money away from your children and yourself."

Just a few tips, as I'm a single parent as well: buying a house is not worth it. My parents used to own one and the expenses like new central heating, .. can really break your neck when you don't have savings. Just renting something makes your income more planned. I've lived in cheap appartment blocks for most of my life and there are really good ones, very central in the city that have playgrounds in the garden and everything. You get used to it. If you can afford it, there are houses to rent as well. I also buy everything, from furniture to clothing thrifted or on flea markets. There are special flea markets for children's stuff, you should really look out for those! They usually have shoes as well. I was glad about that since good shoes are necessary for children and they can be really expensive. A library card is a good idea as well, my daughter just started reading. It is totally possible to raise children on your own, don't worry :) better times will come when you got rid of him"

1583,RaspberryInk,"\[edit\] I just read my post, and I'd just like to say from the start that I'm sorry you're going through this. It sounds really difficult, and I hope you have the support you need. The end of a marriage is rough, no matter the circumstances.

&#x200B;

To me it sounds like your SO is using (abusing) being trans and your love and accommodation for her to act like a spoiled, self-centered brat. This is probably mostly caused by deep, pervasive insecurity on her part, but it sounds like the insecurity is taking over as she tries way too hard to achieve a probably unachievable/unrealistic view of what it means to be ""female."" It sounds like there's some significant maturing that she needs to do, which probably needs a lot more therapy. I would expect there's a lifetime of work on her part, and depending on her own personality, it could even be unachievable. Real, deep change is always a long and difficult process.

More importantly, it's not your responsibility to solve her problems. Her internal emotional/psychological struggles are her own. It sounds like you've been supportive and tried, which IMO, is what a spouse should do. It's not a failing on your part if your SO has things that you can't resolve. Like you, I've always had a deep seated view that marriage is forever, but I had my marriage end due to my SO's mental illness. Like you, I struggled for a while with feeling like a failure for ""giving up."" I was unsure of myself and didn't know if I was making the right decision. It took years to work through it--no matter the circumstances, or how right the decision, ending a marriage is a tragic experience. Even if it's right, it sucks. Looking back a decade later, there was nothing I could do to help my ex. Staying was hurting us both. It was important to me to feel like I really tried and didn't just give up on my marriage, but it was ultimately the right decision to end it. You may not really know if you're making the right decision, but you have to care for yourself. If you really can't do it anymore, then trust yourself--you're doing the right thing."

1595,aladyfleeingzombies,"I probably do say sorry too much, and definitely for sure do it more after my wife transitioned. It was like living with a hormonal 12 year old for a bit there, and it was also really annoying because you can tell a hormonal 12 year old (like my mother told *me* and I fully plan on telling my daughter) that she's allowed to have emotions but not allowed to use those emotions as an excuse to treat those around her like dirt. You try to tell your trans wife that and you're apparently not being understanding of what she's going through. Which made me mad, but I ignored my anger and tried to be empathetic. 

All of what you said about breastfeeding is true and what we found on our research; wife did not like reading it at *all* and it and my ""lack of support for *her*"" (because, you know, I was 100% concerned about the baby's needs as well as the money) was a hot topic in therapy for too long. 

>Can't even be bothered to help you clean up and give you a chance to hang out with your children?

The kids are doing their own age appropriate chores too after dinner; and occasionally she'll give them a hand which actually isn't helpful because I want the kids learning how to do things and that it's part of them being apart of the household so everyone has chores. If I ask, she'll help me dry dishes or something, but I don't think I *should* have to ask you know? 

I looked at the ""mypartneristrans"" subreddit, and honestly it feels like there's a lot of very young people there, and/or those in the same place I was two years ago. I don't think they have any valid advice or would offer much support to me; it feels like it would be about my wife's needs and feelings if I did post there.

It feels dishonest, and like every evil ex wife stereotype, especially with how my home state treats trans people but given the state we live in I don't think courts here are going to look at the facts and put my kids and whats best for them first over my wife. 

The kids are all I care about. A little bit me, but honestly, 95% is them. Especially my daughter. She's not a doll for my wife to live vicariously though. 

I can't stop thinking about when my daughter is a teenager. What if she doesn't like wearing dresses like I did at that age? Or doesn't want long hair or like getting her nails painted? Will wife make her feel bad for any of that? Like my daughter is less of a girl? And I can't stop picturing my daughter telling me she got her first period, then my wife getting upset daughter didn't tell *her* first, and making our daughter feel a little...not quite guilty because wife won't ever have a period or get pregnant assuming wife lets us talk freely about it instead of hiding it. God, I can't even ask her to pick up some tampons on her way home because it upsets her. 

As I keep think about it, I'm realizing I'd feel awkward with my wife sitting there sharing in this moment, just like I would have if my dad had been sitting there with me and my mom when we talked about it.  Uggghhh.  

 I hate my job, especially after what they pulled after my daughter was born, and I think my spouse will buy me quitting to go out of state -especially if I promise or at least imply that I'm down with her college plans and will get another job asap after I return. Wife pays daycare for our daughter out of her paycheck so I'm sure she'll be happy to not have to pay that while we're out of state. Son will miss the last six/seven weeks of school but that's okay. 

God, this won't be easy. I need to talk to my brother and a lawyer in this state and home state. My sister in law is very pregnant with twins, I'm sure my brother will be okay lying and saying they need me to come help them out and for the kids to come too to keep my nephew company."

1644,ThisIsNotShakira,"Men do have some milk ducts, and some mammary tissue, and *theoretically* they can produce milk - either due to taking drugs that induce lactation, or because it is a symptom of breast cancer, etc. 

However, so little is even really known about the components of women‚Äôs breast milk beyond we know that it has benefits for babies immune systems and so on beyond the colostrum stage (another example of how medicine ignores women for most part), that it is just negligent in my opinion to feed a baby male breast milk with so much unknown about its quality and how it compares to women‚Äôs breast milk. Also, women need to produce a LOT of milk for their babies (and if they can‚Äôt, the baby is at risk of being undernourished if they don‚Äôt switch to formula); I would be surprised if men can do that given they do have a lot less milk ducts and mammary tissue. Can you imagine one of these selfish men, like OPs husband, feeding a baby every 2-3 hours for half an hour or more around the clock? Or dealing with a baby not latching or needing to take an hour each time to get the amount the baby needs then getting an hour before having to go again?

Oh yeah, and then there is the whole they would be passing the drugs they need to induce lactation to the babies. It is all about the men‚Äôs fee fees, and not about the best interests or health of the child. 

A woman who was ‚Äústarving‚Äù her baby of milk and nutrients because she could not produce enough milk would be vilified; she is also often vilified if she switches to formula because of the same. But a man who can squeeze out some droplets of milk of uncertain quality - possibly contaminated with drugs - is so brave and stunning!

Women who haven‚Äôt given birth at all or not recently can also breastfeed by inducing lactation, though it can be easier if they have prior experience. Women used to act as milk nurses to other women‚Äôs babies (either as the mothers would not or could not breastfeed, of they were dead from childbirth/died during the child‚Äôs infancy). Sometimes the milk nurses would have to leave their own babies behind or undernourished to do this, or have even lost their own babies, but sometimes they either had no children or had them long ago, and were able to stimulate lactation with suckling, a baby‚Äôs cry, etc. Pre-formula, this was often the only chance a baby with a dead mother, or mother who could not feed, had."

So too can a man who claims he works harder than everyone.

I am with you, I find it incredibly bizarre when men ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù or won‚Äôt do laundry or wash dishes or any other chore. Maybe it‚Äôs because any man I have dated lived on their own at some point, and many came from single mother homes, but they have all been able to make the bed, do laundry, wash dishes, scrub toilets, etc. I have zero patience for men who believe their penis interferes with their ability to operate a washing machine.

Even worse than a man who won‚Äôt do their laundry is one who will *only* launder the clothes they wear and not the household stuff or kids laundry, too. No. 

Also can‚Äôt imagine why any grown man should need a ‚Äúchore chart‚Äù but on advice forums where women are looking for advice with a male partner not doing work around the house that seems to always be the overwhelming advice. I am pretty sure if I was living with a grown man where he needed a chore chart to do basic adulting like taking care of his habitat, I would not be sleeping with that man ever again.

I don‚Äôt say this to scare you or to have some witch hunt against your husband.

Your spouse is using you. You do the housework, you take care of the kids, you do the yardwork, you wash the dishes, you provide emotional support. Now you're about to have some money, and he wants that too.

He's a child who wants everything provided for him and everything to be catered to him so he can indulge this gender fantasy.

Your partner is self-absorbed and manipulative, and taking advantage of you. You accepted the behavior previously because he was a man doing things in male-socialized ways, and that was OK with you for whatever reason (no judgement).   


You're questioning because he's ""a woman"" now. You understand and have a community among women and female culture, but you KNOW women don't actually act that way unless they have other influences driving and changing them. We're socialized into gender roles even before birth much of the time because our sex is factual.    It would be great if we didn't live in a human society where gender roles and expressions were decided based upon sex, but the fact is, it happens. 


Your husband didn't lose his past and experiences and outlook when he transitioned, he just changed his perception of himself and demanded everyone else did as well. You're struggling because he's a man who is pretending to be a woman based on his misconceptions and biases, and you're trying to accept his non-truth while still being real to yourself.

1713,galit_,"First off, not a lawyer/this is not legal advice. That being said, you need to see a lawyer immediately. If you don't have the money for a lawyer, speak with your brother. This is one of those cases where unfortunately you stand to lose a lot more than what a lawyer might cost to retain. Do not tell anyone except your lawyer and trusted (and I mean *trusted*) family members what you're planning. Money always makes people go a bit crazy, but it gets worse when people have known about the money long enough to make plans for it. With only 6 months until your inheritance vests, you need to get a move on, and fast. Get out to see the lawyer as soon as you can.

There's a lot going on here, so try to carve out a few minutes for yourself tomorrow when you're feeling calm/relaxed (or as calm/relaxed as you're going to be) and jot down absolutely everything you can think of--these added expenditures, your incoming inheritance, whose name the credit card debt is under/whose card was used to rack it up, the timeline of transitioning (has your wife undergone surgery, changed sex markers on official documentation, etc.), what deadlines are impending, etc.--and where you want to go next. Write it all down, then walk away. On Sunday, pick it back up and go over it. Don't look at it when you're angry, because anger can cause you to start fudging facts without noticing. Just keep to facts for the most part.

Your lawyer may or may not need all the details you've included in your post; however, it's always best to walk into a meeting with a lawyer with everything written down on paper so that if you feel rushed or intimidated or overwhelmed etc. you can just refer down to what you've already written. Lawyers *love* organized clients. Organized clients are easy clients. Even if there's an uphill battle ahead of you (and I cannot guess at what will happen next; your lawyer will know far more so listen to them), being an easy client with an uphill battle is much better and easier to deal with than being a difficult client with a slam dunk case.

That being said, you don't need to bow and scrape and run for Ms Congeniality. You just need to show the lawyer that you take the situation seriously. Listen, ask questions when you don't understand something, and make sure you and the lawyer are on the same page before you leave the meeting. Take notes if you need/want to (I always take notes if only to keep my own written record of important meetings, but the lawyer should be taking notes of some kind as well if you forget) but whatever happens, leave knowing what you talked about and what the next steps are or would be (should you retain that lawyer). If you don't understand something, *ask*. Even if it only ends up being a consultation, and you end up with a different lawyer, still try to soak up everything you can.

Ultimately, you don't have much time to shop around, but you do have time to trust your gut. If anything seems off, thank them for their time and move onto the next. Above all else, trust in yourself. Transitioning does not make someone suddenly lose the ability to save money. Transitioning does not make your wife the centre of the universe. You have sacrificed so much for this marriage already. Please don't feel guilty for having the courage and sense to say you won't sacrifice anything more."

I've never experienced this, so take it with a grain of salt (and also perhaps consider approaching r/personalfinance but also take their words with a few grains of salt--these *are* just strangers on the internet, after all) but I think credit card debt might be one of those things that gets split 50/50 in a divorce unless you can extensively prove via receipts and such that it's all your wife/husband's doing.

You deserve a partner that contributes equally, wants you to be happy and values you and your children, their behavior makes me think that this wife will destroy you emotionally and financially and is using being trans as a defense and to manipulate you emotionally/financially."

She did agree pretty fast but that didn't stop her from talking about how it, and I (even indirectly), was invalidating to her. God, even now she's not putting the baby's needs first. I dress the kids in hardy play clothes so they can *play*, and that includes the youngest getting her brother's hand me downs. I'd rather my daughter be able to run around without having to worry about getting dirty and she's cute no matter what she's wearing. Wife does not agree. Wife wants daughter to be dressed up in cute clothing as much as possible, and will waste money buying pretty expensive stuff. Said stuff isn't conductive to playing, let alone playing in mud which is basically daughter's favorite thing to do. I'm pretty sure at one point my daughter has more clothes then I or my son did combined. If I try to talk to wife about it, I get a giggle and a ""I'm just making up for the childhood I never had!"" And if I push it, there's tears or she asks to be alone.  When I clean out daughter's dresser to donate too small stuff or things she won't wear, I always end up setting aside a good portion of the expensive stuff to consign regardless.

I would also be wary of him blowing big bucks on tuition, then not putting in the work to pass the classes and graduate).

Since it's obvious your spouse isn't going to put the kids first and is likely going to waste your money, do whatever it takes legal-wise so that you get ALL your money. I'm glad your brother is willing to help with a loan for an attorney. That money is your ticket to improving yourself and your life and therefore improving your kids' lives. This money will also allow you to get away from your spouse, which will also improve your kids lives.

1788,cheapsouvenir,"Three interesting points about the study at the NCBI link, which was co-authored by a trans activist:

1 - The father maxed at 227 grams per day, while most women produce around 500 grams per day by the time a baby's 5 days old. Some questions are therefore asked about claims that the pediatrician involved found the adopted baby adequately nourished for six weeks on nothing but the father's lactate.

2 - The man's lactate had not been assessed at the time the study was published so it's not known if it had the same mix of components as milk from new gestational mothers.

3 - The father's choice to ingest estrogen, progesterone, spironolacton, and domperidone had unknown effects on the baby. The FDA does not allow domperidone to be sold in the U.S. because it's caused serious heart problems, including fatal ones. The man in the study was able to obtain it because he lives in Canada where the drug remains on the market.

The Milk Junkies post concerns one case, not two. In it, the father, who also chose to pass domperidone and synthetic hormones to his baby through his lactate, reported that he was unable to produce more than a few droplets at the time of the birth, then found the baby couldn't latch on because his breast tissue and nipple couldn't reach the back of the baby's throat until the baby was older and stronger, and after that, nursed in tandem with his wife because neither of them was producing enough milk for the baby.

Of course. ‚óî_‚óîÔªø It's ""I am what I say I am"" until it turns ugly and it's suddenly 'fake trans'.

And yeah, you can wonder... but it'd be more helpful to point out why the story seems suspect. Considering that I have heard similar stories of abusive relationships between plain ol' boring men and their wives, I don't know what about this makes you suspicious."
1825,consider-thecoconut,"As I said, IN OTHER COMMENTS.

And you conveniently left out all the other parts of the OP that stated their partner did next to nothing before the transition, and now does even less because the more traditionally masculine roles ""trigger them""


""Despite her eagerly embracing the ""momma bear"" attitude since practically the first moment she told me she was trans, our child care and household chore duties have barely changed at all before and after transition. She still goes to the gym straight after work while I pick up the kids and go home to make dinner. Except now she's got a really cute gym bag and exercise outfits and sends me a cute selfie or two of herself while she's there.

She still gets home, eats dinner with us, then hangs out in the kitchen with me and the kids while I do the dishes and clean up. She tells me about her day. I like this part honestly, but I wish she would¬†help¬†because it would get done a lot faster if both of us were doing it.

She won't mow the lawn or do the outside chores any more -it gives her mental distress to do the household activities she did before she transitioned. So now I do all those in addition to most of the inside chores.""

Then OP put the comment you pasted where they talk about how they're still doing their partners laundry, as they always have,as an example of how they're still expecting her to do everything as it was before.

Also, OPs partner is technically a man regardless of whatever fantasies they have. I appropriately gendered their pre transition behavior, and was gender neutral discussing the rest which is more than what most people here to do so you're really arguing with the wrong person dude."

I hope you continue to find it helpful, partly because it will help make it clear that the trans issue is only the mask a narcissist is wearing, and partly to help you know the support you got here was not just a biased point of view. It will also arm you with clear thoughts as you free yourself from the abuse you are suffering. 

When you first meet a narcissist they approach their target with ""love bombing"" to create join up. They also mirror all the things you love and care about to help the bonding cement. Then they start the ""negging."" *(subtle negative comments to break down your self esteem so you will tolerate their abuse)* It may appear he was not always like this, but this doesn't develop as a personality disorder later in life. It's been there since early childhood. There can be things that cause it to be more intense as apposed to other times, like life's demands, but it's been there, hiding. They love to hook in sensitive, ethical people. People who will think long and deep before doing something like say... file for divorce. :p

And wants a baby just to play some BS motherhood fantasy instead of trying to connect with the children they already have??? 

Then there's also a huge correlation between sexual abuse in childhood and trans, and for men we see that a lot of those who were abused tend to do some abusing later on. So I'd be concerned with this person just bringing a bunch of random trans ppl to the house. Who knows what could happen.

Don't even bring the powertripping misogynistic TIM into this discussion. Make it clear that you don't understand what *HR* wants from you and you need clarification of it. If they blow it off and say you didn't have to leave (they were already trying to walk it back the night of), you still should try to make them put their reasoning for the request for your ""voluntary"" exit in writing.

TIMs are misogynistic powertrippers, so there's really no use in trying to fight this guy, especially since anyone with any power in the company will take his side. This issue is about HR discriminating against you on behalf of a misogynist coworker. The legal responsibility falls on HR, which means it's up to them to tell the TIM to pound sand. Your job, if you choose to accept it, is to make them fulfill their responsibility to you.

Interesting how the MAN afforded that courtesy to the MEN, but did not consider that maybe you had trans feelings but weren't ready to come out, and it's not her place to tell you what to wear.

Of course, this has everything to do with the fact that he knows if he complained to the men, they'd tell him to fuck off and might even laugh at him... but he feels that he has power over a woman, that his complaints might succeed with her, and that he won't face pushback for going after her.

And I've read way too many accounts from others who have been bullied and shut down because the only feelings which matter are the transwomen's. I'm sorry this happened to you. It's unfortunately much too common and it's way worse than just things like this. Reddit is infamous for shutting people down if they're ""on the wrong side"". (Although it isn't wrong at all). A lot of them, or their sympathizers, have taken over as mods on subs and you can get banned for saying totally innocent things. Or correct things. Or for just having an opinion. The bullying is pretty bad and really bad in real life. If you read around some, you'll see what I mean. There are sooooo many accounts of things that are changing or have been changed which hurt all natal women very badly. Definitely take the legal advice which has already been posted here. It's very good advice."

1930,FemmeRevolutionnaire,"I see on a pretty consistent basis that transwomen have a hell of a lot more privileges than ‚Äúcis female‚Äù women (a redundant phrase).  

I don‚Äôt mean privilege in just the sociological definition (which only means someone does not experience discrimination on a particular axis), but also in the sense that they get an unusual amount of special treatment. They are rarely expected to compromise, acquiesce, or face repercussions for inappropriate behavior. Your story is an all too common example, but there are a lot of egregious ones. 

Even other trans activists have said that Halloween is an opportunity for closeted people to safely experiment with their gender identity in public, so it‚Äôs best not to make assumptions about the intentions of cross dressers. How can they be sure you weren‚Äôt trying to explore being a trans man? That doesn‚Äôt mean I personally agree that it‚Äôs transphobic to cross dress for any other reason, but it‚Äôs pretty hypocritical of a trans person to police anyone else‚Äôs gender nonconformity. 

Anyway. Your coworker was 100% out of line. Their feelings are their responsibility alone, not yours or anyone else‚Äôs. You did nothing wrong, they were obligated to deal with their own discomfort without taking it out on you. If they couldn‚Äôt handle it like an adult, they should have left. 

It‚Äôs not the fault of cis women if a transwoman can‚Äôt pass, and it‚Äôs not our job to make sacrifices because they feel insecure about it. You don‚Äôt owe them anything more than the same basic courtesy you‚Äôd give to any other person. 

This applies to any well-adjusted adult in a professional setting, trans or not. Imagine going to HR and saying you want a co-worker to leave a Halloween party because she‚Äôs too attractive and it makes you feel insecure about your looks, or because she was talking about her recent engagement and it made you feel bad because you‚Äôre single. That‚Äôs how delusional and self-centered this person‚Äôs behavior sounds. It‚Äôs just that as a society we‚Äôre all so afraid of the extreme backlash that comes with alleged ‚Äútransphobia‚Äù that we‚Äôre conditioned to indulge their victim complex and constant need for attention."
1931,flabinella,"Yes it's a very weird world we are living in. And it's getting weirder every day.

Fact 2019: only in very few particular situations people are being expected to foresee any hurt their totally normal actions would cause and they are expected to tweak their behavior.

On the other hand, there are situations where it's totally okay to say or ask things that actually might cause hurt to people but all everyone says is: well get over it.

I will tell you some examples I experienced.

It's totally okay to ask a woman why she doesn't have children. Not only is this a totally personal issue, you might actually hurt someone who is infertile.

It's totally okay to make certain comments about women's bodies. You might never mention her race or the fact that she's overweight. But go ahead and ask her what her shoe size is if she's tall. And if she's slim go ahead and tell her that she should eat something. All perfectly accepted and it happens on a regular basis for me.

so go ahead and invade a woman's privacy, comment on her body and life choices, but don't dare to have a funny costume at an event!"

If a woman wears pants or a long sleeve shirt, it reminds TIM of how if xhe wore the same thing, xhe would be perceived as a man.

But first things first - while it is all still fresh in your mind and before you start worrying about hiring a lawyer and before facts get overwhelmed by feelings (which can happen, and it's normal) you need to sit down and write out everything that happened that night, every little detail.

Where did you get dressed for the party? Were you alone or with other people? Describe your costume in *exact* detail (photos would be great.) How did you get to the party? What time did you arrive? Do you remember talking to specific people about your costume or anyone else's costumes? Write it all down. When did you notice the men dressed as female characters? What *exactly* where *they* wearing? How were they acting (i.e. were they just being themselves but in costume, or was 'Harley Quinn' acting like the female character Harley Quinn?) 

When did you first notice Sarah was present/when did he arrive? What time was it and what were you doing when Sarah and 'HR' pulled you aside to talk about your costume? Write out the conversation as best as you can remember it. Did anyone else hear the conversation? (If so, ask them to write down what they recall.) What was the tone of the conversation? 

>At that point HR told me she can't make me leave, but that Sarah had been crying in the bathroom earlier and that it would mean a lot if I just left for the night.  
>  
>So I said my goodbyes and left, but I cried in the Uber home.

All the details of this - what was the tone of 'it would mean a lot if you just left for the night?' Did you feel that some negative consequence (other than Sarah's feelings being hurt) would happen to you if you chose to stay? When you said your goodbyes and left, what did you say? Did any of your co-workers know why you were leaving? If they didn't, did they ask why you were leaving early? What did you say? Where was Sarah and ""HR"" while you were saying these goodbyes? What time did you leave? Ask your friends/co-workers who stayed at the party - when did the party end? What time did Sarah leave? How did she seem (mood, etc.) after you left? What time did the men dressed as women leave? **This part is important -** were any work projects, upcoming work social events, or other important work-related conversations you would have been part of had you been able to stay talked about at the party after you left? (This is where damages start applying.)

*Why* did you cry on the way home? Was it just because you had been looking forward to the party, was it because it felt unfair, was it because you hadn't meant to hurt anyone's feelings, was it because you didn't feel you got to state your side of things, was it because the cross-dressing men could stay, was it because you felt accused of transphobia or being disrespectful/hurtful when that wasn't the case, was it because you were worried about the consequences with HR going forward, or some combination of these (or other) things? 

Write down everything you remember, times, people, transport modes, everything, and if you have co-operative coworkers, let them help. 

Your next step should be to write a simple email to HR. *You need to write a simple wording of events that is basically impossible for them to deny.* Leave out details they could say didn't happen or are exaggerations - just the simple truth. 

This is an example, but it might not be right for you (include *only* facts they cannot deny or 'spin,' even better if you can name witnesses who heard the conversation or saw you forced to leave.)

'I am writing re: the events of the evening of (party date), when \[HR person\] told me it was best for me to leave the company party because my costume was upsetting to another co-worker, Sarah, because I was a 'cis woman' dressed as a male character. This happened even after I explained that my costume was simply a favourite character of mine, that I did not intend to hurt anyone's feelings, and after I pointed out that two men at the party were dressed as female characters. Those men were *not* asked to leave. This incident was distressing to me, and I would like to put it on the record. I have testimony from two other co-workers who \[heard the discussion where I was asked to leave, saw me leaving the party in tears, whatever is true.\] If you do not agree with my accounting of this event, I would appreciate a detailed reply indicating exactly where you feel my recollection, and the recollection of my co-workers, is not accurate.""

This will put them on notice that you're thinking lawsuit, so be careful, but make it airtight and basically impossible for them to deny. It should only be a few sentences long (your detailed write-up of the night may be pages long - keep that for *your* lawyer, don't show it to HR.)

Don't start looking for a lawyer until you have written out every detail you remember, quietly enquired if any co-workers can vouch for any of what you're saying occurred (I mean *any* of it - even if someone just remembers you left suddenly and unexpectedly, that's good, ask them to write down what they remember.) Then once you have your written statement, any corroborating statements, and a response from HR to your undeniable facts, go find that lawyer and *please* crucify your employer, because what happened to you is not okay. (I might think differently if the men in 'cross-dress' were also asked to leave, but they weren't? That's some bullshit right there.)"
2025,marilynspolitics,ACLU and HRC are both very pro-trans. Try find representation that will treat you fairly.
2026,TAgurl,"Yes, yes, yes! Legal advice pronto!

My mind raged upon reading this account. I immediately started rationalising the situation with regards to HR work policies for clothing etc. I know it‚Äôs confronting to be put on the spot in this scenario, but unless HR can show definitive documentation that clearly outlines where OP had contravened any said policy, it was completely unacceptable to suggest, even in an ‚Äòunofficial‚Äô capacity (and regardless of how oh, so politely it was couched) that she leave the party.

In this instance OP, YOU were clearly singled out and discriminated against. 

Be clear when recounting the reason they gave you for suggesting you leave. What language did they use and how did they use it? Was the reasoning they gave sound, with regards to your behaviour? The obvious answer is no. 

They kicked you out just to appease someone else‚Äôs sensibilities - someone you had zero direct contact with that night. Nobody else found your costume offensive up to that point, so don‚Äôt let them pull that card on you either. 

Remember OP to also highlight that you immediately tried to calmly resolve this issue and brought to their attention the blatant discrimination between your being asked to leave, and the verbal response you were given for why the cross-dressing men didn‚Äôt have to.

Was it even acceptable for a representative of HR to approach you in this casual manner? What‚Äôs the policy for this? It was essentially an ambush, for which you had zero time to prepare for, let alone accept. 

Good luck!"
2027,TrueIsntSafe,"Seconding the stay away from the ACLU opinion. They have fully drunk the trans Kool-Aid.

Step 1 is to document everything. OP should start a folder in her home. For each incident, jot down names, dates, places, witnesses, people she talked to after the fact, and copies of any key documents. Now that the TIM has had a taste of exercising shame and ostracism powers over a female coworker and HR has backed him up on it, the crybullying is going to ramp up. 

It won't necessarily be aimed at OP again, and probably not against 67-year-old Marie. But woe to McKenzie who sits next to the TIM and has the temerity to be pregnant in his presence, or Molly who needs extra accommodation for her endometriosis, or Megan who dares tell her work besties about her PCOS or TTC struggles.

Step 2 is for OP to pull out her employee handbook. Familiarize herself with company policy on reporting a hostile work environment incident. Even though the party wasn't typical 9-5 work, it's still corporate enough.

Step 3 is to make some tough choices about whether and how to actually report. 

If OP is going for a lawyer, she should look for a local plaintiff's employment discrimination lawyer. If she's in the US, it may be a little early to find a lawyer who will take the case on a no-money-up-front contingent fee, but it might be worth her time to seek an initial consultation on the hostile work environment. Just depends on how hungry the local sharks are.

If OP can't find a lawyer at this early phase - or she just doesn't want to - she needs to decide whether she wants to risk an internal corporate complaint. On the one hand, doing this promptly and by the book makes it harder for them to undermine her timing and motives if it ever does get to litigation. On the other, only OP has a sense of what kind of retaliation is likely to blowback on her for being 'difficult'.

In any event, OP should probably leave the GC/QT/TRA politics out of it. Unless her lawyer tells her otherwise, continue to play along with the TIM's pronouns, etc. For now, this is just about a double standard for male and female staff, and being singled out as 'inappropriate' with inadequate advance warning or justification."

Trans issue aside, this was a clear example of sex discrimination. OP was held to a standard that her male co-workers were not simply because ONE person didn't like her costume.

2140,4eyedPurplePPLeater,"Cis is supposed to mean your gender identity matches your body/ sex. But going by their own doctrine, assuming a person's gender identity is a bad thing. Therefore, assuming you're cis & have cis privilege, goes against gender ideology.... yet it happens all the time because rampant hypocrisy thrives in this movement.      

Gender pertains to roles, stereotypes, & expectations, that are nothing but a social construct, enforced by a patriarchal society. Gender has been a powerful tool used to oppress women -- by claiming we are ""cis"", they are claiming we are not only walking stereotypes, but that we willingly identify with our oppression... not very progressive is it?       

That's why gender identity is harmful. For it to exist, they expect a portion of people to fit into this narrow definition of what a man or woman is. We know no one does, so going by gender logic, everyone should technically be ""non binary"" or ""trans"", because no one is a walking stereotype.      

If everyone could qualify as having a different ""gender identity"" from their sex, then it shows why the whole concept is flawed. They choose to believe in these regressive sexist stereotypes, & tell people their body must be wrong, rather than seeing the problem is with having that mentality in the first place.

EXACTLY!

The logical solution would be to send the TiM home. If he's so delicate that something as simple as a woman dressing up as a male Batman villain causes him to run screaming to HR and cry ""DYSPHORIA!!"", than he's clearly too sensitive for Halloween.

&#x200B;

Also, as others have pointed out, where does this end? If this TiM can command HR to send a woman home for wearing a tuxedo to a party (without the makeup, most TwoFace costumes are just normal tuxedos), can he also send one home during a normal workday because she wore a ""masculine"" pantsuit to the office and it triggered him? What if a very butch woman comes to work there and seeing her go about her day in masculine clothes, no makeup, and short hair causes him to have a breakdown? Will HR then be compelled to tell the butch woman she's required to wear skirts and makeup to the office because it would make the trans person less sad? It's INSANE to allow one person to have this much power over their co-workers. 

&#x200B;

I can't help feeling just a little sorry for the HR rep in this story. I imagine HR was in a bind because, in this climate, if you say ""no"" to a transgender person (especially a TiM) or imply that they might be over reacting to something silly (like a goddam Halloween costume) you'll likely be in for a PR nightmare that could destroy your business.

Then email your story to yourself (and a trusted friend, or your mom or sister or whatever) so it's dated and timed. Then print it out, seal it in an envelope, mail it to yourself, and after you receive it in the mail keep it sealed - the postmark is your proof of when you wrote it (this is a common thing in copyright cases, it works just as well for 'witness testimony') You can unseal it in court or arbitration if it comes to that. 

If you know what happened, you can describe the timeline, and especially if you have any witnesses (if they heard the 'you should leave' conversation, amazing, but even if they just noticed you leaving suddenly and unexpectedly and remember the cross-dressing men staying on, that's damn good)  you are in a strong position and HR should be quaking in their boots... details, every little detail.

Even if the case is successful, all an employer needs to do is axe any ""woman"" dress codes & make a policy,  (for ex) that all employees need to wear neutral colored pants & a button up.

Basically, your body says 'I'm exhausted from the internal bullshit and can't deal with any external nonsense'. You literally, physically can't deal with crap anymore. I wish it felt better physically, but it's really kind of freeing.

(it‚Äôs illegal to record without permission in differing jurisdictions). Generally, the burden of proof will always fall on to you if there is no other evidence.

Doing so, I‚Äôve had decisions made against me/my actions from years past overturned or abolished, and this includes fines or supposed multiple debts (which were proved to be incorrect). I could do this only because I keep detailed records. 

This may seem extreme, but how many times for instance, have people been verbally told something by a utility company only to receive a bill where you‚Äôve been charged for something outside of what you thought were agreed terms. If you contact them and challenge them on this, they typically claim ignorance or error, so bad luck for you.

2212,muffinsrising,"Wow this was a ride. When I was searching for this article I came across [a similar one posted to reddit](http://np.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/6luvs1/man_who_identifies_as_6year_old_dominates/) about a man dominating a kids crossfit class. One of the comments referred to the article saying that the man 'didn't identify' as someone who was taking growth hormones, and mentioned that this should be a standard response to a PED's accusation.

&#x200B;

I [googled PED](https://www.floelite.com/articles/6225210-emily-abbott-fails-ped-test-is-barred-from-crossfit-games) because I didn't know what it stood for: Performance-Enhancing Drug test. That article lists women who have been sanctioned for failing the test. 2nd on the list is a woman banned for using ""clomiphene - selective estrogen receptor modulator"".

&#x200B;

[Clomiphene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomifene) is primarily prescribed to treat female infertility by stimulating ovulation (for example, women with PCOS). It stimulates GnRH release, which upregulates sex hormone production and inhibits receptors for estrogen in the brain that would turn 'off' the signal. As a result, the hypothalamus perceives the body to have low estrogen, and upregulates gonadotropin (FSH and LH) production. These stimulate the ovaries to produce more estrogen. As ovary follicles develop they in turn produce more estrogen. It works for infertility because high estrogen is needed at that phase of the cycle to get a follicle to rupture for ovulation.

&#x200B;

Clomiphene is banned by the [World Anti-Doping Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_drugs_banned_by_WADA). So females can't use drugs to increase their estrogen production as a treatment for PCOS and infertility, but TiMs can pop all the estrogen that pleases them without regulation to treat their genderfeels. Women aren't allowed to mess with their natural estrogen hormone levels, not even when they have a serious medical condition... so much for ""transwomen are women""."

2251,WotNoKetchup,"It's great how trans get to police what a dysphoria is and isn't?

In a previous study, it was suggested that the experience of blood donation was also gendered, that for male donors it was ‚Äòjust a product‚Äô while for women blood donation formed a relationship with the recipient (Waldby et al. 2004).

 However, in the plasma products industry, male plasma has historically been more highly sought after and valued because it is perceived as a less ‚Äòrisky‚Äô product than plasma from women. 

Two examples demonstrate how gender operates as an organising principle in blood and plasma processing. 

First, in the UK since 2003, a policy of ‚Äòmale donor preference‚Äô has been adopted meaning that all women's plasma obtained through blood donation is usually discarded (i.e. unless there is a shortage of male plasma) because it is associated with a potentially higher incidence of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) attributed to high levels of antibodies following pregnancy. 

The reproductive potential of women's bodies impacts on how they are understood as blood and plasma donors: women are identified as potentially being or having been pregnant at the point of donation and thus at risk of adversely affecting the recipients of their donated plasma. Women are thus constructed as more risky bodies and the maternal body as representing a threat to blood and plasma product safety"

I'll never forget looking through Sailor Moon DVDs when I was 12 (and looked even younger), and this grown man with a purse came over and started talking to me in a silly girly voice about the characters.

I heard of therapy with antidepressants + neuroleptics, but it's also harmful just because of the nature of these drugs (not sure what it does in relation to dysphoria symptoms, haven't looked into it much) + I don't hear about it much, maybe it's only used in some countries."

Because if it was the genres or certain shows themselves, the populations most affected by it would be Japan & other East Asian nations. They aren‚Äôt though.

It‚Äôs clear and proven that ‚Äútransitioning‚Äù does not work or improve outcomes for patients, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs any interest in pursuing research for other treatment options. Since being trans is highly correlated with issues like autism and cluster b personality disorders, esp narcissism, maybe an option is to somehow treat it similarly to how those conditions are managed? Most trans patients have a litany of other mental health issues, and I think in order for any treatment to be truly effective, they need to also treat all the concurrent issues as well."
2393,jazman1867,"And while I'll agree with it having an influence I don't believe watching anime makes one trans.  I'm of the though that during our early and teenage years we're very confused to how and who we are in the world and some of us have a very hard time fitting in.  We seek out things that help us make sense of the world and especially nowadays it's very easy to find other like minded individuals.  Problem is when we surround ourselves with like minded others it tends to make a feed back loop (echo chamber) and we start to reinforce our ideas and those ideas become facts.

I've been watching anime since I was 7 and I'm now 41 and yes as a teen I wasn't sure how I fit in the world and I even though that I might be gay.  It wasn't because I watched anime or cartoons, it was because of how much I couldn't relate to others and how much I didn't fit in the 'proper mold' of what my sex was supposed to be."

No one should be watching loli anyways or anything similar. Yaoi, yuri are meh but can cause ""pathological"" mishaps in one form or another.

Anything viewed can cause someone with mental issues to have some kind of mental break, hell there are furry fgs running around because they think they are animals.

2434,Palgary,"I studied Japanese in college because I really like Japanese Music and Sci-Fi anime.  I also really liked that they had literature (manga) aimed specifically at women.  Japanese people are very stoic, so their media and music tends to be melodramatic/full of emotion.  I come from a stoic background and we're the same way - music is really melodramatic and a socially appropriate way to release emotions.  However, I got over wanting to ever visit or live there because Japan is so hugely sexist and racist.  Women only have the right to vote because Americans wrote it into the constitution after WWII.  

To be fair - I think we used to only get the best, more analytical/sci fi Anime, and now we get all the garbage too.

*Aggretsuko* is a pretty good Anime about what it's like to be a young woman in Japan today, navigating independence and a career vs getting married with Sanrio-like characters.  The main character lets off steam by going to Karaoke and singing death metal."

2450,less_racist_account,"Female anime characters are designed specifically to either be an overtly sexualized characterization of an adult woman or an overtly infantilized child with the features of a toddler. The avatars TIM's have are either one of these, the way they feel most comfortable being perceived and feel is closest to their identity is either as a child or a mockery of being a woman. Picking a young looking anime avatar is no better than the other choice because of a lack of ""sexualized perception of the inner self"" - it implies expression of feminity is either sexual or infantile. There is clearly a connection with how anime girls are designed and portrayed and TIM's views of women, if it comes down to not wanting to use pictures of real women there are tons of other art mediums depicting women. A lot of my friends use pictures of women from live-action shows or video games, because they're characters they respect. Personally, I've always just used images I find funny or interesting looking, probably stemming from the fear of retaliation/being treated differently by announcing I'm a woman on the internet. Saying TIM's use anime pictures because of a lack of any other choices to properly express themselves is a complete bullshit argument."

It's an interesting hypothesis that autistic people show high levels of interest in anime beacuse of simple facial expressions but it's way more likely that autistic people just show interest in topics in a way that other people don't and since anime is extremely popular among young people it makes sense that a lot of people on the spectrum would be exposed to it as well."

A quick exploration of the art tag on tumblr or Twitter shows this. TIM's are ""allowed"" to do whatever they want, but there's justifiable criticism in them relating to infantile or sexualized drawings over literally anything else. There is offense in anime girls being chosen as the easiest way to identify yourself as female, it shows a serious problem in the way feminity is perceived and using it as the end all to be seen as a verifiable woman propagates that idea. Literally a jpeg of a pink heart as an avatar would be read as female by anyone. Relating to an anime girl clearly goes deeper than just wanting to be seen as a woman.

There is no robust, international, definition of transition - currently the gender fascists are clear that you a) need to transition medically; b ) need only take ""cross sex"" hormones, c) change your outward apparel (and if you feel the need, your hair), and d) just need to announce your pronouns.

I mod 3 discord servers, and I'm not trans. My brother mods 2, and a minecraft server, and he's basically a damn computer addict at this point, and yet he's not trans either.  The majority of young people are active online, and a small subset of those are trans. It's not the cause of it."
2506,relaxilla420,Not really. Magical girl animes are still very popular. The most popular animes right know have to do with super heroes.

There are a billion factors that go into it, as there are likely a bunch of factors that made *you* unlikely to experience 'GD' despite your time spent. But I don't think it's as bizarre as you're making it out to be to hypothesize that greater time spent --> greater 'modern' e-savviness --> greater likelihood to stumble upon trans hangouts and trans porn --> greater likelihood to self-apply those concepts.

2521,DuckingWrong,"It started with anime, but I was never a huge fan myself. My friends were though so I drew lots of stuff for them. The first time I drew something that could be considered porn was my friend literally laying on top of Ash Ketchum.. very juvenile lol didn't know what sex actually entailed. That didn't last long. I found this obscure japanese game online and thought wow such cute characters! It wasn't anime, just a game. I quickly found all the japanese blogs (or whatever personal websites were called in 1999) about their romantic and sexual relationships between these vague characters with little background. So that was my intro to it back when nobody in middle school knew wtf yaoi was. It escalated quickly to dysphoria and my first suicide attempt the next year. No idea why it's so prevalent."
2522,vanillamasala,"I‚Äôm pretty sure some of those journals I linked in my previous comment talk about trans culture on the internet, like Tumblr and all, which are probably mentioned in the paper... they are just approaching it from a variety of angles. 

There are certainly some anime/trans related papers, but I don‚Äôt know any that would claim so boldly that any one thing definitely ‚Äúmakes‚Äù someone trans. This seems more like a graduate seminar topic where people might gather a great deal of related papers and read/debate them at length, drawing conclusions about each paper separately and what they might mean in relationship to one another. 

Probably papers and articles like these:

They ban shoes, but dont ban testosterone?

They hate that men are stronger, faster etc. But like doesn't mean women aren't powerful beings, we give birth, life for Christ's sake. I'm so sick of men and boys being in our sports, winning our medals, and going to our competitions. It's disgusting and atrocious they would allow something like this. Props to Idaho for waking TF up already. Just because you have a feeling doesn't mean it's factual. Femenist need to fight for our spaces and places in society. Women don't have dicks period, genitals matter to gender and sex. I'm so sick of gender being on every news article, get a MF break already."
2549,randomleaver123,Dang just subbed to this and thought this was on the r/all front page. :(
2550,ChurnerMan,"To be fair the IOC do limit testerone to 10 nanomales per litre which is only about 20x more than the average woman, but half the normal man. The IAAF which governs track and field reduced their limit to 5 and had to defend it in court which they won back on May 1, 2019.

I don't think XYs or even intersex people should be competing against XX, but if you're going to use testerone even 5 is way too high. If a woman (XX) was over 2.5 she would likely be under the care of a doctor because it be a sign of other health issues. 

I think we'll get back to the point where people throw their hands up and demand XX for female competitions, but it's going to a masculine looking XY claiming a gold medal on the world stage."
2551,WomanBornGirl,"Totally. I was explaining the whole situation to a man a few weeks ago, and he did the devil's advocate nonsense (as in:
him: ""okay, so you think trans people shouldn't be allowed to compete at all?""... 
me: um, not really. Competing is not a human right. 
him: ""oh, true. so how about if trans people compete in their own league?"" 
me: sure, whatever. 
him: ""but wait, weren't there girls who were excluded from a sport for having naturally high testosterone levels?"" 
me: YES! DOESN'T THAT SUGGEST, INHERENTLY, THAT IF A WOMAN CAN BE EXCLUDED FOR THAT, THEN MALES SHOULD BE EXCLUDED COMPLETELY?""  Sorry for the tangent, but excluding slightly elevated testosterone in natal women but not excluding natal males reminds me of your excluding-shoes-but-not-males anecdote. FFS!"
2552,millenially_ill,"I agree that the fact that we‚Äôve gotten to the point where we have to have a law for this is insanity. However, I‚Äôm happy to see that  society is beginning to step up to protect girls from the ridiculousness that has been brewing. I really hope we‚Äôre starting to shift back to using logic. I think people are starting to get really tired of the transcult bs - and even though they‚Äôre terrified to speak out publicly they‚Äôre privately casting their vote."
2553,JohnnyJohnson11,"IMO, if you transition, you give up your right to compete. Plan and simple."
2554,sosorreal,"True. I'm on the left and this is such a pain point in discussions. People think I'm some horrible person because I won't submit to the trans ideology.

2555,McBurger,"This article is so terribly written.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I support the content - but what lousy journalism.  It reads more like someone‚Äôs ranting opinion piece.

Just the other week someone posted on here wondering why so many far-right posters started flocking to this sub.

2569,MichaelGCu,"Even more insane, trans activists and their allies are going to fight these laws keeping TIMs out of women‚Äôs sports with every thing they have.  Hope this is the beginning of the end for the psychotic cult."
2570,Manaxium,"Which shouldn‚Äôt even be controversial. Transitioning means giving up a lot of things, professional sports is just one of them. It‚Äôs entitlement plain and simple to ask the world to bend over backwards to allow you to do whatever you want. It‚Äôs unfortunate, but not as unfortunate as asking women who have trained their entire lives to be the best of the best of their sex-segregated leagues to risk life and limb to appease your unfortunate circumstance."
2571,Svetlana_Banana,Or the TIMs can compete against other men.
2572,WomanBornGirl,YES
2573,Sophiexc,"Agreed. Not questioning the motives behind the trans movement isn't ""wokeness,"" it is willful ignorance."
2574,Environmental_East,Libfems have let TRAs dominate feminism. It‚Äôs a liberal issue. I say this as a leftist.
2575,TotesEpicRealFemale,"I totally get where you're coming from - but from where I am, it looks like queer theorists have taken control of the left in America. Gender ideology and leftism is a trope at this point. A significant amount of time and money is spent on pandering to a tiny portion of our population"
2576,terf_fret,But the left is doing this. They've brought it upon us. We have to face this fact. Especially since it feels our own parties are turning on women.
2577,Spirited-Wrongdoer,"The right's reasons for resistance against TRA's is very different from radical feminism's reasons for resistance against TRA's. Their central ideology is not centered around protecting women, women's bodily autonomy, and women's safety. They might shroud their hatred as concern for women, but they've shown with their policies and actions that their stances are rooted in hatred and ignorance.

Radical feminism denounces TRA ideology not because we are afraid of change or because we are inherently hateful. We resist TRA ideology because it functions as an extension of misogyny. Talk about misogyny to a right leaning person, and they'll roll their eyes at you. They're not our allies just because they post negative content about transgenderism."
2578,Nickels4Tickles,But it isn't a bipartisan issue in US politics. The conservative party uses this as an excuse for bigotted rhetoric against LGB people but isn't legislating against women's protections and rights to their own spaces (however happy they are to strip a woman's right to control what happens with her own body). But every presidential candidate of the liberal party supports legislation that would destroy women's spaces.
2579,just_a_quick_nitpick,"Agreed, in UK, both people in the labour and the tories are pushing the replacement of sex based rights with gender based rights. 

So it's a bit more complicated than liberals with conservatives."
2580,ABLovesGlory,"You have no leaders who agree with you, then. Every democratic candidate supports ""trans rights""."
2581,HorridlyMorbid,"Even though I'm not like that, I have always preferred states like that. The people and culture tend to be very reserve and more relatable to introverts like me."
2582,Manaxium,"Seriously, even from a pro-trans participation slant 5 is way too high. My testosterone is nearly undetectable after only 6 months of monotherapy. They‚Äôre basically allowing doping no matter how you spin it.

I don‚Äôt think most trans women would even consider testosterone at that level acceptable. Makes you wonder how dysphoric these TIMs really are."
2583,Manaxium,It‚Äôs funny because I can remember China and Russia being accused of sneaking men into their women‚Äôs teams and it was widely regarded as cheating. Tie a trans rights bow around it and suddenly it‚Äôs bigotry to question fairness or safety with males competing with females.
2584,ChurnerMan,"Exactly why I'm in favor of an xx category. It's a mistake to engage in their delusion and believe that they can actually become women with enough drugs and surgeries.  The xx category doesn't allow any gray area on the types of athletes in the category.

On semi related note I always found it weird that the hive mind on r/2xchromosomes was very trans supportive when most of these people are xy trying to pretend to be xx."
2585,notcisjustwoman,I think that the vast majority don't realize that Semenya is male because it's been tiptoed around so much.
2586,SecretsOfSurvival,Or against each other
2587,JohnnyJohnson11,"Or that. It's just unfair for women to have to compete with, not only a body with testosterone, BUT an athlete that used to be the opposite sex. Or gender, or whatever the fuck is politically correct. Non binary fuckin shit whatever"
2588,WomanBornGirl,Agreed.
2589,DorianGreysPortrait,"Exactly, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying all these posts about ‚Äòliberals‚Äô and ‚Äòconservatives‚Äô don‚Äôt have a place on a bipartisan issue."
2590,baby--bunny,"Most conservative people I know personally (myself included) feel pretty similarly to most people here regarding LGB vs T issues. I don't know anyone who has issues with anyone being gay including my elderly relatives. The attitude is pretty much ""It's not hurting anyone, who cares"" but are very against controversial trans issues because they *are* hurting people. Transitioning kids, letting men in women's spaces, etc."
2591,Julzlex28,"We are talking about policy in the United States, however."
2592,DorianGreysPortrait,"That‚Äôs all well and good.. but just the other week someone posted on here wondering why so many far-right posters started flocking to this sub.

2593,thekeeper_maeven,I get it. I think I would be more comfortable in a purple state. Hard to say for sure. I just like it more when people are actually exposed in their day to day lives with opposing views and learn how to actually deal with that.
2594,BrynhildsPyre,"> I don‚Äôt think most trans women would even consider testosterone at that level acceptable.

I'm sure that's true, but unfortunately there are enough mediocre failed male athletes who suddenly find meaning in beating down women that without regulation they won't be kept away. And I also wonder how dysphoric they really are, or if they are just misogynists who hate women so much they feel the need to show the world that they can do ""woman"" better."
2595,Manaxium,"It‚Äôs fucking depressing that you have to specify xx at all. Women are women, trans women are trans women, what‚Äôs the freaking issue? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2596,Manaxium,"It‚Äôd be so much less confusing if trans people were just considered (and considered themselves) a third sex, instead of trying to claim they‚Äôve crossed over from one to the other. Sex-segregated spaces for three sexes wouldn‚Äôt leave anyone out and wouldn‚Äôt hurt anyone, and would ensure the continued sanctity of women‚Äôs spaces. Not to mention it‚Äôd just make it easier for people to talk about and wrap their minds around.

But no, they‚Äôd rather talk about feminine dicks and masculine vaginas. ü§Æ"
2597,Spirited-Wrongdoer,"Like the other person on this thread said, I guess I'm confused with your use of the term bipartisan issue. It's important to make sure that we are careful who we are aligning ourselves with when we champion our causes.

I'm saying labeling someone conservative does have a place in this issue because if they are conservative, I won't be able to appeal to them from a GC perspective when I'm talking about issues relating to transgenderism.

It matters to me when someone is conservative. It matters to me in making sure that in my feminism I am not blind to the issues related to race, immigration, war and poverty."
2598,Julzlex28,"A bipartisan issue is generally used to talk about how the Senate and House of Reps vote along party lines, not opinions of the general population. So as someone said this isn't a bipartisan issue. Literally every leftist/ liberal/ Democrat politician has come out in support of this issue. It is deep in both mainstream and not so mainstream leftist circles. In fact the left has made this about liberal and conservatives by slamming any liberal who criticizes trans ideology as being in bed with the right. They have absolutely surrended  mainstream political criticism of trans ideology to homophobic, racist, classist conservatives. So YOU as a liberal may be critical of trans ideology, but that is not reflected in leftist political circles with power, or is it reflected in their policy making. And they will have egg on their face when it backfires and seems like conservatives are on the right side of history - even if it is for the wrong reasons."
2599,GCsaltofthearth,Yup. This.
2600,,[deleted]
2601,Nickels4Tickles,"Radfems shouldn't blindly support a political ideology that is often pro-porn, pro-""sex work"", and pro-self-ID just because people will accuse us of being alt-right. The Democratic Party platform is a real danger to women who already have very little agency in our current system. No woman should trust a party that chases after woke points at the expense of female prisoners who will be raped by mentally ill men."
2602,Julzlex28,"But this is ""those damn liberals."" It is unfortunate that right-wingers are coming over here, but we cannot pretend that trans policy isn't being passed almost exclusively by liberals in the United States. It is the Democrats, not the Republicans, utterly pandering to and accepting trans ideology. Just look at Elizabeth Warren.

Perhaps the mods, who do a good job, can be one the look out for right-wingers. But I believe they already are. I am not going to not hold liberals accountable for their utter betrayal of women just because some lost right-wingers wonder over here. No matter how you talk about politics your going to attract people you don't like. It's how you deal with it, and I am not going with the falsehood that in the United States this is a bipartisan issue.

Liberals need to face the music."
2603,Manaxium,"There are so many depraved and ill people in the world. Makes it seem a given that there will be abuse if males are allowed to compete with women. Oftentimes the kind of people to be so dedicated to Olympic sports are people who desire their moment in the spotlight and their legacies. Seems obvious that some, especially with exacerbating comorbidities, would see value in sacrificing being male if it means they will be noticed both for their superior fitness ‚Äúas a woman‚Äù and be made a topic due to being a trans woman.

The stakes are high. If it‚Äôs allowed to continue I feel it is inevitable that someone is going to take it too far in competitive sport and a woman is going to end up dead.

It is **so** irresponsible to put a fully grown man and woman in a ring together and say ‚Äúdo your worst‚Äù. The power disparity, despite the attempts to discredit the truth about how HRT affects athletes, is enormous.

One way or another, it‚Äôs going to be noticed and people are going to react. The backlash is looming."
2604,ChurnerMan,I know as I was writing it I realized they stole the word. They can't steal XX though... at least I hope not.
2605,baby--bunny,"Just speaking about the majority of conservative individuals that I know personally, but then again I don't many people who blindly follow their party  and agree with every stance."
2606,WomanBornGirl,"Yeah, I feel uncomfortable calling myself ""liberal"" at all now. And no one has ever heard of radical feminism, so I don't even know how to explain what I am anymore. I loathe MRA and TRA and ""choice feminism"" and anyone who is deluded enough to think prostitution is a choice for the prostituted. Yet, no on on the right agrees with me on anything else... When I meet someone, I usually start with ""who hates Trump?!"" and then take it from there, issue by issue, to see how much common sense we have in common."
2607,BrynhildsPyre,Well put. I think this year's Olympics will be a peak trans moment for quite a lot of the world.

They were also holding up ‚ÄúPROTECT TRANS KIDS‚Äù signs or something like that... like alright... you keep on protecting children by advocating that whatever they say about themselves is true, messing around with their puberty and hormones and sterilizing them, doing god knows what to their healthy genitalia and rendering them pretty much unable to ever experience sexual pleasure, turning them into ‚Äúdrag kids‚Äù and exposing them to degenerate kinks and fetishes at the pride parade, in schools, in libraries, and in the media...

There is nothing stopping the TIM participating in powerlifting for fun. Why do they act as if they have a right to compete, when in their own division they wouldn't have ever had a chance due to being mediocre?

What about the women athletes' desire to compete, which the TIMs infringe on?

Also: ""trans athletes should be celebrated fiercely"".

No they shouldn't. Why should they? Why should mediocre men be celebrated at all when competing with women? It's the women pushing the capabilities of their body that ought to be celebrated, bit some enourmous awkward-looking blook with long hair who fancied a go 18 months ago.

>	Removal of Testosterone today does not remove the advantages of Testosterone in the past.

>	Although it is clear that reducing T to female levels does reduce current muscle size and red blood cell levels in males, it does not reverse the impact that T had during puberty. Puberty and early adulthood was when the size and shape of the male body was formed. It is well known that males are larger, have longer limbs, a larger rib cage with larger organs like heart and lungs, bigger hands, their legs are more vertical due to a narrow pelvis, the list goes on. The male body is optimised for physical performance. In contrast, in females there is an evolutionary trade-off between physical performance and the ability to bear children.

>	Future advantage due to muscle memory:
There is considerable scientific evidence now that muscles built under the influence of Testosterone will be easier to build in the future even in the absence of Testosterone. Links HERE, HERE. ‚ÄòMuscle memory‚Äô means that if an elite athlete takes performance-enhancing drugs, they may continue to be at an advantage over their competitors even if they stop taking the drugs. This is why elite athletes can have their titles removed retrospectively if they are later found to have taken performance enhancing drugs at any point in the past (not just at the time the title was acquired).

>Therefore it is likely that male-born transgender athletes who once trained under the influence of natural testosterone will forever be at an advantage over female-born competitors never exposed to such high T levels. Read an excellent short review on this topic HERE.

>	Even low levels of male-competitive advantage will dramatically change sporting outcomes.

>Suppression of Testosterone by male-born transgender athletes undoubtedly reduces their athletic performance. However, the key question is ‚Äòby how much?‚Äô It is highly likely that some competitive advantage will remain due to being born and developing as male. This is also borne out by the observation that many male-born trans-athletes are rising to the top of female competition. Link HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE.

>Seeing male-trans athletes rising to the top of female sport is inevitable because the difference between winning and losing at elite level is so small. Analysis of the performance differences over the last 3 Olympics confirm exactly how small that difference is. Link HERE. The average difference between winning Gold vs Silver is only 0.8%, for Bronze and no medal is 0.4% and making the final or not is 0.3%.

2744,egadsby,"the phrase is meaningless, like most things westerners have defined, because history is by nature so blatantly obfuscated and censored that there is no ""right"" side of it.  

For example, the ""right side"" of history is when you genocide a literal one third of humanity and nearly all megafauna on earth.  

I hate to use an alt-right term but ""virtue signaling"" really describes it succinctly (and the right does this in spades as well).  Obfuscating and blatantly denying reality in the name of your prejudice, whatever ""virtue"" that may happen to be.  "
2745,,"That is not how this is going to end.

When in the entirety of history have men not only admitted to making a mistake, but made any attempt to correct it? That isn't how men do things. They either double down or cover up and lie lie lie.

"
2746,,"Does the black community see transgender activism as white people shit?

I ask because I've seen the trans community butt heads with the black community before... noticeably, when trans activists were showing up to Black Lives Matter protests and trying to shift the narrative to Black Trans Lives Matter.  I noticed a lot of black activists becoming visibly irritated by the derailing and there were also a lot of black community members who weren't afraid to say it shouldn't be such a huge part of the conversation.

Dangling solidarity and support over people by demanding they toe the line about gender theory stuff seems pretty off."
2747,EquivalentApple,">You do bring a up good point that a major piece needs to be written to CALL OUT the trans community's masculinization of black women in order to support MtF rights to be in women's spaces.

I am glad to see black women outside GC pick up on how fucking racist TRAs are. It makes me so mad when they pull that particular rhetorical move but I‚Äôm not Black and I feel like there‚Äôs nothing much I can say about it other than it sucks and it‚Äôs wrong and they should stop comparing black women to men. I hope someone does write that callout piece. "

2749,randellweems,"This argument is not only racist but flawed. Black woman is such a broad term. Are they speaking about a specific group of darker skinned woman from a country that has a diet which strengths bone density? What what Asian woman? Latina woman? Indian Woman? What is their bone density like? Are white woman‚Äôs bone density reduced because of a low calcium diet in the North America‚Äôs? 

What TiM‚Äôs are really trying to say is black Woman are more masculine and less woman then a white woman. That‚Äôs the crux of this foolish argument. They think that light skin and a porn stars body are the epitome of womanhood and femininity. In their heads they already got the light skin, they just need to construct the prototypically female body to be better then black woman. Fucking shameful.  "
2750,downofthepeach,"This. It‚Äôs completely shameless. 

I don‚Äôt have the knowledge to read and understand the linked study or argue its merits, but from the first paragraphs it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs talking about age-related loss of bone density anyway, not athletic prowess/advantage. But anything goes when defending penis rights. Slight physiological differences between ethic groups is exactly like the huge morphological differences between the sexes. Durr. "

2752,riseupladies,"In Other Discussions, there was a post on one of the trans subs (150+ comments but got deleted) in which the top posts were mainly hand-wringing about how *it's so complex, more research is needed*. Sports and prison are going to be sticking points for preserving female-only space and I think TRAs know this on some level. That thread read like they're in the process of grieving over it, and have moved from denial and anger stage of the five stages of grief and into the bargaining phase - what about post-op? what about the newest crop of males who are being transed before they've had a chance to undergo puberty?

2762,DesdesAK,38. Unfortunately I believe we will have to wait for the trans kids to grow up. All these kids who are given puberty blockers at 10 years old who later realize it‚Äôs not 100% reversible. They can‚Äôt have children. Their growth is stunted. All the girls who realize that actually they‚Äôre gay women and now they have facial hair and an enlarge clitoris that can‚Äôt be reversed totally. When they realize that their dysphoria isn‚Äôt going away and they can‚Äôt blame all the ‚Äúterfs‚Äù for feeling incomplete. All the boys who realize that the gaping hole in their bodies must be ‚ÄúMaintained‚Äù for the rest of their lives or it will close up and get infected. I give it 20 years and there will be so many lawsuits that heads will spin. 
2763,nocommentyet,"It's a little complicated. There are some really vocal supporters of transgender activism who are black, generally they are young black women and black gay men. 

I have always thought this is because in the black community, most of the trans-identified males we're exposed to are people who have been trans since they were teenagers, suffered through prostitution and other indignities, and are usually not very activist at all. They exclusively date men. Most of them are actually gay men and they are our relatives and while the black community has a reputation as being homophobic, when push comes to shove we are far less likely than other groups to exclude our people because they're not straight, like cutting people off or disowning people. So we stay around each other.

The trans activist types posted about here in GenderCritical, well many of them are more like fulltime crossdressers who identify as lesbian so they can get closer to women's spaces. I have never known any black trans male who identified as a lesbian, not saying they don't exist now, but that is well outside the norm for us. I've seen black trans people since I was a kid and never seen a Caitlyn Jenner type either, the kind who don't transition until they're late in age. 

So I bring all that up because I think the young woke black people who support trans activism have our kind of trans people in mind. Outside of them, I think the opinion on this is very strong in skepticism towards trans activism, very strong. "

2765,Mamma_Midnight,"Isn't bone density related to the levels of physical activity people undertake - including intensity, type, duration & frequency of physical activity?  So any comparision of bone density also needs to weight for physical activity.

If they're comparing women in the same country, is it possible that 'black women' are more likely to be manual workers or spend all day on their feet compared to the 'white women'?  When you consider the racial/ethnic stratification found in social classes, & we know class impacts education, which impacts types of employment), we could argue instead that it's being working class that increases bone density & that black women are more likely to be working class."
2766,YoureNotaClownFish,"Just an aside...North America has around the highest calcium consumption anywhere in the world (‚ÄúMilk dos a body good‚Äù and all), but we most likely have such poor bone density due to the amount of animal protein in our diet, which requires our body to pull calcium from our bones to keep our blood alkaline enough.   Compare to places like Japan which has low calcium consumption and high bone density."

If I transitioned but kept lifting, I'd decline in strength and mass, of course. But I'd decline to peak female potential because of just 4 months of training as a man. That peak level conditioning took a female athlete 10 + years of crushing work and probably steroids to achieve. How do you account for that in fairness?

Found that in there.  4 months (so still pretty damn amateur) to match the womens record.  That's it. Its such a joke that anyone thinks including TiM's in womens sports is remotely fair"

I see transmen as being subjected to being kicked out of the women's restroom when they really pass well, just as a few transwomen pass well and are left alone.  

As for  new construction, if all restrooms are going to be gender neutral, women will never have privacy or security again.  I fear that it will be a positive sign for predators to ply their criminal behavior even more toward women and children.

2828,WoahWaitWhatTF,"Not always.  One restroom at one of our sites has the former men's room converted to gender neutral.  And even though that restroom has likely never seen a TIF I heard some men complaining about it.  

Besides ""women are nurterers and want to help TIMs be comfortable and if you don't agree then simply screw what women want"" I could see the average person's logic also being that men might be uncomfortable at open urinals with women walking past.  Also there is probably magnitudes less demands coming from TIFs.

You know, because having a woman with a woman‚Äôs body get aggressive with a woman means the same level of danger as having a man with a man‚Äôs body and strength attack you. Definitely exactly the same.   
Oh but that‚Äôs right, their kind doesn‚Äôt believe that women and men have different bodies. It‚Äôs just politics in all the medical resources where they document that men have on average significantly more muscle and less fat than women.   
I also love when they say that a woman can take a man in a fight if she‚Äôs close to his size or larger. Obviously these people have never seen the real life outcome of that kind of matchup. If he‚Äôs not holding back, the woman could die.   
These people are completely divorced from reality. "
2837,Areliae,"Sorry, I don't normally comment (cause man) but it seems relevant.

The reason this issue exists is that men aren't bothered by it. This isn't due to ""strong men"" or something ridiculous, it's just the resulting comfort of a privileged class. The entire world is our space, so having a separate one really isn't important. They also aren't at risk for assault, don't have periods like women do, and don't really experience sexual harassment (to anywhere near the same degree). If I saw a women in my bathroom I would not be bothered. I'd probably just think ""huh, good for her,"" and go about my business.

And, of course, since this applies to us it must apply to every other human being on the planet /s. Or maybe it's just that it doesn't affect us, so these guys don't care."

None of these men have any right to decide what haircut anyone but themselves is getting. If they don't like what their girlfriend or whoever did with her hair, they should either live with it like the rest of us, or if they *must* and it's okay in the relationship they have, they can point out they liked the one before better or whatever, with no expectation to get a reaction beyond ""okay, but I prefer it like this"". We're not here to be pretty for men."
2933,SxdCloud,"This is so common it hurts. In my country it's just the norm basically, it breaks my heart to listen to grown women talk about how their boyfriend/husband don't allow them (as if they were children) to cut their hair a certain way, dress a certain way and so on. It's infuriating, I always use those moments to let them know they shouldn't allow this behaviour. I have short curly hair and women my age usually tell me about how they wish they could get a similar haircut without annoying their boyfriends and my heart breaks a little bit each time, many relaxed their hair cause their boyfriend/husband don't like curly hair. You're not supposed to comment about any of it cause it's ''between them'' people say."

2941,tervacious,"I had a similar convo with my stylist when I brought up changing my hair radically. She laughed and said, check with your husband first. Mind you this is in a hipstery joint in Wokeville.  I was like har har har and she gently was kind of like, oh I've gotten in trouble with husbands before and went on to recount numerous instances of women coming in and redoing haircolor (always demanding that the women go lighter/stay light, or demanding that the women cover grays) and straightening hair of clients who wanted to go naturally curly but going back to straightening it because their boyfriends/husbands hated it. And men storming in when their wife's haircut was too short and demanding they refund him rather than the woman who paid for the haircut!

She said she had one client whose husband accompanied her on her appointments and told the stylist how to cut this woman's hair, and how blond it should be. I assumed this was some trophy wife situation and she was like um no this woman is in her 60s and her husband wants her to maintain the same color she's had for like 40 years.

You know that whole Keanu girlfriend thing? It's like that. What we do with our hair is so scrutinized, we spend $$$ on it and can't take it lightly because of the reaction we get. It can range from mockery to job loss to violence. Women are drowning in privilege over here."

Not that long hair makes things okay. Then it‚Äôs the wrong color, then it‚Äôs ""why do you have your hair up in a bun"" (in fucking July), then it‚Äôs ""why did you trim your hair so that it‚Äôs only shoulder length"". All said by women."

Thankfully, no one I talked to expected violence, but the fear kept many women from going natural. If you search around the MANY anti-black woman memes online probably half relate to hair. The anti-weave meme is a standard."
2948,Pushy_galore,"I work in domestic violence/woman abuse and I read this a little differently. It seems to me that the stylist may be living with an abuser or her partner/father etc is abusive. It was the whispering that did it for me. A woman who has not experienced abuse and has heard some stories about ridiculous and threatening misogynistic abusers storming into the salons of friends would not necessarily give a toss and call security or cops right away to have him removed.  I am thinking that the stylist herself is living with it or has in the past. If she is, there is 24/7 help to move away from a controlling abuser. 
I have been doing the work for years now and years of hearing stories about these #$&holes has caused me to tell everyone I meet the three golden truths about woman abuse.  A male abuser is ALWAYS misogynistic in his thinking, abuse is ALWAYS deliberate and used to maintain control and abusers will ALWAYS play the victim and try to get his partner to feel complicit in the abuse."
2949,smiolet,"It enrages me, too. 
Domestic abuse is horrifying. I got bangs cut when my spouse couldn't come with me to the hair appointment, and was so angry. Apparently i should have consulted first. But I wanted bangs. This was 4 years ago. I later found out from my hair dresser that my spouse went  to my hair dresser, stormed up to him and told me he could never cut my hair again, along with many profanities. 

It was common for me to be told to put on makeup and do my hair in specific ways before I could leave the house with them, or if we had social plans. Even just going to the gas station I had to look 'hot'. Heavy makeup, straightened hair, and I learned it was best if my clothes were not showing too much skin but if they were tight, always had  to be approved or denied.
It was all about control and appearance. Cutting my hair without permission was treated like a massive betrayal.
But in the same way, when out with my spouses friends, if I was told to kiss Lester or show them a body part of mine, I had to comply. One time we were drinking and my spouse told J to let me touch his dick so I could see how small it was. I thought they were joking, until my spouse starting getting angry that I hadn't come over to them. When I did they whispered that J had no sex for years and it would be really nice of me to touch him, that he had a crush on me, he was depressed and it would make him so happy. My spouse took my hand and I was shaking and stuck it in his pants. I started crying and J was going yes yes thank you thank and my spouse was moving my hand, kept pinching me and saying come on be nice! 
My body was their property to them, but they liked to 'show' me off and to 'show' their friends my body and what it was like being with me.  They felt good when their friends complimented me to my spouse, sexually. after having to touch J's penis I was angry, but when I tried to tell them while we were going to bed they pulled me out of bed by my hair and said I had to listen to them.
We are not together anymore. Not divorced yet, but separated.

He actually told her he would consider breaking up with her if she went shorter than shoulder length.

Since I've been married I've grown it long, dyed it blue, purple, fire engine ref and some more natural colours and even completely shaved my head.

Every time I do something drastic to it, the stylist (I'm cheap so I just go to Super Cuts or whatever) 99% of the time asks me if it's okay with my husband.

I never really thought anything of it (he doesn't care what I do to my hair unless he's the one trying to get it untangled from a zipper without scalping me) until one day I was in the chair having a perm (no, it did not turn out well) and the woman next to me was having high lights.  Her husband came in, I assume to pick her up or something and saw that she was getting highlights done.  He went off on her, called her a whore and threatened to leave her.  She was crying and had the stylist take the tin foil things out and wash it out asap.  When they left (he was still yelling at her) we all looked at each other like ""WTAF just happened?"" and my stylist said to me, ""you know, that's not the first time that's happened here.  Men."" (when she said ""men"" she raised her eyebrow and nodded to me as if the subtext was ""are fucking morons"")

Once, an old man who was getting his hair cut next to me started crying because he saw me getting all my hair cut off. He was gesticulating wildly and saying things like ‚ÄúOh, no why would you ever do a thing like that? What a waste.‚Äù 

No, it‚Äôs not a waste. I‚Äôm donating it. I had no idea who this guy was. Some men feel such creepy ownership over random women‚Äôs hair."

2965,QueenRowana,"We had a couple in my class in highschool. Both of them had really long wavy and thick hair.  We‚Äôre talking waist length both of them! They really bonded over their similar hair. 

The boy looked a bit like he belonged in an 80‚Äôs metal/rockband (this was before manbuns were a thing).  Vagabond style. 
The girl took a lot better care of her hair but it still looked a bit like two huge curtains of thick curly hair hiding her face. 

One day she, spur if the moment, got it cut to a much cuter above the shoulder cut. More than half of her hairlength gone. 
I will admit she was nearly unrecognizable but nothing else changed right? Still a funny cute girl, only difference is he could actually look her in the eye now without the hair curtain. They‚Äôll be fine right?

Wrong. 

BF broke up with her immediately.

I was honestly scared she would hurt me (she was abusive). But for her, she said long hair looks better on both women AND men so idk how rooted in misogyny her long hair obsession was. 

Still, I feel so happy now that I cut my hair! It's liberating and if men don't like it they can fuck off.  It's horrible reading about women who can't cut their hair because of men in their lives...like holy shit, women are not free if they need PERMISSION for a haircut!

 I'm curious to see people's reactions when I go into work tomorrow...I'm sure I'll be told I ""looked better before"" and I can't wait to tell people I don't care lol. Maybe I'll even buzz it off.

2970,EugeniaAlabaster,"I had no idea that this was so common for hairstylists to know about or experience. But why would I continue to even be remotely surprised? 
While I've never felt threatened due to my hair I have had men tell me unprompted what hairstyle they preferred on me even as I'd just returned from a salon visit obviously wearing the style *I preferred.
Having long flowing hair is so sought after that I've been told it can save an otherwise unattractive woman from being totally repulsive."
2971,Meonspeed,"A friend of mine who is a stylist told me that her cosmetology school added a course on domestic violence as a requirement for graduation.They learn the signs that a woman might be unsafe and how to talk to them about it, what steps to take. Sad that it's needed, but glad it's being taught.

I remember when my marriage started getting really abusive my mom paid for me to get my hair done while I was visiting her out of state to lift my spirits. In the hours I spent in the chair I told this young stylist everything- all my secrets, the raw and honest truth about how brutal he had been, things I normally downplayed or hid from my family, friends, even my psychiatrist. I was planning on leaving him and asking the state's attorney to prosecute him for the domestic battery charge he had been arrested for and I just needed to say it out loud, and she just let me spill it all without any shame or judgement. 

I saw her a year later, and told her I was back with him, he had changed, he was wonderful to me again like he was in the beginning blah blah blah. She looked anguished and said ""I can't tell you what to do, but I don't want the next time I do your hair to be for your funeral"" Those words stuck with me, I never forgot them, or the compassion she showed me that day.

I finally left him for good in July. Having a hearing for the plenary order of protection right before Christmas, which I'm confident I'll win, and then I have my appointment with her scheduled for December 28th. I'm really looking forward to updating her on everything."

Anyway, I remember the hair stylist asking me a ton when I was a teenager if I was positive I wanted all my hair chopped off. I kept reassuring her. Of all people, my mom got angry with me. She said I looked like I was a boy and called me ugly and was so enraged,. She didn‚Äôt threaten to kill anyone, but I remember distinctly my excitement of the haircut going from feeing free to getting sick that night/the next day. I literally was throwing up over HAIR. 

I don‚Äôt understand why our hair matters so much to people. I know my mom loves me and probably has no idea how much that hurt (maybe doesn‚Äôt even remember flipping out...she was abused as a kid), but it definitely left a scar on me mentally. It probably played a role in my transition too. Everything I loved being ‚Äúbad‚Äù because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfor girls.‚Äù

2986,,"I was a hairstylist for a decade and I cannot begin the enumerate the times that I would tell a client that a new short haircut would suit their face, be easier to style, would be fun and chic or would be told ""I would love a short haircut but my husband would kill me"". 

This didn't just apply to short hair but also to blonde hair color. I once had a client who had highlights that really didn't suit her and we kept talking about doing something darker that would look healthier and be easier to maintain. We did a pretty light brown that was no where near raven black and her husband called me at the salon to cuss me out and threaten me. He said that I was a ""fucking bitch"" who wanted to make his wife ugly ""because you fucking feminists can't leave it alone.""

I saw women bleaching their already fried ends to smithereens to keep their husbands happy. And then the husband would come in and I would meet him-- I was aghast! These men were always pudgy, dough-y and bald. I hate that women get trapped by the expectations of these men and it is enraging."

2990,TongueVice,"There is a trailer video for a game called Apex Legends on YouTube.

In this trailer video it went over her back store of how she became bald and men in the comments said that now they finally respect the bald Wraith costume and that comment has 5,900 likes. https://youtu.be/yU_eip8IvQU for those curious.

2991,Pikangie,"It's so sad... for such a trivial thing which should be all her own choice, her body.

It reminds me of a video I saw on Facebook, where a woman was stuck with her abusive partner and she had to trick the man to let her (accompanied by him) let her pet go to the vet. There she very stealthily slipped a written note to the desk staff to get help and warn that her partner has a gun, because that was her one and only chance to escape this abusive relationship, due to being kept locked up inside by him any other time. I am glad how the staff there handled it, and he was arrested by police.

But the sad thing is that this seems to be one of the few ways women have been able to find safety from such abuse where they are treated as hostages. It is not unlike the cases of serial killers abducting little girls and the girls' only way to escape would be things like tricking the man into friendship (that I won't be surprised if it involves enduring rape) til she can find opportunity to escape or get help, or distracting the man somehow to give her a chance to escape. The fact that this is as common as it is (and probably more than we hear cause of all the unsolved cases of abductions), while the other way around of boys being violently abducted by female serial killers is pretty much unheard of, it is really scary to be female."

2995,NW_Luna,"Wow, this is interesting. Up till 40 y.o. I'd always had long hair to about between distal scapula and waist. Most of the time would wear it in 1 or two braids, or up sometimes at work. I liked it because it was simple and I didn't have to get it cut or trimmed. Just wash it every so often. No fussing required, so very low maintenance. I recall one man telling me ""don't you find men think your long hair is sexy?"" and I said WTF? Huh? I suppose I was clueless about mainstream culture

Long hair is heavy, though, and mine was thick so especially heavy. I got it cut after 40 to about chin length, because I was tired of having so many HAs from wearing my hair up a lot. My husband was ""whatever you want"" when I told him I was thinking of cutting it, not that I would have paid him much attention about that -- it's MY hair! 

Frankly I find short hair is far more work than long hair. Short hair has to be trimmed/cut frequently, and has to be brushed/styled just so. My hair's thinned with age but still has a lot of (I guess it's called) volume, and looks weird to me. . With my long hair I just braided it back or knotted it up. Maybe trim the ends every six months. It didn't floof out several inches because there was enough weight to hold it down.

So I'm growing my hair longer again. Besides, long hair in a braid is common in many non-first-world cultures regardless of age. It's simple and straightforward."

It kills me because I desperately want to tell them to tell those dudes to worry about their own damn hair and grow theirs long if they like it so much, but they didn't ask me and I don't want to make them uncomfortable and I know not all of them are safe to do so.

3072,hugzboson,Ooh..sounds like you haven‚Äôt listened to Onision‚Äôs video about black hair care tips. My eyes are still in the back of my skull from listening to that PoS.
3073,,Oh yeah. I had locs for about five years. The comments about them were unreal. Just annoying AF.
3074,,Her hair is AMAZING.
3075,randycanyon,"Likewise, and I'm glad you're out. Stay safe!"
3076,TessKaos,"My grandmother thought long hair was childish. She berated all her grown daughters if their hair got longer than their collars. Called it ridiculous for a grown woman to have long hair. Of course she was of the generation that went to the salon for a ""set"" and wore kerchiefs to bed to ptotect the curls."
3077,ForsakenProfession,"But they all had permanents so it could be curly.  Curls, for some reason, were beloved and sought, even if short.  Audrey Hepburn made an impression with her ""pixie"" cut as well. 

I had boys--it was off to the barber for a buzz cut and they loved it, although they started growing long hair when they were teens in the 70s.  I just can't see myself spending hours doing long hair for a couple of  pre-K girls.  They would have had short hair also and taught how to manage it themselves.  I knew women who spent loads of money on hairdressers, but a good cut was all I asked for--and sometimes it was very hard to get."
3078,ForsakenProfession,"Too many girls and women actually think that ""he won't love me"" if I don't do exactly what he says and wants.  It really is pathetic that they are taught that.  It's up to us to spread the word that they should please themselves, not *him* or anyone else but oneself, unless you are doing someone a favor or service.  But just to gain approval from someone who thinks they can control you?  No, because they will never stop increasing what they want, along with  other means of controlling you to get it.

I like doing what I think is good for me and is right for me; I always have.  My biggest mistakes in life were trying to gain approval from some man, even if I thought it would benefit me."
3079,dworkinian,"Yup. Men love using evopsych to rationalize why they like ""fertile"" women aka girls who have no body hair but long hair on their heads. So ridiculous. Men are gross."

3082,elvesdontgrowbeards,"Jesus, that's even worse, the oppression gets a shade of religion too, isn't it? There are many, MANY men like this in Hungary too and we are even more behind in women's rights than the West. But I'd still say that many other men don't give a single f about their girlfriend's/wife's/etc hair. Although my own father would be disgusted probably and he would say that I'm a lesbian(yes, it's a slur here, along with gay/faggot because these are supposed to be ""baaaad"" things), if I'd cut my hair short but I wouldn't care, he doesn't own me(never understood his logic, he has this extreme stance on other topics too). But my BF would be chill with it, we've talked about it. He would be sad for a short while but it would be completely okay.(He's strongly balding and he likes to run his fingers through my hair for some happy feelings :D)"
3083,kitcatkittycat,Agreed!! I will admit that with my ex I preferred his hair longer and made my preference known. I also took his opinion into consideration with my hair and sent him photos when I'd done things. I think in relationships there is a bit of give and take

3086,TechDude30,"You know who else doesn't get to play dumb about being terrible? Literally anybody. Be it guy or girl anyone can be a real piece of work and their gender doesn't have to do jack with how terrible of a person they truly are.

Why how about a story where a mother was told her kid was sick and needed rest but the mother insisted that her son was fine well enough to keep performing in the play only to become unconscious and pass away all because his own mother wouldn't listen.

Or how about another story where both parents a Mom and a Dad treated their own child like property wanting to sell her off as it was her ""given right."" 

So yeah being a terrible person doesn't have to deal with what hangs between the legs but instead with how each given individual acts and treats others. I'll treat everybody the same way they treat me. Be nice to me and I'll do the same in return but treat me like crap and you get the same in kind."

People like this stompede over other people, and create a barrage of destruction in their path. If you're not 100% supporting of your father's demands, you're therefore totally against him, and must be demonized and destroyed.

People like this are nasty, they make up the majority of trans cults. I'm sorry you got one of them as your father, seeing how I've seen how horrible they can be.

No one wants to transition to just be an average woman it‚Äôs always got a huge element of fetish.

3119,Foltbolt,"Thanks for this post. A very interesting read and my heart goes out to you and yours.

Recently, Deirdre McCloskey (a famous TiM economist) wrote a piece published in the Quillette about his experiences after transitioning and one thing that leapt out was how his kids completely disowned him while he claimed he loved them and desperately wanted to be in their lives.

I kept thinking that ""If you had such a loving and healthy relationship with your kids before transition, this would not destroy your relationship with them. What the hell did you do to them that you're not telling us?""

I am glad your mother (as opposed to your father) sought to act in your best interests as she navigated that nightmare shitstorm.  And as opposed to your father, it's you who sees clearly and are the real ally of women."

Absolutely this. When I read any posts in r/inceltears, they read exactly like transcels. They reinforce the delusions with each other and it is a big circle jerk.

I just can‚Äôt wrap my mind around what a clever, well-orchestrated campaign they have created. There has been such a wholesale buy-in with the woke and handmaidens, as well as the straight community. 

The only possible explanation is that everyone knows that they are men, that trancels scream loudly and threaten violence, so, to keep the peace: compliance with their demand ensues.

The fable of the emperor that wore no clothes comes to mind. Everyone knew that he walked around naked but to avoid his wrath (and possibly their heads), everyone agreed that he wore a beautiful and fine set of clothing.

Transcels: naked and soulless."

I don't know what's going on inside his head fully since I only know what u have said but from what she/he's done I would say he/she is just using transitioning as another form of abuse, putting stress on the family. Which is also why real trans women who just wanna is put their life without being stereotyped as a violent abuser get abused so badly, because so many people use being trans as an excuse to hurt their family, sexually harass/assault people and other stuff too.

3187,mountainmammoth25,Jesus what the fuck is it with these narcissistic psychos. All the trans people I know (usually in discord servers where there are more people I like than don't so I tolerate them) are just the weirdest most self serving people I know.
3188,AnyGirlInSydney,I think being pornsick (bingeing on porn) has a lot to do with it. It warps their brain.
3189,nini551,"Hahahaha no. They wouldn't be parading their dicks around the women's locker room if that were the case. And that's just the autogynephiles. I do a co-ed activity that for some reason still unknown to me attracts a ton of HSTS. And they can't shut up about how they think they are superior to actual women, how vaginas are gross, how actual women don't know how to suck dick or do makeup like them, etc.

They have little to no interest in women for any reason, or actually trying to be one. They are focused on men and getting men's attention. The main time I really see them paying attention to any woman is when they are jealous she is getting a lot of male attention.

But autogynephiles especially have zero desire to blend, except for specific cases of individuals who are turned on sexually by blending."
3190,AnyGirlInSydney,"Do you really see the ‚Äúmajority of TW wanting to blend in and pass‚Äù? Or is that just the narrative we get told ad nauseum? Every single TW (without exception) I‚Äôve seen/read/heard has demanded attention, and validation - going from merely dominating the discourse, wanting to be centre of attention, telling women we are wrong through to this sort of destructive, fetishistic, narcissism that tears families apart and causes trans widows to suicide."
3191,StupidHappyPancakes,"It *used* to be that way for many trans people.  People have been able to change their gender for several decades, and there weren't any major issues with those trans people trying to invade single-sex spaces or censor speech to fit their narrative.  They were subject to extensive gatekeeping and were expected to pursue SRS, and WANTED to pursue SRS to alleviate their dysphoria.  

Now most trans people want zero gatekeeping, no SRS, and forcibly infiltrating single-sex spaces and taking opportunities that aren't *meant* for them.  They say they don't even *have* dysphoria, yet they expect the taxpayers to not only cover their plastic surgeries but also their electrolysis, waxing, hair transplants, custom wigs, etc."
3192,TryingforMighty,"I've often said that what really drove me away was my ex's narcissistic entitlement.  In the end I have ended up being glad he was such an unempathetic and demanding person, or I might have talked myself into believing I could live with a person who demanded I remake myself in his image (of woman and much else)."

3205,Nibbana0,"Well normally would agree, but this is being pushed by some very powerful people."
3206,,[removed]
3207,StupidHappyPancakes,"I'm definitely not trying to discount your own experience, of course, but I think that even if *some* trans people were born with that predisposition, the majority of people who are going trans these days *are* making a choice.  

When you think of someone ""choosing"" to be gay, it sounds awfully implausible because there's a lot of discrimination and shame that is still attached to being gay, plus it doesn't seem like someone could *force* themselves to be attracted to the same sex if they actually *weren't*.  

But if you think about a straight man who has a fetish for imagining himself as a woman, then turning trans lets him fulfill his fantasy full time AND with the current social and political climate, he can claim victimhood, oppression points, and maybe even tons of free, taxpayer-funded surgery.  

There is less and less gatekeeping, so such people wouldn't even have to go through the bother of getting extensive therapy first.   They also can gain an almost unlimited narcissistic supply as they take over women's spaces and censor their speech.  

Finally, if the TIM is a straight man, then he *doesn't even have to change his sexual orientation*; he can just call himself a transbian and continue fucking women.  If a man comes out as gay, nobody would fault his wife for wanting a divorce, but if a man comes out as trans, his wife is cajoled or even *bullied* into staying with him

I *do* believe that some trans people have some kind of inborn susceptibility to this, but they seem to be very much in the minority today and are frequently derided as ""truscum"" by their own community.  The majority of TIMs now don't have to bear the financial, social, or romantic costs that the old school transsexuals did, and somehow it's even okay for them to keep their penises and *still* demand to be recognized as women.  Figuratively *and* literally, they don't have any real skin in the game."
3208,4eyedPurplePPLeater,"All I can guess is that the (modern) movement attracts that type... besides old school TIMs, that I could kind of understand due to external & internal homophobia; it seems to be a different story with hetero TIMs, where they're just misogynistic AF at the heart of it all.       

Besides times/ places with extreme homophobia, why else would men decide going ""transition into a woman"" (a very stereotypical one at that)... unless they're being motivated for nefarious reasons...    

Notice they never really want to women -- they just want to pick & choose the parts they see as ""fun""... all the sexual aspects about it scream narcissism too when you think about it -- wanting to possess faux female body parts for themselves as their personal built in sex toys to get off to whenever, is as narcissistic & misogynistic as you can get.         

They don't even stay consistent with APG either, by claiming it doesn't exist one min, then trying to claim that one shit survey says women are APG just like they are! üôÑ"
3209,MusingsOfASoul,I think so. That's the sense I get from watching transyoutube videos or in subrreddits where trans people post about how they are so happy to be able to pass and not cause any commotion. Seeing the lengths they go through for this I suppose is a testimony as well. I think most trans people don't want others to know they are trans.
3210,MusingsOfASoul,"Yeah, I think like many issues and stances in life the truth or ""proper"" approach is somewhere in the middle. Like a pendulum it is probably the responsibility for both sides of debates to push back on each other to find the appropriate point in the middle (i.e. appropriate amount of controls before medical transitioning or other rights is allowed). I just hope both sides can find enough empathy and step in each others' shoes to find this middle ground unfortunately inevitable with any growing population there will always be bad apples. I hope good ones can eventually dominate the narratives, regardless of which side they are on, and open dialogue be preserved no matter your stance."
3211,MamaAintPlayin,He's a massive douche. Agree entirely. The stalking and online abuse from him & his fellow AGP narcissistic fetishists that Alice Dreger describes in Gallileo's Middle Finger is pretty chilling.
3212,TryingforMighty,Google it.  It's easily found and down-loadable.
3213,Spottini,"Exactly. People will always find a way to foist blame on the women who speak out, but this same crap versus children is no match."
3214,thrownawaybytheriver,"I'll do what I can. I've been testing the waters with my friends, and some of them seem receptive. I do think there are more people that reject the trans narrative than it appears just because of how loud TRAs are."
3215,AnyGirlInSydney,Are you asking me to prove something that does not exist? ü§î
3216,finallyaboy,"That's just from my own experience speaking. I don't believe transgenderism is innate, however, that's just speaking how it affected me. Then again, i was labeled ""truscum"" for who i felt, because i believed to be really trans, you need dysphoria.

Speaking from people who expereince real, legitimate gender dysphoria, as i did, it's not a choice. But, AGP transsexuals are making a choice i feel."
3217,AnyGirlInSydney,"It‚Äôs exemplified by the names they choose - Munroe, Charlotte-Rose, Michelle-Lynn, Chloe, Veronica Ivy etc. - it‚Äôs never plain old Lisa, Kim or Susan is it?"
3218,whinecube,"Right now trans widows don't get any sympathy from mainstream culture.  I am not usually a fan when men post here, but I am thrilled that men (sons) are starting to speak out about the damage trans culture is causing.  When men start speaking out, they will be listened to, and maybe we will see a shift."
3219,lavenderamethyst,"Absolutely there are. But no one feels comfortable to be overt about it. That‚Äôs why I advise that the best thing that you can do is ask questions and sew seeds of doubt. Don‚Äôt introduce talking points in their fully matured form. TRAs and liberals/handmaidens etc. have been inoculated against this. There are many ways to bring up a subject without naming the subject, and you‚Äôll find that when you approach it from this angle people easily agree with a central point. If you were to label it, then they‚Äôre able to deactivate thinking because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been trained to do. But nine times out of 10 they agree with you, and enough of those add up and a person starts to feel the dissonance. Just remember that anytime that you feel nervous because you‚Äôre around a bunch of liberals, the fact that you are male Does protect you. Look at all the people being raked over the coals for going against this ideology; they are all women, no men, not really. You can speak out and return to your regularly scheduled programming. If you want men like your dad to stop abusing, this is what you can do to contribute to the larger movement."
3220,AnyGirlInSydney,There has been some rudimentary research done on how people reach ‚Äúpeak trans‚Äù. One was when they encountered a toxic TIM - whether IRL or online (e.g. Jessica Yaniv was a gift for us). I imagine you sharing your story with people in your life could have the same effect.
3221,InsanelySaved1010,Yes. It isn't an unfalsifiable belief and I posted videos that confirm the opposite.
3222,trawid2016,I agree with this. It would be great if more men talked about this.

I still don't understand how this weird fantasy managed to get itself so central to inclusivity that everyone else got pushed out so fast. Or maybe it wasn't fast at all and I just was slow on the uptake.
3227,itsnotaboutewe,I hope the tide is turning now. I also hope that the trans movement hasn't damaged the image of LGB people forever.
3228,Deleteordecay,"Fabulous news.

I don‚Äôt know if anyone else has experienced this but I‚Äôve had people assume that because I‚Äôm speaking out against the trans agenda they assume that I‚Äôm a homophobe because they can‚Äôt distinguish between the movements and see LGBT as one homogeneous mass.

Most other people falling for the fantasy in question are either well meaning and dumb or just too used to letting men do whatever it is they want (and also to promoting self hate among women who feel the need to transition so they can be ""enough"").

Now I'll admit I don't need to understand it, at the end of the day I don't really care what others do with their own body, but now it's getting to a point where NHS are giving teenagers hormone therapy. Kids who aren't old enough to buy energy drinks in Scotland (actual thing look it up) are now being allowed to make a life altering decision that will fuck up their bodies hormone balance. Just imagine the absolute havoc that must wreck on a 16 year olds body. 

Source is I know a 17 year old that has been undergoing hormone therapy for a year.

Respectfully, that's not what happened. The progressive wing has been focused on economic justice, and the neoliberal wing has been pushing identity politics. I often become confused when people attribute the sjw/identity politics phenomenon to progressives, because as someone who was deep into the 2016 election and closely follows politics here, that's not at all reflective of the truth. Maybe the neolibs tried to coopt the word ""progressive""? There was an attempt but I didn't think anyone bought it."
3307,fuckincaillou,"Because it falls back on that old BS of gender roles dictating men must do this and be this way, and women must do that and be that way, with no allowance of any personal choice. It reinforces the notions that dictate things like how women are responsible for men and that men are not responsible for themselves, that men being violent is normal and okay, that it‚Äôs okay for men to be unfairly participating in relationships and kids and domestic duties, any and every sexist norm that has gotten all of us into this hole in the first place‚Äîbecause the trans ideology relies on the existence and perpetuation of those concepts to have any legitimacy.

That would be a big win for anyone who wanted to disrupt USA society. Nobodies focusing on inventing stuff or producing stuff when they're caught up in this nonsense."
3313,,"When Russia first opened up their ""Internet Research Agency"" they had no real objective other than simply to create chaos.  They supported anything that might be divisive or get people angry.   For example, they managed to create a pro-Muslim online group and then scheduled an IRL rally for that group outside a mosque in the United States.  At the same time, they created a separate anti-muslim online group and then scheduled for that group to have an IRL rally outside that same mosque, at the exact same time.  Neither group knew that the other group was going to be there, and neither did the local police, so there was definitely potential for violence.

They also liked to inflame racial tensions.  For example, whenever there is an incident of a white cop shooting an unarmed black person, they'd flood facebook with ads urging black americans to ""rise up against white supremacy"" stuff like that.  Anything to make a bad situation worse.  Then once Donald Trump started making pro-Russian comments, the entire focus of the operation switch from ""create chaos"" to ""get Donald Trump elected as President.""  Of course, those objectives aren't mutually exclusive, so they didn't really drop their first objective so much as continue pursuing it in a different way.

But despite all that, I don't think that Russians have anything to do with the trans movement, or at least, they aren't the driving force behind it.  The trans movement is funded by medical corporations first and foremost."

It also reminds me of something silly like the CIA would be wont to pull (along with bat-bombs, cat-spies, LSD mind-control studies, etc). I'm just not sure what the CIA would gain from such a move, but who knows? What's definitely certain is that mental health is still in its childhood (we're on the fifth decided-by-committee ""bible"" of 'what is a mental illness, exactly?') and often focuses on drugging people with pharmaceuticals with harsh side-affects over the hard work of actual therapy. 

Then there is the medical profession which has never seen a drug it didn't like, focusing on treatment rather than prevention because it's more profitable. The medical profession loves trans nonsense: hormone blockers, hormone replacements, drugs to deal with the terrible affects of the blockers and replacements, mutilative surgeries such as ""top"" surgeries (read: removing a woman's perfectly healthy breasts) and ""bottom"" surgeries that are so laughably bad that even most trans people don't bother with them. The ""state-of-the-art"" female surgery (I had a chance to look at my friend's binders and pamphlets: he's getting his surgery covered by the state, while my husband can't even get a root canal covered) is blending up a woman's uterus and ovaries and vacuuming them out, and creating a ""phallus"" from thigh skin. The ""state-of-the-art"" male surgery is castration and cutting off one's dick, and then stitching the remnants of the scrotum with some thigh skin to create a ""neo-vagina"" which is just a literal gaping wound that has to be ""stretched"" (read: the body desperately wants to heal, to close that gaping hole, but is prevented from doing that) and is a useless ""hole"" as far as any actual penetration is concerned, has barely any feeling, and is extremely prone to infection, and the surgery, is more often than not, ""unsuccessful"". Kids and young adults are being gaslighted with trans ideology, having their bodies mutilated, and closing the door on normal sexual behavior and relationships forever.

3343,goblinf,"what pisses me off about this is before I was 40yo, whilst my life and career was being totally ruined by my ridiculously heavy constant periods, I wasn't allowed to have a hysterectomy until there was no chance of having kids and early menopause has risks. This was a decade ago. The gynae issues pushed my body so far to it's limits I'm now housebound and was bedbound for a few years, I've lost 7 years of my life to this collapse of my body, my friends, my career, my social life, for a while the ability to read on screen, and the ability to walk.  Yeah it's a comorbid condition but I am pretty damn sure if my gynae issues were under control it would never have got this bad.   


When I asked about hormones the male gynae laughed and said we can't control the dosage well enough to make  difference, the human body is to complicated.And yet if I'd been smart enough to say oh I am in the wrong body I want to be a man, it would have just taken a few counselling sessions and boom. I say smart, that's not what I mean, I think the way surgery is so casually provided and hormone treatment is appalling for future health of these individuals.  I honestly don't believe medical science has moved sufficiently fast in 10 years to change what I was told then.

What's my point? If it's dangerous for me as a hetrosexual woman to have a full hysterectomy at 40, then why isn't it dangerous for far younger women to have 'bottom surgery'?  This is so wrong. It is voluntary FGM. I've been failed and THEY are being failed - for different reasons, but effectively the same procedure."

I am also telling you what I read in response to this topic all the time - why can't they just stick to bisexuals, or why won't bis have sex with them. No one here is saying bisexual people are more oppressed than anyone else, or that lesbians don't have it worse. I am saying woman to woman, it isn't cool to say we will fuck them.

To add that women who know they don‚Äôt want kids are frequently denied sterilization procedures. Yet if they wanted to sterilize themselves in the quest to ‚Äúbecome a man‚Äù it would be okay."
3350,weretomato,"The easiest way to describe it would be in two ways. One what do we make of racism when there are POC in power who are just as abusive of other POC as the white people in power? Something is missing from our analysis of systemic racism. Similarly, what do we make of women in power who are just as abusive to other women as men in power? Something is missing from our analysis of systemic sexism.

If we follow the logic, especially of the kinds of feminism and anti-racism favored by liberals or capitalists, then it's perfectly fine to be oppressive if you just have a diverse group of oppressors. What's desired is equal access to the upper class not the destruction of oppressive class systems.

Just take a look at recent history: Obama, a black man, happily bombed brown people to oblivion for big oil, military contractors, and national hegemony. Hilary Clinton, a white woman, was more than happy to help. She was also more than happy to take dirty bank money in the form of ""speaking fees"". 

The critical missing piece in many analyses of systemic oppression is the systemic oppression itself. For example, what exactly is the patriarchy? Why does it exist? How does it exist when there are women in power? How does it exist when women are the majority of the population? Sometimes you'll get ""radical"" (to the root) answers, and other times you may get something like an evolutionary biology or historical answer. That's because there are many ways to look at a problem. 

The ultimate issue, a socialist or communist would say, is that feminism isn't compatible with capitalism because capitalism is a system that favors exploitative hierarchies, of which sex has been one of those hierarchies. If feminists want to destroy the root of sexism they have to destroy class-based oppression, not just for themselves, but for everyone. 

According to a socialist/communist, if you keep capitalism, you keep oppressive hierarchies, and feminism accomplishes nothing except make conditions cushy for the women who happen to be sitting at the top, while the women at the bottom suffer."

3353,goblinf,"it was worse than that. back in the 90s I had private health coverage. but you needed gp to recommend to see a specialist to be covered. My hormones were everywhere, so was the blood, and my gp made me go see a mental health nurse for 6 sessions in return for agreeing to refer me to the private gynaecologist. These days it wouldn't have been allowed.

Said mental health nurse (i'm crap at names but I remember hers) had nothing useful to say, I'd already booked a holiday abroad so couldn't make the last session and I forgot to rearrange it when I got back. Damn woman put on my medical records that I refused to engage and didn't finish the course of treatment and that I put 'very little effort' into it. Thankfully several decades on that's now dropped off my record after one of the many changes of doc when I moved house. But I still am annoyed by it. I don't hold grudges but I have a long memory for that sort of crap.  


And I agree, it's an uneven playing field. In particular with sterilization vs. trans. How is that any different? it's still mental isn't it? wanting to be a man vs. wanting not to have kids. Yeah someone can use the pill rather that sterilisation but a girl can wear a sock in their crotch and invest in some gum arabic and fake hair equally easily. It doesn't make any logical sense that trans is encouraged unless there's money in it somehwere for someone... And it's making money from vulnerable people, and that's against the hippocratic oath."

Sex is not work. 

And why would somebody want to pay another for sex?  I've never understood it.  Okay for $500 you get someone being nice and flirty for 30 minutes which I guess is a major reason men like this - it's more than just sex its the talking, the flirting, the touching - and as soon as their time is up, the act is over, and they don't want to have anything to do with you until you come up with another $500.  I don't see why any dude thinks this is ok.  

I'm sure some dudes confuse it with love and beg prostitutes for marriage and their bubble is burst when they find out none of it is real and the woman is only acting that way because money is involved.

No wonder so many men who are attracted to this have anger issues.  There's no real intimacy or connection yet it seems like there would be.  The only reason the woman is there is for the money.  She would be thrilled if the guy would just hand the money over without her doing a thing.

Can't believe teen magazines have morphed into these billboards for young girls and old men.  That's just gross.  Forget the gorgeous young man instead go for the wrinkled old guy.  No.  I would have never been happy with that."

Of course it's a problem, but that's not what is being discussed right now.  So really MRAs are wasting everyone's time, because instead of taking the time to campaign and advocate for their problems, they distract feminists from addressing their problems as well."

For fucks sake, we have Dan Savage, a gay male, exhorting straight women to have anal sex with men.

The title of the diagram (which as you observe is woefully missing the clit) is ‚Äúanatomy of a non-prostate owner‚Äù. Goes on to make the case that anal penetration is a good way to stimulate the clit.

Men have fewer qualms with buying people for sex than women do. I seriously doubt very many lesbians are into buying women...no more than straight women are into buying men. (Which is why female prostitutes are assumed to be servicing ""Johns""...do we even have a female ""client"" name equivalent?)"
3444,hattiexcvi,"I think you're reading this wrong - at least where I live, rent boy is just a general term for a young male prostitute rather than implying anything about sexuality. OP is just talking about how sex work as work is marketing exclusively to girls, and never boys, and pointing out a blatant double standard. There is nothing about sexuality in that statement and certainly nothing homophobic - you're the one suggesting men having sex with men is demeaning. Also, the vast vast vast majority of people that visit prostitutes are men.  What world are you living in where women visit prostitutes at anything near the rate men do?"

There is no ""custody issues"" that affect men unless you think murdering one child to spite the mother and still even after that getting access to the other children is an issue negatively affecting men, maybe because it makes them all look like absolute psychopaths. If a man asks for custody, he gets it. He can be convicted of any number of crimes against children in general, women in general, his own children, the mother of his children - makes no difference. ""appropriate custody"" is generally little to none (considering how mammalian reproduction works let alone our society), which most men sensibly settle for.

You are really just repeating MRA propaganda, which is patriarchy propaganda."

Female waitresses get their buts slapped and felt up on ALL the time. 

Porn stars experience rape and coercion. There was just a lawsuit against a porn company who was lying to women about what they‚Äôd be doing and what they‚Äôd be paid. And then when they showed up they were forced to perform or figure out how to afford to get home.

3578,RogerStormzy,"Actually I saw a lot of positive comments about it on whatever sub I saw it on a little while ago. People saying they were happy for him.

I mean, it is celebrity culture so they're going to judge her lol. Men are not alone in this. Most people seemed fairly polite wherever I was reading. Most ""rude"" comments were just like ""I can't believe she's only 46."" Which is a reasonable (if not especially sensitive) reaction to have.

I did not, however, notice anybody fuming."

Another norm.

What really gets me is how older men who are wealthy or famous are EXPECTED to have a girlfriend 1/3 his age and is celebrated for it but if and older woman has a much younger boyfriend, she as seen as a ""cougar"" or a whore or someone who is almost basically a pedophile (funny they don't see the irony).

There is also this double standard where if a young women pursues an older man, she is seen as a whore or having daddy issues but if a young man gets with an older woman, he is a hero and she is still called a whore.

And don't even get me started on the whole ""she's past her prime"" nonsense which never applies to men.

It seems in any\every situation, women can't get a break but the penis pass is always granted."

3645,4leafDover,">People lamenting that she looks old for 46 and couldn't possibly be that young can go screw themselves. 

&nbsp;

Severely enforced cultural standards train an otherwise intelligent animal,  humans, to have a lazy eye (brain, actually). People see silver or grey hair and think ""old."" 

&nbsp;

In post-colonial societies with Western-inflicted self-esteem complexes, any woman or man with a light complexion was deemed a great beauty and any dark-skinned person an ugly brute, totally irrespective of facial features. 

&nbsp;

When I moved to the West, I observed how conditioned people, especially males, were to considering as ""conventionally beautiful/handsome"" any blonde-haired person with a slim (female) or tall (male) build, again irrespective of facial features.

&nbsp;

I just watched my grandmother smile and laugh for the first time in a decade, after my 94 year old grandfather **finally** died. They were 22 years apart and we watched her soul die while she played nursemaid to her aging, ailing husband.

It's like caring for a very large, very angry baby who can voice their entitlement and verbally abuse you. They fought *constantly* when she became his nursemaid.

She was a husk, broken, just a tool to tend to his needs. Him dying was finally her freedom. She travels now, has friends, is able to leave the house whenever she wants.

Just a heads up."
3749,throwawayanylogic,"My partner and I have a 10 year age gap (we met when I was 32, he was 42.) Been together for 15 years now, mostly very happily. No kids, both of us childfree, so that was never an issue either. I always was into older men and I know some of it goes back to childhood issues to me, but honestly I just found so many boys and then men so immature for their ages I just never had any interest in most men my age. We run into the occasional generation gap issues but it's pretty minor for us and often just a joke re: what music and tv we grew up on. But I could see it being a bigger issue if there was a bigger gap between us. 

I recognize and we have talked about the fact that I will likely outlive him but I'm ok with that; I spent the bulk of my life being very independent and am already planning on how to continue being so when I am older. Will probably end up living together with a bunch of my women-friends who never married, never had kids and are happy that way."
3750,LandisRiv,"Ugh, that's even worse. How can he think that's okay, especially when he knew her as a child. That's beyond creepy.

3757,fuckincaillou,">their primary source of status is each other

I love how so few words perfectly encapsulates the current male social paradigms on the grand scale. Of course there's few like Keanu who simply don't let it get to them and live their lives and love as they please, but so many other men do all of the shitty things and hurt other people and choose partners (instead of other ""lower status"" partners they may have better compatibility with) *all because they want to impress other men.* Not because they want to be happy, not because they think it's what's best for themselves, it's all just to look good in front of other men whose opinions they take way too seriously.

^(not gonna lie, that seems kinda gay--especially considering these dudes are usually homophobic AF loool)"
3758,zazaleaz,"I found that term years ago and ever since, many things clicked and make a lot more sense to me. You would think that heterosexual men would prioritize heterosexual sex and relationships, but many heterosexual men are primarily homosocial. They are homophobic at the same time, so it creates a very odd dynamic. They can‚Äôt express their feelings toward other men without fearing being seen as ‚Äúgay‚Äù. One of the only ‚Äúnon gay‚Äù ways they have of bonding with other men is through their ‚Äúconquest‚Äù of women. Creates a very weird (and bad) situation for all of us, especially for women who are used by these men as pawns in their dominance game. It really has very little to do with sexual pleasure or connecting with women.

By the way, I think a lot of heterosexual women are primarily homosocial (self included)- we prioritize female-female friendship over heterosexual relationships, even though we are straight. But we don‚Äôt really need that word because this is seen a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for women and it‚Äôs not a problem for women to express our friendship love for other women. Women can prioritize female friends without worrying about losing our social standing among other women."

3792,grass-fed_quinoa,"We don't live that way anymore, though. We don't do a majority of the things we used to because we've evolved as a society. ""It's natural"" or ""cavemen did it"" are not good enough excuses for rampant misogyny and patriarchy. It's possible to bond with other men without hurting and killing women. It's a choice men make to display dominance.

You know what's way more powerful than brute force and murder? Mercy. Forgiveness. Love. The things men despise and shy away from, preferring weak, cowardly violence. It's not a good thing to bond with violence, especially sexual violence. It fucks up everyone involved.

This is a pattern of behavior men are keeping around purposefully because it benefits them materially. They *could* hug it out and say how much they care for each other‚Äîthat's a better way to bond than getting together and gang raping some women in the Tribe. But they choose group rape over hugs. It's a choice.

None of this lizard brain cavemen nonsense excuses or explains men's current behavior. We don't have to hunt and gather, there are no mammoths or sabre tooth tigers attatcking us, *there is no danger to bond over.*

All of the recent wars the US has engaged in have been about money, power, and showing dominance. They're bonding over that‚Äîthe sexual violence and dominance‚Äîand decidedly **not** bonding over being brothers in arms defending the Tribe."
3793,zazaleaz,"Mehhhh I don‚Äôt think it is evolutionary. I think it‚Äôs part of the enforcement of the patriarchal nuclear family. There was once no issue with men loving other men as friends and comrades. But that doesn‚Äôt work for keeping the primacy of the insulated nuclear family under capitalism. People might.. like share resources or something! Capitalism no no.

Homophobia and toxic masculinity aren‚Äôt necessary for evolution, but they are necessary for patriarchy. And anyway, hasn‚Äôt it been questioned recently- the idea that men were the hunters. I‚Äôm pretty sure all hunted together way back when."

She then divorced and married another wealthy guy and had a kid to keep him.

3885,4eyedPurplePPLeater,"That's why south park made sure to make mention of that too (The PC babies are crying because ""Mulan identifies as a man & Disney didn't acknowledge it"".)        

This alone should've been a red flag to their supporters, when they started to trans characters & historical figures, based on clothing. There's countless women that had to dress as men to pursue jobs & relationships they weren't allowed too. To ignore that history is misogynistic AF, sending the message a woman is only a woman if they ""Identify"" with their oppression (basically agreeing with the patriarchy; that women are meant to be a certain way, & if not, they must not be women.)         

Everything out of the trans movement is old news. It's the same thing women have fought against over & over... but this time it's from the inside, with a bunch of men in dresses, hiding in a giant wooden unicorn."
3886,whateverdude3858,"Actually Joan of Arc, Marie Curie, Hatshepsut or Grace Hopper were all trans men. How can you believe in the fairy tale of women being able to do the same things than men? Ridiculous!"
3887,bendercritical,"It's not hard to see why they think Mulan is a TIF, consider every single ""transman"" I've ever associated with genuinely thought that wearing pants instead of skirts is what made her a man. Their obsession with sex stereotypes rivals the level found in crazy religious cults."
3888,femurfatale,What! Mulan has to dress in men's clothes because she won't be taken serious as a woman. Was Arya Stark trans too? Same concept. She wore men's clothes so she would be *mistaken* for a man and less likely to be needlessly assaulted.
3889,rinabean,"Oh no, she was a man. So was Joan of Arc, charged with dressing like a man, but she was a man actually. Hatshepsut whose existence was nearly wiped out after her death because she was a woman, guess what, she was a man too! They're all men. Every girlhood heroine of ours was a man!

I had one just the other day try and tell me you know all those graves and those sexist archaeologists saw swords or whatever and said ""it's a man"" without looking at the skeleton, which are fairly easy to sex if you know what you're looking for, and recently they've found many were women, well actually those were all men too. How weird that true real feminism has found that the sexist men were right and women have always done as they were told. But that's just science!"
3890,,But REAL women are content with their gender roles and stay home in the kitchen. That is what they are telling us with this bullshit.

3892,PoeBoyFromPoeFamily,"Well said. 

&#x200B;

The same thing happened with a character from Assassins Creed. If you're into pirates, you might know of Mary Read. 

&#x200B;

She was dressed as a male because her brother died, and her mother only got support from Mary's grandmother to fund her brother, so Mary was dressed that way until she got older. She went into the navy, blah blah blah. She only ever revealed herself to be female when she got married, her husband died, she went back to male, but then she went into poly with Anne and Thatch, so she didn't feel the need to hide herself anymore.

&#x200B;

A lot of people started claiming she was a ""transgender"" and all the bs, and if you said anything to object it you would be sent hate messages.

But they clearly did no research on her, nor pirates back then, as females would dress as males, and reveal their breasts to show their victims they were killed by a woman. Anne and Mary were known for this."
3893,PollyannaPenny,"This is so fucking gross. Mulan was an inspirational figure to me as a little girl as well. It sucks that modern little girls are being taught that having strength, cutting your hair, and being willing to risk it all for someone you love like Mulan did makes you a ""man on the inside"".

&#x200B;

Also, anyone painting her as trans clearly didn't watch the movie. Mulan never WANTED to join the army or fight in that stupid war. Hell, the movie starts with her willingly putting on her makeup and dress and doing everything she can to impress the matchmaker and find a good husband to honor her family. The ONLY reason she disguises herself as a man and joins the army is because she's terrified of losing her father and would rather risk her own life than let him march off to his death. 

And, when she gets to the army camp, she is so laughably terrible at ""acting like a man"" that she nearly outs herself on multiple occasions and all her fellow soldiers think she's a weirdo. And, in multiple scenes, she complains about how much she HATES living with a bunch of dudes because of how nasty they are. And, after she's outed; she never puts on her male disguise again (even though wearing her female clothes puts her at a disadvantage when she tries to warn people about the Hun attack and no one will listen to her because she's a woman). Literally nothing about her behavior or stated desires in the film indicates that she secretly yearns to be a man.

&#x200B;

But, according to the trans/tumblr cult, Mulan isn't a real woman because a real woman wouldn't have risked her life to save a loved one. A real woman would just put on her nicest dress and cry on the fainting couch while her father was sent to his death."
3894,breadandrosestoo,"*unhinges jaw and lets out angry swarm of bees*  Don't fucking touch my favorite Disney movie!  I loved Mulan because she was tough and wasn't a girly-girl while still being female, and while she went to war for love, it was for love for her PARENTS, not for some paramour!

3912,FTThrowAway123,"WTF. Mulan is a WOMAN who only dressed as a man to serve in the army, to spare her crippled father from serving, and dying, at war.  It's pretty clear that she only wore the disguise for that reason. She doesn't show any interest in women (which is pretty clear during the song 'a girl worth fighting for'), and in fact she seems to develop a romantic attraction to the general guy. When he comes back to her home after the war, she's living as a woman and is clearly interested in him. Just because she doesn't submit to traditional cultural roles that women would DOES NOT MAKE HER TRANS.  

I've heard people claim that the girl in National Velvet was trans too, like no, she cut her hair and dressed as a male after they realized the horse only trusted her and would not obey other (male) jockeys, but the horse racing organization only allowed men to compete as jockeys.  Literally children understand these concepts."
3913,mayoayox,True. I've heard them do it with Joan of Arc too. Strong women dont need to secretly be men to be strong.
3914,Carmypug,"No she was a woman held back by a male dominated society who was forced to dress up like a boy to get ahead.

3915,Nibbana0,"The whole point of the TRA agenda is to disempower actual females. Provide sex, labor and support for males only."
3916,loleelo,"Mulan has always been my favorite Disney story growing up because it was about a girl proving she was just as strong, smart, and capable as any man despite the adversity and sexism she faced. She was stronger and braver than any male she fought with.

Her story had nothing to do with her *wanting* to present as a man, and everything to do with *having* to present herself as a man so that she would be accepted by males (by disguising herself), because as a woman she was not taken seriously. You know, an issue women still face it to this day.

So infuriating."
3917,thekeeper_maeven,"This so much.

But you know who else wasn't trans? Anne Lister. She was a proud butch lesbian! Butches aren't trans and they aren't eggs. They don't need to be divorced from their birth sex, all they need is to be free to be themselves. They don't fit society's narrow expectations of women, but that doesn't make them non-women. 

Fuck your gender roles."
3918,freshfew,"Also, Hua Mulan, who the Disney movie is based on, is likely a legendary figure, not a real person."
3919,whatmynamemeans,"Oh! I have a cool theory about Mulan!

While she was attempting to be in the different stereotypical ""gender boxes"", she failed miserably. She wasn't a good ""girly girl"", but she also sucked as a ""manly man"". She only shone when she embraced the best of both worlds. To me, Mulan is a story about not only female empowerment, but also about the dangers of locking oneself inside only one restrictive box and that gender stereotypes don't benefit anyone."
3920,Nona_Biba,"uh like did they gloss over the part of the movie where the army was going to kill her when they discovered she was a woman? And the only reason shang (that was his name right?)  did not do so was because she had already saved his life, so it was payback?"

3925,Star_Aries,"But the fact is that if we are supposed to believe that woman is a feeling and not a biological fact, Mulan CANNOT be female and do the things she did, because she would be too weak, too sensitive, and too busy cooking and cleaning. 

If we are to believe the trans narrative as fact, we have to accept Mulan as trans, as the alternative is accepting that men and women are capable of wearing the same clothes and doing the same things.

Not accepting Mulan as trans would also force us to accept female oppression as something real, and this conflicts with the female privilege of the trans narrative. 

Mulan, Jeanne D‚ÄôArc and women like them are a threat to the trans narrative, and they have to trans them as they cannot erase them from history.

This is female erasure, and it is not a new thing."

3930,Phamrsolone,"Real question, why do Westerners feel entitled to appropriate a major Chinese legend and historical figure to fit a trans narrative, and then turn around and sling accusations of transphobia when they know little outside of their bubble of Western White Transness?

3938,SupporterIX,"Transgender ideology cannot be supported. I know what I face by saying this, that I am a bigot or that I am equal to a full blown fascist, but this is something that needs to be struggled against because if not then women as a category will disappear. All sorts of human rights abuses could occur as a result. That Mulan is a story of women‚Äôs empowerment is not a matter of opinion, and therefore is not up for debate in my mind. The truth always wins in the end and the distorters are always cast aside in the ever forward march of human development."
3939,Kaynxrhaast,Oh my God. Did I just agree with some PC bullshit? I don't know what side is up anymore
3940,lgballiance,"Mulan is fantastic for criticizing gender roles all around. The intro is a criticism of societies forcing women and girls into demure and sexualized roles, and the song ""I'll make a man out of you"" is about unrealistic standards of masculinity imposed on boys.
The trans movement, on the other hand, is all about forcing oneself into a strict box based on the artificial gender roles one believes one portrays. Mulan's subtext is entirely antithetical to the trans movement."
3941,MistressChara,"Nobody thinks Mulan is trans outside of fevered headcanons. Mulan is a big deal in trans spaces because the struggles she goes through trying to fake being a man in the army/trying her best to learn how to ""be a man"" resonates with a lot of trans people. Plenty of Trans men use the song ""make a man out of you"" as a way to make themselves feel better when dealing with dysphoria or transphobia.   


It's also because there is so little positive representation of trans people in quality media that people latch onto whatever character or show makes them feel validated. Sailor moon for instance is popular among trans women because it allows them to live the childhood they never really got to live in a way.   


The whole point is finding empowerment. Not rewriting Mulan into being trans."

Responding to them imo gives their insane claim legitimacy. 
Also Jeanne d‚ÄôArc DID wear male clothing and that‚Äôs one of the reasons she was convicted of heresy.
I don‚Äôt understand why you are even saying this. She did wear male clothing and once she finally ¬´¬†admitted¬†¬ª her heresy (after being forced to) she was forbidden to wear it ever again. And then she was returned to prison and surprise! could only find male clothing (a trick by the English) and in order to avoid getting raped she was forced to wear it again. Therefore she was considered relaps which means she went back to heresy and the result is automatically death.
Which is what the English wanted all along: to burn her. Not for her to spend her lifetime in prison, which was the original sentence.

Women weren‚Äôt exactly allowed to be warriors at the time: just because a few women did choose that profession (Jeanne des Armoises for instance) doesn‚Äôt mean it was totes cool. It wasn‚Äôt.
Jeanne d‚ÄôArc was an exception and it was stressed that she did it to save the kingdom and because God had chosen her. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be a normal thing for a woman to be in an armour and be around men (especially since she wasn‚Äôt married) but she was a virgin and the situation was desperate.

I doubt she would openly speak about her menstruations to him especially when he called them ""the secret illness of women"". It's even more doubtful after all the inspections she endured. All confirmed she was a virgin with absolutely normal genitalia.

It's even more disrespectful to claim she was secretly a man, since her conviction was about her femininity. She was literally burned at stake for being a woman."
4029,thekeeper_maeven,"Yes, it has. There was a nosedive when it stopped being perceived as a pencil-pushing job and became a more respectable position. As the demand for programming surged, the women were pushed aside for male applicants. plus all the earliest home computers were all marketed to men in pop magazines (along with video games). So we saw these two budding interests become gendered practically overnight. 

I think it's interesting because it provides us insight into how gender imbalance and sexist ideas about capability begin. The older generation that saw this shift and were more aware of early female involvement were less likely to believe in sexist ideas than the younger cohort who simply observed the imbalance and made snap judgments like ""men are better at programming than women"". They observed AND THEN tthey justified their observations."
4030,nikitatx,"It has. I work for a consultancy, which in practice means I work on several projects a year with high profile tech clients. Every single time I go onsite to meet a new client, without fail there are almost exclusively men in engineering. Row after row, floor after floor. The one good thing about an open office is it makes spotting that really easy. 

What‚Äôs sad is that many of these companies participate in ‚Äúdiversity hiring‚Äù, and host events exclusively for women. I think that‚Äôs great, and more women are needed in all departments for these companies, but the majority of attendees are not software engineers. I honestly believe there are not enough female software engineers to begin with that diversity hiring doesn‚Äôt do anything to correct the root of the problem. We need to be teach girls and young women that math and science aren‚Äôt ‚Äúuncool‚Äù, and excelling at those subjects is a good thing. To me, it feels like some sort of unspoken taboo that a girl should not want to grow up to work in a STEM discipline, and _that‚Äôs_ what really needs to change."
4031,exnbthrowaway,Bingo.  They don't want to do any of that pesky work like write their own stuff or create there own spaces.   They love stuff like head canon-fictional or non fictional-where they pretend that other people or other people creations were really transgender.

4034,Thatstealthygal,How is it that there aren't heaps of historical men being redefined as transwomen? I only ever see it as women being redefined as trans men. It's almost as if there is some socio-cultural reason why women have historically presented as male in order to enter certain spheres or be independent. What could it be?
4035,Thatstealthygal,"Yeah. What I find odd is that these are all women being posthumously and ahistorically transed, presumably by transmen. Who are women. So their disdain for being female is SO profound that they happily refigure these amazing non-conformist risk taking women as trans, because they're projecting their own ideas about themselves on to them.  


But then again IS it transmen who are doing it? After all the person who  insists Kurt Cobain was a trans woman (uh, no seriously NO, he might today have decided to be NB at best) is female, no?"
4036,Thatstealthygal,"Of course they're not. But the women being touted as trans men of history are most of our role models.

Once again women are expected to.give up what they have to support other groups while men get a free pass.

Ada Lovelace too!

I remember the debate in the 80's about girls in math and science (predated ""STEM"" as a term), with the influence of that ""Bicameral"" split brain crap still in the air, I heard women=language ability (soft) and men=technical or math ability.  Thing is, the brain is (in certain areas) divided and math and language come from the same side.  Either both are ""male"" or both are ""female""  (or neither). No split. We knew that then."
4047,GoshawkToday,"As someone who wanted to be an engineer and was pushed into arts and literature, I partly agree with you. I've heard people say what you said that girls need to learn that math and science aren't nerdy or uncool, but I'm not sure that is the main problem. 

A big problem I see that is very difficult to correct is informal learning environments, for instance boys who program hang around with other boys who program. By the time you get to a college environment, they have more experience and it can be discouraging. When I was in high school, most of my friends were interested in the arts and literature. We spent our spare time writing and reading poetry, drawing and similar things. By the time I got to college, I had a pretty developed skill set in those areas and a lot of confidence. In many STEM subjects I felt inadequate, not in terms of raw ability but in terms of acquired knowledge.

It was later in life that I went back to school and took some of the math classes I didn't have the time in my schedule to take when I was an undergraduate. When I learned to program it was in a summer session that was directed at career changers and about half the class was women, so the interest is there.

Trying to do things to counter act those informal learning environments could be helpful. It may not be a coincidence that the percentage of women in CS started declining shortly after the introduction of the desktop personal computer.

Of course, a lot of my experience is decades old and since I never had children I haven't kept up on what young people do. My step daughter is studying engineering, but I've never talked to her about how she decided that. I know my husband encouraged her interest in that a lot. 

I'd be very curious to interview college age women who did well on the math section of the college entrance exam but did not go into a stem field and find out why not. It's possible we could get answers we don't even anticipate.

I have some other thoughts on that subject, but I don't want to bore you."

4052,nikitatx,"I absolutely agree that informal learning environments discourage female participation from a young age, and in my personal experience that doesn‚Äôt change as one gets older. I think this is another puzzle piece that explains why more women don‚Äôt choose to work in STEM. 

Another piece is that once women do start in these fields, the environments in which we work are overly competitive and aggressive. I think about that quite a bit. I‚Äôm established in my career and refuse be forced out, but I also can really empathize with the women who choose to leave the industry. It‚Äôs not the outright harassment that wears me down as much as the constant and overwhelming soft sexism. 

I made the choice awhile back that I will no longer work for an organization run by a man. I know this position comes from a place of privilege though, and women with less established careers most likely can not afford to make the same decision as it severely restricts one‚Äôs employment opportunities.

4089,Illustriousworry,I first saw the Incels video and actually thought it was pretty good; and then I liked his other videos but got creeped out at how overly sexual they were.   The last straw was when I saw the video about TERFS and him saying he would rather be ornamental then useful.

4095,,Ironically it wasn't Contra that tipped me off in the first place but it's kinda what cemented it. For some stupid reason Contra is viewed as an authority. Ask basically anything about trans people and gender and you'll be directed to Contra. Really gotta question why no one wants to just coherently explain their ideas instead of directing you to a low-substance video that has about 50 layers of humor and costume tacked on it. It's the same thing that sent me away from religion. Why explain your beliefs when you could just quote the bible?

Then along came one friend who questioned all of it for me. He asked me not to get pissed-off, but to just listen (*Devil's advocate, ready?*): *how can a physically intact man claim to be a woman, let alone a lesbian?*  
I immediately got defensive and he dropped it. But the cracks had formed. I eventually peaked and ended up here!"

4099,antigender111,"I hope one day to write a post on GC that makes Nick Parrot cry.

One of the (many) things that really pisses me off about Nick William Parrot is that an actual woman, even with the porn attire and drag makeup, would NEVER, EVER, get a sliver of the attention he does for his quarter assed ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù channel. 

If she were to dress the way Nick Parrot dresses she wouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously for a half a second. If she were to make the childish emotionally based ‚Äúpoints‚Äù that he makes in the vast majority of his videos she would be chewed to pieces by the Internet, not praised as a messiah.

Nick Parrot is not a particularly smart man. He was born into a wealthy family, he had an education that allowed him to posture and pretend he‚Äôs intelligent, but Nick doesn‚Äôt have any actual ideas of his own. 

He may be an empty husk of a man, but he is smart enough to understand, deep down, how much of a fraud he is. 

That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs still so unhappy even with all the attention and praise he receives. That‚Äôs why going on r/gendercritical ‚Äúmakes him cry‚Äù. It‚Äôs not because some women use the t slur and talk about his huge man hands (which by the way are huge indeed Nick you don‚Äôt pass), it‚Äôs because the women on here see straight through him. 

That‚Äôs what kills him, it is the refusal to submit to his fantasy that he is a Natalie Portmanesque waif of a genius, and not an aging, porn addicted, botched, talentless, mediocre man who tried to turn into his sex fantasy but wont be able to keep up the facade much longer :)"
4100,Baredmysole,"> Hey Nick*

4109,downofthepeach,"I used to follow him in the heyday of the YouTube atheist community when he had a few thousand subscribers. I remember the porn livestreams, his naive sexism, his pretentious aloofness, and that footage of him at an atheist meet-up where he got ridiculously drunk and had to be babysat by his friends, one of whom I think was his girlfriend for a while (a much more popular video maker at the time). He seemed socially awkward and a little bit sad. He disappeared, as did most of the rest of that community. 

When he came back as Contra, he made a couple of interesting videos and I wasn‚Äôt at all surprised that he was still a vainglorious aesthete but at least a little more sophisticated than before. Now the cultured pretty boy has truly come into his own. He‚Äôs the perfect face for the trans movement - he‚Äôs shallow, cynical, superficially charming and clever enough to fool stupid people into thinking he‚Äôs a genius. Thanks to the generosity of his followers, he can finally afford to be the libertine he aspired to be when he was twenty. But he‚Äôs still a sad, now rapidly ageing, nerd who has peaked in popularity. I don‚Äôt think his story will end well. I don‚Äôt wish ill on him, but he‚Äôs a woman-hating prick so I don‚Äôt wish him good, either. I think self-destruction is part of his ultimate goal, and will be curated beautifully, I‚Äôm sure."

But now it seems that every video lately involves more navel-gazing and obsession with very narrow issues. The last four videos are all mostly related to trans content and the particular issues with which Contra is struggling in the moment. Before, Contra talked about racism, fascism, cultural appropriation, toxic masculinity, things which impact people on a much larger scale. And now it's just stuff like ... plastic surgery? Pronouns? And angry feminists who hate trans people? And the conclusions are so wrong, or based on such incorrect assumptions, that it then makes me question the content of every other video which I previously liked."

Contrapoints‚Äô video on Gender Critical was really bad and neglected to address the issues that made me GC; like cotton ceiling rhetoric, trans women in women‚Äôs sports, and trans bullying of women who have the audacity to refer to their own reproductive anatomy  ( the bullying of women who wear pussy hats to the women‚Äôs march is what peaked me)

As a side note Contra acted out a TERF character in the GC video who was like a Wiccan earth goddess rad fem and I honestly started liking and identifying more with the parody character than Contra ."

That's why I'm disappointed. What happened to steelmanning? Jordan Peterson, incels, the alt-right, even the fucking golden one got a fairer shake than transmeds and and rad fems in your most recent videos. 

One specific example: In Transtrenders, Tiffany Tumbles says that she's trans because she has a gender dysphoria dx. The counter (contra?) argument? Gender dysphoria wasn't recognized until 2013! Ha! Except, (1) that's not how medical diagnoses work and even if it was, (2) gender dysphoria was just called gender identity disorder before then. That's just one of many. Are arguments that shitty supposed to actually convince anyone? I thought you were better than that. The quality and strength of your arguments has dropped. You're just preaching to the choir at this point.

He's great at being manipulative and cherry-picking, then molding his videos into true devices of witty persuasion for the intellectually weak. 

The #1 thing that indicates he's still a man is the fact that he's able to take what we say here and use it against us, with zero emotional connection to what we feel.

* ""I'm not an anti-feminist, that's offensive. I'm just gender-affirming/""gender-euphoric"", even though gender is literally what male supremacists put in place to force women to look and behave differently from men.

The idea that women need their own spaces/orgs is 50 or 100+ years old depending on how you want to count, before ""trans"" was a sparkle in someone's underwear. It's like saying Stoicism is a reaction to Nihilism.

""TERF"" is much more akin to ""queer"", in that some people are offended by it because it's a vehicle for hate and violence, some people adopt the phrase as a form of resistance. To really believe the acronym describes a political group, you'd have to believe that feminists organize to ""exclude"" trans people specifically, which is clearly false. Feminists get together to exclude men, of which TIMs are a subset. This shows that ""TERF"" is a word authored from the TIM perspective, not the female. It literally centers men and erased women outside of their relationship with men. Hence: www.terfisaslur.com

4358,,"i feel like this is really easy to say when you live in a country where you can just ‚Äúidentify‚Äù out of womanhood. in most countries outside of the west, women are women because they have vaginas and can potentially produce life. women are oppressed because they have vaginas and wombs, because they menstruate, because they can have miscarriages, because they can abort fetuses, because they are physically smaller and thus more fragile. its these physical qualities that make them oppressed. these are qualities that no one chooses. its not just ‚Äúnot male,‚Äù and in fact, thats a very typically sexist view. the whole male is the default and female is just an afterthought (that kind of thinking comes from the patriarch‚Äôs manual: the bible, eve being a simple extension of adam‚Äîthe default human). 

you are a male. maybe you recognize that, but youre drawn to femininity. nothing wrong w liking feminine things at all. but youre literally mansplaining To Me, someone who was Born a Woman, what it means to be a woman. its not a special little feeling. its not about wanting to twirl in a dress. its not about opting out of maleness just because the expectations of manhood are too much, as if womanhood is Life on ‚Äúeasy mode‚Äù (which is what a lot of you seem to think).

im going to assume youre relatively young. truly, deeply examine what this path really means to you. oftentimes people transition to escape from mental illness. nick is a perfect example of that. i have anxiety disorders too. i am gender noncomforming too. but i respect that my body is my body is my body. gender isnt real. sex is something i didnt choose. the only real difference between male and female is biological; beyond that, anyone can be as masculine or feminine as they want.

just stop calling yourselves female and stop coming into lesbian and female only spaces and demanding equal treatment. female only spaces and lesbians exist to get away from penises. bodies are real. gender isnt. so plain, simple, and logical."

Iran as a society is homophobic as fuck, rather have a trans ""fake"" daughter than a gay son cuz a man is not a real man if he's being penetrated. It is not progressive, super sexist and should not be a standard of trans positive measure, it's fucked up."
4366,dulead,"I mean in regards to the whole male being default, I meant it as a bad thing. simone de beauvoir said that women are defined by their relation to men. Women are called the imperfect men and even Aristotle said some high key sexiest shit about women, which one can possit this line of patriarchal thinking is just deeply rooted in western thought. I hope one day we don't identify women by their biological abilities or organs because that would women who had their uterus removed for medical reseaons wouldn't be considered a women and that's messed up. 
I've never met a trans girl who has ever said that being a girl is life on easy mode, I've seen a lot of male cringelords who say that though and I'm more a pants/tight person I got scars on my legs I wanna hide. 
I did't think I was explaining anything in a condescending manner, you asked me what I thought it meant to be female and I answered with what I think it is. Sorry if to came off that way. simone de beauvoir said that a woman is able to make chooses like men and elevate oneself into a world of freedom where they won't be defined by their relation to men. 
I can't speak for other places but I'm fortunate to be here even more so after what my family went through and what I did when I was younger to be where I am but I did years of therapy and lots of deep soul searching. It was either this or suicide and I'm happy with this, I'm happy with who I am now. It wasn't a funny little feeling it was lain, lots and lots of pain because yeah gender isn't so logical"

Then I decided to google what exactly Simone de Beauvoir said about choices and I find the exact paragraph from wikipedia you just paraphrased, including the mention to Aristotle lol anyway, here it goes the gist of my comment.

You talk about choices, women not shaving their legs or deciding not to wear ""feminine"" clothes, and I can't believe you dont realize how much of that is a superficial and privileged view. I don't fucking care about having support about not shaving, I care about being able to wear clothes that won't land me a heatstroke and not being leered at or even harrassed, I care about not being asked I have children in my job interviews, I care about women not being able to have a goddamn abortion in my fucking third world country without risking jail time or dying in one of those clandestine clinics, I care about not being afraid of going out after dark because the most that can happen to me isn't simply having my phone and wallet robbed, I care about not having to think I can't be sitting in an aisle seat when I take the bus because some dude may want to rub on me, I care about not having to deal with dudes that can't understand I just want to play a game without being hit on or hearing my place is in the kitchen after being repeatedly turned down, I care about my fucking president saying that he had a daughter after a bunch of sons because he had a moment of weakness, I care about not having to constantly have my earphones on when I'm out so dudes will leave me the fuck alone. I could keep going, but I want to be clear I don't fucking care about shaving."
4372,,"i dont have the energy to reply to most of what you said but i will say this: i am sick and tired of trans rights activists using women who no longer hace uteruses to say ‚Äúwell she doesnt have a uterus so she‚Äôs not a woman either.‚Äù 

what an awful, ignorant and disgusting counterpoint.

a woman who has to undergo a hysterectomy and lose her uterus is still 100% a woman, because that surgical experience and its aftermath is 100% tied to her womanhood. my aunt had a hysterectomy last week after suffering for decades with endometriosis. she was never able to have children and everytime she got her period‚Äîwhich TiMs also claim to have just cuz HRT gives them cramps lol; that, or they fetishize it‚Äîshe would experience excruciating pain and an extremely heavy blood flow, so debilitating she couldnt leave her home. do you know how many women suffer from endometriosis? 1 in 10. they might be infertile. they might have to have their uterus or ovaries removed, but they are still women, because those are real women‚Äôs issues. they are not menstruators or uterus-havers‚Äîthey are WOMEN. 

i know TiMs don‚Äôt see older women as real women but those are women too. my mother in law had to get a mastectomy after breast cancer diagnosis. my mom is going through menopause right now, which comes w horrifying symptoms. they are still women. those are women‚Äôs issues. you would not understand."

4376,pixiebiz,"TERF was coined by libfem/funfem TigTog, a male kowtowing blogger, specifically as a slur against radical feminists.  Its original use was as a way to pigeonhole and demonize women who prioritized female liberation and the fight against male supremacy and refused to get on our knees for males and chanting the holy catachisms ""Transwomen are Women"" and ""Feminism is for Everybody"".  It was then popularized by such internet Trans Luminaries as Char the Butcher (an actual self professed Nazi, also originator of ""Die Cis Scum""), Gender Bitch (Infamous for blogging about torturing a black radfem with acid, among MANY other women hating fantasies), Jos Triutt (who took over as editor of feministing and immediately began to purge women who stuck up for the rights of actual female humans), and of course the lovely Julia Serano who thinks that reproductive sovereignty focused feminism is transphobic because he feels it is ""alienating"" to him as an ""infertile woman"".  So no it was not coined by radical feminists, TERF has always been a term used against us by misogynists who hate the fact that there are women who are willing to name the problem of male violence and refuse to shut up about it.

Something men will never understand. No man in history has *ever* feared being forcibly impregnated, specifically because they're males, and males don't get pregnant.

Of course this danger isn't *what makes a female a female*, but it's a fact that the reason it's a danger is **explicitly because she's female**.

4440,goblinf,"Ben isn't a biological man. Ben is a biological woman/female. Who chooses to live out the social construct/ fantasy that they are a man in their lives. And expects the world (including all women who are ok living in the bodies they were born in and who buy Always sanitary towels) to conform to that social construct/fantasy without any regard for that other majority of people who don't have the mental illness/fetish preference that imposes solely their will on everyone else.  
If I met Ben and they told me they were called Ben and to use he/him if I wouldn't mind because it made them feel more comfortable. Then i would do so, because that makes Ben more comfortable living their own life, with which I'm absolutely fine doing. But in doing so I would merely be being polite and valuing Ben as a human being with their own ideas and way of living. I wouldn't actually believe that Ben was a biological male, just that they wanted to be referred to in a very narrow stereotypical social construct that they perceive to be male.

So if sex is male/female and gender can be anything you choose, Ben has the biological sex of a female (the two options being male and female) and the idea of gender of (the closest they can get to an approximation of) male.  


I feel concern and sympathy and empathy for Ben because they are unhappy in the fundamental physical reality of their existence, and choose to relieve that by constructing a different reality for themselves. However, when their new construct comes up against actual reality - like having periods (though I understand for trans men (TIF) the hormones they take stops periods pretty quickly), or such as the 50% of the global population realising that Ben is living a fallacy and has been enabled to impose that fallacy on everyone else with periods - then their ideology and insistence that their ideology takes precedence becomes a talking point.  


To discuss such issues is NOT transphobic. To disagree with Ben's point of view about the symbol for women being appropriate on packaging for a product exclusively designed for biological females is NOT transphobic. 

On the contrary, the phobia appears to be about biological females having the right to speak about their own experiences and feelings. 

I support the transcommunity being a part of the world, noone should live in fear or be disadvantaged, but at the same time, the giving of rights to a minority ought to be adding to the world, not supplanting or restricting a different section of the world.

People are entitled to their own opinions but NOT their own facts. So the person who told you it was transphobic nonsense, that is an opinion. They hold their opinion. They are entitled to hold it. Just as I am entitled to hold my opinion. What they are NOT entitled to do is to seek to stop people with different opinions from exploring the issues just because they are uncomfortable with scrutiny."

Like women are supposed to be their ""sisters,"" so the fact that we're not advocating for their ""rights"" (AKA our own erasure) is somehow worse than men actually killing them?

But I will say, when you see this issue raised in online fora, TRAs have a vastly different reaction to women than they do to men who are critical. Men are ignored, even understood. Women are shrieked at and threatened. I've tried to wrap my head around this, to understand why, and they only thing I can think of is the old stereotype of men being reasonable and ""just speaking their minds,"" while women are hysterical. In this instance, that is especially cruel, because these things don't affect men. Just women. How dare we get emotional about it, right?"

4485,goblinf,"They have stated their opinion.   
You are not required to agree with it. Nor are you required to believe what they believe.  
If you posted it on your wall, it is your right to do so. Personally I continue to share such things on my wall, I've had similar responses. My reaction was to insist that any discussion is (a) polite and (b) everyone understands that they are entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts.  


So in this instance, Ben has periods. Only biological females can have periods. Ergo, Ben is a biological female. That's factual, logical, scientific, empirical cold hard facts.  


Ben retains the sex of biological female AT THE SAME TIME as choosing to live their life as the 'social construct' they perceive as male. The key here is THEIR PERCEPTION. This perception of Ben's that Ben is male, is intangible, it can't be seen, without hormones or surgery, it doesn't show in their face, body, voice or mannerisms, because they are an adult human female and biology determines that skeleton, fat distribution, muscle mass, and pitch of voice is all in a range that humans have for millenia been able to recognise as biologically female.

This is why misgendering happens, because the biological reality that third party strangers hear or see gives signals of biologial femaleness, they cannot see intangibles, only visual and auditory cues. Only the intangible idea that Ben is male tells us that he is male. Which is why you end up with people choosing male sounding names and specifying pronouns as male, because it signals Ben's perception of themselves.

However, unless you live in a country where misgendering is a crime in and of itself, rather than say intentionally to cause distress (harassment), the average stranger has no idea of what Ben's perception of themselves is. What's more, a gender critical feminist would argue that Ben's perception of themselves should not require external validation from total strangers.  


You are a total stranger to Ben. You are not required to validate their perception. You are not required to invalidate your OWN perception on your OWN wall just to torture logic to fit an ideology that you do not hold yourself.  


If for example I said I was a Christian and believed in God. And you said you weren't and didn't.   
How would you expect me to respond?   
To call you a heretic (best equivalent of transphobe I can come up with)? to claim that you have insulted me and my feelings by not believing what I believe?  That you aren't allowed to say to me that God doesn't exist and you don't believe in him?   
Of course not. And yet by telling you taht you have misgendered Ben, that is exactly what this person is doing - telling you that your world view and your beliefs are of no consequence in comparison to those of a total stranger.  


Frankly, if this person is an actual friend, in real life, I'd be re-evaluating what my ideas of friendship are. To me a friend is someone who seeks to be kind and uplifting of their friends, to understand that everyone has different beliefs and viewpoints, and that it is important to acknowledge reality and facts and what is reasonable to expect, as well as to hold each other to account when we are in error. Me, I'd be asking if that friend fulfilled my criteria or not. I'd also be challenging them on any errors of logic I'd perceived and having a discussion (politely) about the issues involved.  


But it's your wall. You do what you want to do. You are an adult. You get to choose."
4486,HumorlessShrew,"The usage of she/her and he/him has historically been and, for most of the English-speaking world, continues to be sex-associated. Not gender. 

When someone insists that it is gender-based, they mean one of two things. Gender as in cultural norms of masculinity and femininity that vary with time and place. Or gender as in a feeling which has no consistent, definable qualities. With regards to the first, we do not call butch women by male pronouns, nor feminine men by female pronouns ‚Äî no matter how masculine or feminine they may be. I know several butch women who are routinely mistaken for men upon first glance, then people stammer and correct themselves upon actually looking at them. Because they've accurately identified the sex of the woman in front of them and thus correct their mistaken understanding. Gendering people based upon cultural norms of masculinity and femininity quickly falls apart, and most people don't bother. 

Which brings us to gender as an unobservable feeling with no consistent definition. An ""essence"" of affinity toward certain words is about what it comes down to. A preference. And from there we are meant to conclude that this feeling, this affinity is important enough to override pronouns being sex-based; important enough that sex-based pronouns be abandoned altogether, because affinity for how one is addressed matters more than sex. I would argue that it does not.

Sometimes people try to argue that because we must rely on visual and auditory clues to make our informed guess of one's sex, we *must* be relying on cultural norms of masculinity and femininity. As if we are not a sexually dimorphic species which relies on accurately sexing other members of our species for purposes of reproduction. Their assertion is that we, with our incredible brain, cannot do something that other sexually-reproducing species do every day, upon sight. Their assertion is further that because there are sometimes mistakes, even as rare as they are, the whole categorization is suspect and we must instead rely only on the word of each individual person. Nevermind that mistaking someone's innate gender feelings is *never* seen as cause to discard that system as flawed.

Edit: pronouns -> she/her and he/him"
4487,languidswan,"What doesn't help is that liberal feminists do not actually believe gender roles are malleable or even bad, even if they'll pay lip service to the idea as long as it's conveniently disconnected in context from the trans thing. To liberal feminists, to stop the oppression of women means to begin appreciating the feminine social box the same as the male one.

Liberal feminists genuinely feel that it's femininity that's oppressed, not femaleness, and even when  it comes to issues of pregnancy and menstruation and abortion, they manage to spin it into a statistical coincidence since most ""pregnant people"" are also feminine and that's why they're not taken seriously. They fail to grasp the material connection between human reproduction and oppression, and instead think women are oppressed because they're inherently more soft-spoken or more sensitive or some such tosh."
4488,HumorlessShrew,"It is not for lack of understanding, at least not for those who have involved themselves in these matters for very long. These things have been explain ad nauseam."

Same goes for the whole ""reducing women to their genitals"" argument. THEY are the ones reducing US to ""uterus-bearers"" or ""bleeders,"" but somehow us wanting to acknowledge that menstruation is a female thing is de-humanizing.

Look where we are today. 

Women's Liberation?"
4495,MercilessWaffle,"I feel the same. I don't hate trans people, and I know a lot of people with legitimate gender dysphoria that are just as sick and tired of this crap as we are.

The thing is, your biological sex can't be changed. That's just a fact. You can change your hormones and get surgery to physically appear like the opposite sex, but you can't ever 100% be the opposite sex. I can understand why that might be hard for people with gender dysphoria to hear, but as the saying goes ""facts don't care about your feelings"".

It may only be a symbol, yeah, but it does feel like a subtle way of saying ""your existence is not inclusive"". No one should feel like they have to be excluded in order to include everyone else, that just defeats the purpose of ""inclusivity"", but no one who speaks about ""inclusiveness"" really even seems to care about actual inclusiivity anyway, it seems to be more of a power tactic.

I think the issue with a lot of this trans and woke stuff in general nowadays is that we're expected to coddle other people. We're expected to tell everyone they're ""valid"" and nod and agree with everything they do and say, and never criticising them no matter what they do. It's honestly kind of depressing, especially since so many of these people seem to rely their entire self worth and self esteem on other people as a result, instead of having their own self worth and integrity like self confident people should."
4496,catipillar,"No one wants to make Trans men's life harder, so to answer your question ""what do we do?"" We treat them with kindness and respect. I've never met a trans man or woman and in the event that I did I would treat them with just as much affability and consideration as I afford everyone else. 

If the female symbol is on a product I use and a trans man has decided that this makes life harder, then that is the trans man's problem and I wish the trans man luck In sorting it out."
4497,HumorlessShrew,">but in your soul you‚Äôre a man and you want to live accordingly

I really think that sentence needs to unpacked and examined a little bit. A man is an adult male of our species. So the assertion is that, in the soul of an adult female, they are *really* the sex whose normal development includes the small, motile gamete? That doesn't make much sense. How does distress over sex characteristics differ from the myriad other distresses, sometimes extremely severe, that center on various other body characteristics? Does an anorexic have the ""soul"" of an undernourished person? Does someone suffering body integrity disorder have the ""soul"" of an amputee? Are we suggesting and accepting that body characteristics have non-corporeal realities?

What does to ""live as a man"" mean? Does it mean liking certain things, doing certain activities? That is the sort of restrictive sex roles feminists have been fighting against forever. Or does it just mean being *perceived* as a man? And why would that be? Is it that men get more respect? That they are less under threat of sexual violence? That they are not subject to systemic sexism? Is it simply an attempt to not be treated as women are treated in our society? And if it's not that, then what could it possibly be?

As far as I can tell, you can only arrive at such an insistence by believing rigid, damaging ideals about what a woman can be, or by trying to escape the rigid, damaging ideals society imposes on women. What else is there?"

4808,GenderMuffin,"> I don't see why people who deny sex as a material reality can't say the same.

Because different biology between the sexes necessitates different treatment to begin with, and also reinforces a power gap between them. With some very marginal exceptions, this is simply not true of ""races"", which are artificial constructs. For example, higher rates of sickle cell anemia in black people vs higher rates of cancer in people who live in certain areas because they were historically black and thus used as a dumping ground for carcinogens. In the case of disparities like sickle cell, there's not really a need to address it in a racialized way apart from making sure that there's racial justice in healthcare access and population-porportionate spending on research; in the case of the latter, it's racially linked because of racism, but not biology. Sex is vastly, vastly different in that sense. Maleness and femaleness are genuine material realities that persist completely outside of any human systems of oppression based upon them, and are inherent and permanent features of our biology.

I'm not sure whether this is your actual stance or you're just playing devil's advocate, but either way, it's based on a false equivalence."

But white peoples are more at risk of skin cancer and more susceptible to malaria so it evens out. 

Now imagine a world without sexism. No other changes, just no sexism or misogyny. Are females still at a disadvantage? We‚Äôre still smaller, on average, and weaker. We still get pregnant and bear children with all those inherent risks and responsibilities. We still menstruate with all that entails. We still have boobs that get in the way.

Back to your question, if you deny the premise, how can you accurately address the oppression when the cause will be attributed to something else?

A racist oppressor who claims he doesn't believe in race will rationalize his racist action of being rude to the sole table of Asians in his restaurant because he notices ""they were noisier than others"" even if untrue/selective observation. The Asians at that table, who don't believe in race, will attribute it to being noisy despite only 2 peoplel, even if the next tables were noisier and that they seem to be ""noisy"" in a lot of restaurants in this specific ""we're totes not xenophobic!!"" town. Status quo will never address racism.  

Debatable materiality of race aside, let's go with one that we agree is real, like sex, but disbelieved-- gravity. Can someone who disbelieves in gravity expect to survive a leap from a cliff? Will his life be oppressed (paraplegic), yes, but he'll attribute it to not flapping his arms fast enough. Or medical facts-- a pregnant woman who doesn't believe alcohol affects the fetus and guzzles down 4 liters of vodka a day will have a baby with FAS with brain damage-- she'll attribute it to that one time she fell off her couch and bumped her belly... then proceeds to have two more children with FAS.

4851,ohthegametes,"I agree with you there. This is why it *does* track, for me: gender is to sex as race is to physical variations such as skin colour. 

A clunky attempt at expansion follows:

People from different regions on the planet look different, that's a material reality. Race is a social construct used to control and subordinate people with certain features (ie dark skin) to benefit others with certain features (ie white skin). Racism is the practice of this. Human physical variation exists: race isn't real but racism is.

People are either male or female and those two have certain reproductive capabilities, that's a material reality. Gender roles are a social construct used to control and subordinate people with certain  reproductive capabilities (females, the people who can gestate and birth young) to benefit others with certain biology (males, people who can only impregnate). Sexism is the practice of this. Biological sex exists:  gender isn't real but sexism is.

Unlike sexism which is restricted to a hierarchy of two, racism has loads of hierarchies because people have loads of variations. So racism can be much more complex."

4853,adiostoreadoormat,"I don‚Äôt think race exists technically. It‚Äôs really just a bastardization of ethnicity that was warped into a concept in order to justify slavery. ‚ÄúThe black race‚Äù was created by early doctors who thought black people were more suited to be chattel because their ‚Äúskulls were smaller‚Äù and ‚Äúlungs were weaker.‚Äù It was created to justify segregation. It completely didn‚Äôt need to exist.

Now though, we‚Äôre stuck with it, and racism is a thing. It‚Äôs not based on our ‚Äúrace,‚Äù no, but our ethnicity. I don‚Äôt care what people call it personally, I just want people to stop assuming shit about me because of the way I was born.

This is the same view we need to have on sex. Whether or not you think it‚Äôs dimorphic, immutable, total bullshit, people of a certain sex are disproportionately murdered and dehumanized because of something they can‚Äôt change entirely. You can take hormones and shift it all you‚Äôd like, but the world has been set up to promote one and debase the other.

Most people aren‚Äôt paying attention to how exactly you line up within one previously determined category of biological sex. They‚Äôre trying to figure out if you‚Äôre a man or a woman so they can decide how to treat you, and that‚Äôs what we should be focusing on."
4854,anonymousmarxist,"you totally seemed to have missed my point entirely... thats exactly what i was pointing out. that people vary by skin color, which is just biological fact, but that race is a social construct, a group of actual traits that do exist, but which are subjectively grouped together for the benefit of another social group.  just like every gendered trait is a trait that people actually possess, but which is grouped together subjectively for the benefit of another group."
4855,Far-Air,Sorry. You're drawing an analogy to race with the idea that the *sex* example is flawed because you believe race doesn't exist. I'm saying the logic doesn't carry over to sex.
4856,peregrine_throw,"I was thinking of Jewish and NA people when I mentioned ethnicity.

I am aware of the arguments saying an individual's race is not strictly dictated by biology (e.g. how much melanin you have validates if you're black or not), but as a class, I'd say it is defined by it, by genetics and ancestral lineage specifically. Similar to Native American tracing of ancestry to avail of government resources exclusive to them.  Otherwise, if race isn't real, Dolezal is as black as any person and shouldn't have been kicked out of NAACP. In fact, there shouldn't even be NAACP to begin with if race has no material basis. 

>I don't understand what this means. Can you clarify?

A nonbinary may not disbelieve bio sex, but then claim it is sexism/because she's female and is why, in her IT team of all men and her, only she got a 2% salary increase and everyone else got 5%.

I don't think sex is BS, so I wouldn't know how they'd respond. I only made the modest point that disbelieving is sex does not *necessitate* disbelieving in sexism... It is a *coherent* position to believe that sexism is based on a fiction or construct...

4863,anonymousmarxist,"dworkin put it very succinctly: ""gender is real, but its not true"". she said its true that a system of oppression exists based on one's biological sex, but its not true that people are psychologically or mentally predisposed to certain behaviors just based on that fact alone.  its putting the cart before the horse to say ""see! men and women act different and thats because of their sex organs!""  no, its more like ""men and women act different because even before they are born they are immediately tracked into a gender role upon first learning their sex""."

4867,Saoirse7077,"Sigh... all I'm saying is that the **attitude** one takes towards race is also possible to be taken towards sex if one believes it to be a construct. People who deny sex are not logically necessitated into denying sexism.

4870,Saoirse7077,Ah thanks for the clarification!
4871,Saoirse7077,"I don't follow why you think that. Why does the truth of race have anything to do with whether people are treated differently on the basis of it?

Race doesn't have to be a legitimate biological category for oppression to be based on it.

To use another example. Caste is truly a social construct with no biological basis. But people are absolutely oppressed on the basis of their position in a caste system"
4872,Far-Air,"Someone who doesn't believe in race would think people are being treated differently *not* on the basis of race, but on the basis of *other people faultily believing in a nonexistent concept*. [This distinction doesn't negate the person from seeing the resulting *oppression* as real regardless]"
4873,Saoirse7077,"No, they are being oppressed on their race, which is a fiction imposed on them by others... Race ""exists"", just not as a genuine biological category. That's still racism. 

The idea that race (at least the ""traditional"" races) has a biological basis is almost unheard of in modern philosophical and scientific circles. [You can read here for more info](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/race/)"
4874,Far-Air,"So, if you define race as a 'fiction', then what you're saying is that they believe in fiction-based oppression rather than race-based oppression.

And I'm making no claims one way or the other if race as we define it is real.

But to go back to the actual point of the post-- people who think *sex* is fiction are therefore believing in fiction-based oppression rather than sex-based oppression as we define sex. So I don't consider the term 'sexism' to be genuine by those using it to actually mean fiction-ism."

What is your definition of a woman? Because mine is having women‚Äôs internal organs and XX chromosomes. Everything else is literally made up by society. 

It sounds to me like your definition of a woman is someone who wears feminine clothing and enjoys feminine things and I cannot think of a more offensive definition. Being a woman has nothing to do with feelings or clothes or preferences. Society told us girls like pink and glitter and we followed, but girls existed apart from boys before pink and glitter did. Women were raped and killed by men simply for being women before pink and glitter existed. 

Those ‚Äúwomen‚Äù you‚Äôre talking about are men who decided they didn‚Äôt like or do the things society *told* them to do. They are going against *society* not biology. They‚Äôre gender non-conforming, but their sex is still male. 

The fact that men will become violent towards someone who is not like them is not women‚Äôs problem. But the fact that men have been using their size and strength against women for millennia is women‚Äôs problem. If men won‚Äôt accept their own, the women‚Äôs bathroom should not be their refuge, because the women‚Äôs bathroom is a refuge and safe space for *women,* the ones with female internal organs and XX chromosomes, the ones that are at a physical disadvantage and in a vulnerable position (as in with their pants literally down). To allow a person with the build and possibly genitalia of a man puts every woman in the bathroom at a physical disadvantage and it is no longer a safe place for women."

I‚Äôve done an interview with two newspapers about this and in the process of writing articles for many different publications.  I have started an online group for abused women, and women only because that‚Äôs how a lot of us feel safer. 

I am a ‚Äùfeminism movement‚Äù. I believe the abuse of women is a hate crime against women and should be treated that way. I believe strangulation isn‚Äôt assault, it‚Äôs attempted murder.

4961,LeCuldeSac,"Document, document, document. 

If he's as narcissistic as you're making out, he's going to try to demand unsupervised visitation after you go through the hell of birth and early infancy, which is the last thing you want.

He'll have access to the trans-lobby as he gaslights you, but everything you do NOW to document abuse, drinking and drugging, mental illness, what have you---will help you demonstrate he's an unsuitable parent. You DO NOT want him taking care of your 2-year-olds, once he decides they're cute and he wants to use them as a prop on social media. 

Get out in front of this now. If he's drinking and driving, call the police and get his arrested. If he has illegal drugs, do the same. If he assaults or threatens you, prosecute. 

And I hope you can find a face to face support group. God bless. "
4962,ahcabot,"A great place for you to get support (in addition to here) is I believe there‚Äôs a Trans Widows forum on mumsnet for other women who have been abandoned by trans identified male partners.

I‚Äôm so sorry for what you‚Äôre going through right now."
4963,PlumRavenPie,"Your pregnancy makes him dysphoric, but fucking you with his male genitalia didn't make him dysphoric? Oh my god I can't get over how manipulative these slimy men are. I'm so sorry this happened to you. I actually got pregnant with a trans identified male myself and they really show their hatred for women once reality sets in. My ex even refused to go with me to my first obgyn appointment and had a tantrum, threatening to kill himself because I assumed he would join me and his mother instead of asking. I hope there are resources available in your area to help you care for you and your children, I wish you all the best."
4964,applestrudelterf,"‚ÄúA real woman can‚Äôt just run away‚Äù

Absolutely THIS. This is one of the core aspects of the trans ideology that grinds my gears so fucking much. It has to be the ULTIMATE expression of male privilege to sire children then sack off before they are even born, and then, dump a whole dump truck‚Äôs worth of salt in the wound by appropriating the label of womanhood, *and claiming biology doesn‚Äôt matter*!!!!! The whole thing is so enraging!

We women spend our *whole teenage and adult lives* worrying about our reproductive system and the absolutely ginormous impact it can have on our life, socially, economically, health wise, career-wise, absolutely every aspect. Whether we are doing all we can to try and avoid pregnancy, seeking contraception in a place that tries to make it difficult, seeking an abortion, counting the days in the calendar trying to work out if our period is late or not, actively trying to get pregnant, suffering from fertility problems, menopause, dealing with discrimination in the workplace because our employers think we will become pregnant even if we have no intention of, the ‚Äòmotherhood‚Äô career penalty, living with the physical consequences of pregnancy complications years later, the list goes on and on and on and on. 

The sheer audacity to call yourself a woman whilst doing the one thing only a man can do... running away from the pregnancy you caused... shameful."

4966,,I can't think of anything more MALE than abandoning a woman you impregnated.
4967,GnomesHateCheese,">Now, a few months later I'm pregnant. With twins. Apparently this makes them so dysphoric that they no longer want to be with me

To me this sounds like nothing more than a translation of ""I don't find you sexy anymore that you're pregnant and I don't want to deal with being a parent either so I'm just going to ditch you"".

I don't buy that he's all of a sudden so horribly dysphoric that he HAS to leave. He's just using it as an excuse to run away from his responsibilities as the father of your twins. Especially since his ""dysphoria"" didn't prevent him from knocking you up in the first place.

He's a useless, immature deadbeat and while I know everything is really hard right now, I believe firmly that in the long run you will be better off without him. He would likely never pull his weight even if he stuck around and you'd end up with 3 dependants instead of 2.

He's in the wrong. You're in the right. He's an asshole.

&#x200B;

>I should have known better.

I firmly believe we're not guilty of anything when we expect others to act in good faith. The shame in this situation is not yours. It's his. ALL his.

&#x200B;

ETA: I'm not going to get into the speculation over whether he's actually a closet, homophobic homosexual or not. I think it's irrelevant to the main point, which is that this man has got a woman into a really shitty position and then refuses to do anything to help, but instead buggers off to do ""his thing"", whatever that thing is. Whatever his motivations are, he's using the dysphoria as an excuse to get out of the situation. "
4968,DepressedCactus5324,A man knocked me up and a few months after the abortion transitioned to living as a woman. These people fetishize the fantasy of being a woman. They have no idea what we go though. I'm so sorry.
4969,DykeWithANutAllergy,"You might be angry now, but wait until you see him describe himself as a mother despite not taking on any of the responsibilities of one. 

There‚Äôs a good trans widows thread on mumsnet where they all describe pretty much the same thing. Initially masculine acting man comes out as trans and then rapidly makes everything about transition, abandoning all responsibilities and completely altering their personality. It‚Äôs the new midlife crisis, but instead of running off with a young girl they try to become one. The general consensus is that they‚Äôre better off cutting him out ASAP, otherwise you‚Äôd see the household expenses all go on miniskirts and panties, and have to deal with all the emotional labour he suddenly needs."

You tried your best for your partner, and they tossed you aside. If I were you, I'd work on building up a support network offline too so you aren't alone for your pregnancy. If you plan on keeping the children, see if you can get child support from your ex."
4976,swizzySWERF,"""I can't do that because dysphoria,"" is starting to sound like this generation's, ""I'm lazy and irresponsible and only want to have fun all the time.""

If you are in the US, contact Planned Parenthood.  They offer wellness services for pregnant women (not just abortions) and they might be able to point you at other sources of support.

OP, you are the strong one.  You supported this person, helped him, even through your doubts.  This person can't tolerate anything that isn't perfect, and responds by rejecting you.  Don't blame yourself for being strong, for being the adult, for being kind."
4977,EquivalentApple,"Fuck that piece of shit. He's scum. Get angry with him so you can get through this, repressing your natural anger sucks your will to live. Do scream. Scream into a pillow if you've got close neighbours. Punch things. I think some of your depression comes from the extent to which he gaslighted and brainwashed you. Getting angry with him will help.

Then reach out to someone. Have you got any family or friends you can go to for help?

And this may be a terrible idea but I'd consider telling the truth about his behavior on social media if I were you. it sounds like you haven't got much to lose, it could be cathartic and maybe someone will reach out to help you.

The good thing about emergencies like the one you're in is that the need to survive can help you focus. I'm not in the USA but the link below has  some resources for pregnant women in poverty. One step at a time, one foot in front of the other. If you're still feeling tempted towards suicide,  *imagine how much your piece of shit ex would enjoy the attention if you did it.*  He'd be able to cast himself as a tragic heroine for the rest of his life.   Do not allow him an opportunity to co-opt your death like he co-opted your life.

In my opinion, he‚Äôs jealous of the attention you‚Äôre getting as a pregnant woman, and he‚Äôll be even more jealous of the attention the baby will get."
4989,RFANA,"I‚Äôm so sorry OP. You deserve a supportive partner but instead were completely bamboozled. I doubt any of us could have seen that coming.

 This is one of the number one reasons I‚Äôm adamantly against allowing males into female sexed spaces and female institutions- the pregnancy risk. It‚Äôs EXTREMELY irresponsible for an institution to create the conditions that allow for a woman to get pregnant when she is most vulnerable- women in crisis shelters should not be faced with pregnancy risk *inside their bunk*, even if they WANT to have sex with this guy, it‚Äôs not right the institution putting them in this position.

 Similarly, what your child‚Äôs *father* is doing is NOT RIGHT. He is being incredibly self-centered, typical male socialization. There are two people whose needs come before his now, but he‚Äôs worried about how he doesn‚Äôt like his penis, just like so many other deadbeat dads. Transpeople who father or mother children but still claim to be the opposite sex are absolutely *the most delusional*.  I also got duped into believing that men who have fathered children can up and *feel like a woman*. UGH. 

I hope you get all the support to do what you need, and if you carry to term, I‚Äôm happy to point you to some resources for suing him for child support (if USA), which is not a punishment or revenge, but what your children deserve and have a right to. I‚Äôm sure all the court paperwork that says ‚Äúpaternity establishment‚Äù and ‚Äúfather‚Äù will make him really dysphoric but that‚Äôs real life "

4992,FuzzyFakeFur,"The best piece of advice I received when I was leaving my abusive ex was to sign up for food stamps and Medicaid.  You may be eligible to receive TANF because you're pregnant, but I am not certain.  Do it as soon as you can, and then file for divorce. Trust me, it is HARD to do, but it will be so so so worth it in the long run. "
4993,Annelie2,"Hey so I can relate to that, while my boyfriend of that time wasn't a TIM, he left me because he didn't want a baby. I've been left alone with the pregnancy and was shamed for it; as if it would've been alone my fault. I went to court to sue him for children support but he only paid the bare minimum. I put my daughter in a nursery when she was half a year old and continued to work. It was rough but the hard times did pass, I remember having mental breakdowns almost every day because I was so stressed - don't be afraid to ask friends for help! I didn't have many friends at that time but I found through an announce in the newspaper a student who majored in child care, she supported me as a babysitter so I could work in the evenings sometimes (babysitters are easier to get if you look out for girls like that). If you search for a kindergarten place, look out for those who are opened long. Some are only until 1 pm; some until 7 pm. I was actually able to demand half of the money for the kindergarten from the ""father"". I don't know if thats possible in your country though. With my financial struggles I got in contact with the church and their organisations, they sell cheap clothes in goodwill etc and while I am absolutely not happy with religion, a friendly community member was able to explain me how to get the best support and everything. Hope that helped a little bit! I am sure you will make it. Reach out for other women! "

4996,gencritthrowwww,"Honestly, if you see this as ""ruining my life"" and an ""utter shit storm"" I think you should consider abortion, or adoption if you're too late to abort. Raising a kid by yourself is tough as shit already, but adding one more infant and negotiating with such a self-serving father? Sounds bad.  


Please don't blame yourself. You thought you were doing the right thing and you didn't know he would abandon you."
4997,Nibbana0,"Oh well, if he earns a living he has to pay child support, there are good supportive people out there, take what you know now and surround your children with them.

Many of us are indeed ""radical"", the difference is that the ""radical"" in radical feminism is intended to mean *root* and not extremist.

5002,,"**(((I echo all the sympathy and empathy here. All the love you think you lost, and more than you can ever imagine, is about to fill your life. You‚Äôre heart is about to grow so big no one can ever break it again.)))**

Planned Parenthood in my area (in the south) only provides abortions. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a funding cut or we have too many pregnant women or what... so beware you may find that. And don‚Äôt let it get you down. Medicaid is an option and you can even look for a obgyn with a midwife on the roster. I had one when I was on Medicaid and pregnant. 

TANF, WIC and Section 8. You should qualify for all of them. Get whatever you can. I got a lot of free diapers and baby things from Catholic Charities, call around and see who‚Äôs got programs for single mothers. You have to act fast bc as soon as you actually have the baby, some of the opportunities will dry up. If you want to DM me your town and state I will search for resources for you myself while you rest.üñ§

My mom did something with one of her children and while I initially thought it was crazy, it worked for her. If you‚Äôre not going to go through the family court system, maybe you wanna consider asking him to sign over his rights. Pretend you are doing it so he doesn‚Äôt have to think about this ever again, as a ‚Äúfavor‚Äù to him. Draft a legal document and have him sign it. I heard that he still can even be made to pay child support even with signing over his rights. Even if you *do* end up going to court, get him to sign something saying he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with the burden of fatherhood, then use it as proof of his attitude at this time. You can show a progression of abandonment and then potentially how he has completely changed his mind and become antagonistic or tries to dominate you and his children. It‚Äôs an option of more documentation. 

Cortisol is not good for you rn. Try to fill yourself with love as much as you can. Focus on things you love right now. He doesn‚Äôt even deserve your anger. Anger is just going to hurt your body, raise your bp, make your impulse control worse. Practice deep breathing and surround yourself with whatever you can to make you happy. Oh. And walk tons for your labor so it can go easy. When you‚Äôre mad or sad or bored, walk. Physical activity is as effective as an antidepressant and it‚Äôs got no side effects on a fetus.

You got this Queenüêù Bee!

5006,Oburcuk,HE is a piece of shit human. I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through this. 
5007,little_bear_,"I am so, so sorry you are going through this. You deserve SO much better. 

I don't have much insight aside from what the women here have already said. One thing I do want to mention is you should start planning for the future now. I know you're overwhelmed, but there are simple things you can do right now to make things easier on yourself in the future. 

You should find out about your state's laws in terms of recording stuff and see whether you're in a one or two party consent state. If you must communicate with each other, it should be in writing. If he calls you, let it go to voicemail(AFAIK voicemail is admissible in court even in two-party states because the person leaving the message knows they are being recorded). 

Get a composition notebook or a notebook with binding(any notebook where the pages can't easily be torn out) and start documenting his abusive behaviors now. Date, time, place, everything. This will not only help you build a case, but it will also protect you in the event he comes back and tries to suck you back in. Narcissists try to ""hoover"" their victims back once they have been discarded by showering them with love and affection. Victims of narcissistic abuse are conditioned to respond to this ""love bombing"" technique, but if you have a written record of the horrible things he's done, you can refer back to it whenever you feel tempted to go back to him. 

In any case, you want to start laying the groundwork for your side ASAP in the event he comes back in the future and tries to get custody/visitation with your kids. 

I know it is overwhelming, but this might help you reassert some measure of control over your life. First and foremost, please take care of yourself and know that this community and many others are here for you anytime you need support or just a shoulder to cry on. 

Best wishes <3"

5010,St_God,"PERSONALLY, if I were in your position I'd abort. A custody battle with a deranged cross dresser who has the public narrative on their side is going to be something I wouldn't wish on anyone. Dare this person get any kind of visitation and who knows if the children will end up abused.

If that's not an option, skip town, change your name, move to a different country or at the VERY LEAST, do not put him on the birth certificate or pursue child support. Have him terminate his rights as soon as possible if you don't want to leave.

Either way, be on the defensive from now foreward"

This seems to have happened a lot, though some men act as a father for a while or even years before ditching them to live their porn-fueled fantasies because their online friends have been egging them on."
5014,lala4now,I'm so sorry you're going through this. The fact is that your pregnancy doesn't HAVE to make your partner feel dysphoric. There are lesbian couples where one of them gets pregnant with donor sperm. Honestly I'd leave the guy and sue for child support. You deserve better.

5016,jelliknight,"Sorry this happened to you. You're not the only one. Even this basic story is familiar because they want to be the center of attention (you doing his hair, telling him he's brave, getting his medication, taking care of him) and then you get pregnant and suddenly you genuinely need some attention. He can't tolerate that so he leaves to find someone who will pamper him.

He is a dead beat. Is there any way to get his parental rights terminated? I feel really bad for the kids who will have to deal with him traipsing in and out of his life and using them for his own validation (heads up, if he gets visitation he will probably demand your kids call him 'mommy' too) and it might be easier to get him to sign paperwork now while it's all hypothetical and save you some trouble later on. I don't know. I would speak to a family lawyer.  


ETA: I usually don't make strong statements about other people's relationships because we never know the full story but UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU CONSIDER TAKING HIM BACK. Even if he was to drop the woman act today everything he's done so far has been narcissistic abuse. He waited until you were at your most vulnerable before dropping this. It was NOT an accident that he 'suddenly' feels too dysphoric to support you (but not too dysphoric to fuck you without a condom), now that he suddenly has a permanent avenue through which he can control you. He will drag you back and forth through the courts and try to control you using your children. This was always the plan."

5020,MyCat8it2,"I read your story two days ago and it has haunted me ever since. 

Instead of screaming, ""Deadbeat Dad"" scream something that will hit him in the feels.

""A woman would never do this to her children.""

This is the part that has been haunting me. Transwomen are always screaming about how much they ""feel"" like a woman, but they don't act like women. They have no idea what feeling like a woman is because they will never be one. It's not all about dresses, heels, periods, and monthly cramps. We are living, breathing, emotional, and complex human beings. 

Women don't run out on their children. Women don't threaten rape with spiked broom handles. And women don't crumble in the face of adversity. You never know the strength of a woman until she is put to the test such as you have been.

5052,princess_myshkin,"*golf clap* This was everything, thank you for putting my argument into words. 

What always bothered me about the ‚ÄúI *feel* like a woman‚Äù ideology is that being a woman means facing a barrage of discrimination and difficulties every goddamn day. What does it mean to feel like a woman? It‚Äôs more than just makeup and dresses. And as feminists, we have fought so hard to be considered equal to men, because we don‚Äôt necessarily feel any different. We just... are women. 

You can‚Äôt say you want to be part of our world and not understand the advantages you have for being born with a penis. I‚Äôll bet this sack of garbage goes to some chat room or group therapy and whines about how it‚Äôs so unfair to him because *he* can‚Äôt get pregnant himself, and how hurt he feels about it. I love how women have been typecast as being ‚Äútoo emotional to be in politics/science/etc‚Äù but all I‚Äôm seeing lately is a bunch of men being whiny-ass babies. 

I only know a little bit about custody laws, but I really hope for OP‚Äôs sake that this guy doesn‚Äôt try and come back later and claim custody over the babies he abandoned. I would think that based on his ‚Äúdysphoria‚Äù, hormone treatments, and general behavior at the moment, the OP could claim he is mentally unfit if it ever came to that. 

Maybe that ideal of mine isn‚Äôt exactly kosher. But for me, feeling like a woman is overcoming barriers in my career field. I‚Äôm getting my PhD in physics, which is overwhelmingly dominated by men. For me, being a woman feels like being depressed for the past 1.5 months because I didn‚Äôt pass my candidacy exams that I studied so hard for, and apparently none of the other women in my program did either. 

It feels like being reprimanded at work for taking a day off because of my period, and then told to ‚Äúget that shit together‚Äù in the future. It feels like having endometriosis that I can‚Äôt have surgery for so I just have to manage the pain. It means massive hormone swings, days that I can‚Äôt get out of bed, but sucking it up anyways with a smile because taking time off for a women problem makes me look bad. It means that I may not be able to have children, but everyone is already judging me for being in my mid-20‚Äôs and getting my PhD and having no immediate perspectives of having a kid anyways. 

Didn‚Äôt mean to just go and talk about myself there and divert from OP‚Äôs problem, I‚Äôm just speaking about my own experience, which is all I can do. On the plus side for me, there aren‚Äôt exactly any TIMs in the scientific field, so work-wise I won‚Äôt have to deal with this kind of fuckery. 

"
5053,Critical_Percentage,"I echo that, hard. Its very interesting talking to trans women who just tell me to casually abort or adopt, and downplay how hard pregnancy can actually be. If they understood what it was like they would understand it's not an easy decision, there are mood swings, there is depression and periods of elation, there is an attachment and losing a child is fucking devastating. I've miscarried before and the pain was like nothing I have ever felt before. I have had nightmares and dreams about the child I never had from three years ago. The emotional toll is not something that is easily translatable yet mothers get held up to such a high standard and we're supposed to just flawlessly eat the pain. I'm not flawless and I'm fucking terrified. "

Our household expenses previously got devoted to their transition so I can imagine. The short time they were around while I was pregnant I would occasionally complain about things like fatigue and morning sickness but never once did I get any comfort. I simply got a sad response of ""I feel sick too."" There was no empathy, no care, they never once helped me prepare a meal or held my hair when I vomited or even took over cleaning, etc. They even smoked around me until I forced them to smoke outside, which they constantly backpedaled on. Nevermind that smoking hurts the effects of their hormones that we spent a ton of money on... I would often dig deeper and try to illicit some kind of caring response which in turn made them focus in on themselves even harder then eventually I would end up comforting them instead. I never got to have a single moment of comfort because it was all overshadowed by the transition, how much they dislike their job or their illnesses that only seemed to occur when I was feeling ill myself."

5089,CricketNiche,"Honestly this is what I would do, and actually *did,* to get away from my abuser. I was pretty close to being unable in my state, but I got an appointment at the last minute. It saved my life. Seriously.

  


I had to weigh the cost of the abortion, mental/physical/financial, vs the cost of having to engage with an abusive narcissist who is addicted to BDSM and child porn for the rest of my life. I literally couldn't bear the thought of ever leaving the child alone with him, it would destroy me every time I imagined sharing custody, for obvious reasons. He would abuse them as badly as he did me and everything around him, PLUS the fear of my child getting raped or molested by their father.

  


So it *can* be a very difficult decision. Sometimes plans completely change, men completely change during a pregnancy-- and not for the better-- and it makes the previous choices not the best one anymore. It can be hard when you want a pregnancy, but the person it's with poses a direct danger to the child, or any other dangerous or poor circumstances.

  


This situation, and my own, is the reason I oppose term limits on abortion. We can't possibly draw such a hard line in the sand, life doesn't work that way. Things change, sometimes things go very very wrong. Women should never be trapped because they made the choice earlier on to keep it when circumstances were different.

  


But whatever OP chooses, I wish them the best."

I'm not happy about the GOP being in charge, but if you have a local state senator or rep who's right-wing (more likely if you're near Wilmington and were affected by the hurricanes) you'll probably have a better chance of having them intervene for you if necessary. And/or if you get involved in a moderately conservative church (no need to go to crazy awful right-wingers, but just old-fashioned traditional people), they'll bend over backwards to support you if you're pregnant and left by a transgender man. They'll be happy you're keeping the pregnancy."
5098,rubythieves,"Very true. I went through a custody evaluation with my ex a while back because I wanted to move further away for a job, and my primary custody status disintegrated, legally speaking, because my son went to preschool. As in, I had him 12 days out of every 14, but the ten days he was in preschool didn‚Äôt count as being in ‚Äúmy custody,‚Äù so we were evaluated as if custody were 50/50 based on the weekends only. So all the mornings I dragged us out of bed, all the evenings I bathed and fed him, the tuition I paid for his preschool... it meant nothing. I would have been in a better position if I had never let my then four-year-old have any early education at all.

I have been to PP many times. I was just there with my little sister last week. Though a lot of their literature is transactivist in nature, most staff certainly aren't. If OP needs to go there, she doesn't have to discuss why her husband left, or even that he left at all. "

I live in a state in the US where one church basically runs the state: from health care to public policy. What they want, they get. And unfortunately, this church views birth control as a sin. Because of this, most health insurances in this state do not cover reproductive health for women. My insurance is no different. To get birth control at a regular doctor‚Äôs office would cost me  a pretty penny that I don‚Äôt have because I would have to pay entirely out of pocket. I would have to pay about $400 to just SEE my doctor and then almost $1,000 for the birth control I wanted (an IUD).

What I am certain about is that you want to keep a financial and other (maybe audio record, conversations, voicemail, email, screenshots of messenger conversations) of your ex-partner abdicating in his responsibility as a parent and causing you undue stress (doctor‚Äôs note). You want to have proof in a custody battle that he is an unfit parent, and a child isn‚Äôt a photo prop for Instagram when it seems convenient for him to want to reclaim rights for selfish attention seeking reasons.

Perhaps record a call where you get him to admit your pregnancy is too inconvenient to him, and that he doesn‚Äôt plan to come back to support you because he mentally can‚Äôt even handle the idea of you being pregnant. Get all this on record. Save this and upload copies to google drive, drop box, and burn to CD.

If the OP has relatives or friends in another state, she should go. NOT after the babies are born, then she could easily lose them for kidnapping her own children. But before the birth, somewhere he won‚Äôt follow, or can‚Äôt follow within six months of their birth? Go! 

Also: exclusive breastfeeding. Either do it or say you‚Äôre doing it, and can‚Äôt pump. Courts are loath to take breastfeeding babes from moms for even an overnight.

I'm sure you know that a lot of organizations that focus on WOMEN'S HEALTH have to pander to trans bullshit so they can keep their funding, right? 

Have you ever been to a Planned Parenthood????

PP is a valuable, affordable, and hopefully to a lot of women, accessible resource. When I was there asking for birth control, they were very informative, and talked to me in private to MAKE SURE I WASN'T BEING ABUSED OR CONTROLLED. That's so important. 

They're already having to fight against conservatives wanting to defund them. Then they have to put up with the threat of defunding if they don't comply with the demand of trans stuff, like what happened with the Vancouver Crisis Center.

Ask your OB or nurses to sign that he was not present at checkups or the birth. Keep every email, text or voicemail from him (and watch what you send back, you need to be on your best behavior in any potential custody sutuation.) Check the laws in your state for recording phone calls or in-person conversations without the other party‚Äôs permission, and if you can do it, get him on the record saying these cruel or dismissive or crazy things. Cultivate your friendships, especially with people who also knew him - you‚Äôre going to need those character witnesses if you end up in court. And of course, no excessive drinking or taking drugs, even if the greeen stuff is legal in your state (the family courts don‚Äôt give a damn about your medical license, I can assure you.)

I went through a very unexpected and nasty divorce, and my biggest mistake re: custody was crawling into my shell and just wanting my time with my very young son to be just the two of us and no one else. My ex had half-a-dozen other preschool parents who could say ‚Äúoh yes, we‚Äôve have play dates in the park with mr exruby and little ruby‚Äù or ‚ÄúMr exruby seems confident and outgoing, but ruby seems quiet and timid and not very strong‚Äù (no shit, I was trying to survive the collapse of an abusive marriage).

My ex was eventually stupid/hubristic enough to make a false drug/alcohol addiction accusation against me (guess what? They take that stuff very seriously, so when someone is accused but then tests clean for six months and volunteers to do another six months if the court wants more proof, they take the lie very seriously, too) and I won primary custody, but I was so lucky he was that stupid. Everything else ‚Äòvisible‚Äô or able to be proved with evidence and eyewitnesses made him the better parent, because I was so devastated by my husband leaving me that I much preferred spending my time with my son just together in our little apartment, playing games and reading books and not enrolling him in after-school classes that promised to make him a tech genius aged three. But the court can‚Äôt see your amazing bonding time at home. You need the receipts that you were there, you parented like a crazy person as is the American way (Yes, immigrant here), and that he wasn‚Äôt interested.

Best of luck, honestly. You will get to a happy place. It probably won‚Äôt be happy 100% of the time, but very few things are.

I couldn't get my ex to even apply for jobs on their own or take over paying a single bill or even go grocery shopping.

It's one set of imperfections vs another (not talking about scary promise-keeper churches, but just more traditional ones).

I do believe in a ""power greater than myself"" but consider Christ a metaphor. Churches are just helpful structures in the US anyway through which to channel some the needs for spiritual community and service. I've learned to mistrust Buddhist temple groups because they seem to be full of men on the make who use a lot of unfamiliar language to get women to distrust their instincts. I know others are agnostic and atheistic.

Transgender people (both TIMs and TIFs - especially TIFs) do not adhere to their adopted gender's ROLES.

Some of them fetishize housewives by dressing up like June Cleaver, but nothing they're doing is meant to create a warm, spotless home with the smell of *actual* cookies baking.  Few of them talk about giving up their lives to change dirty diapers.

""Legitimacy"" isn't the correct word.  I have pointed out several times on this sub:  If you go to all those ""flyover"" states, if you go to rural Amreica ... you will find women who do NOT perform superficial womanhood.  Women with short, masculine haircuts.  Women who NEVER wear makeup or dresses.  Women who are expected to perform all the same tasks the men do.  Men who teach their daughters the same things they teach their sons.  I am not saying rural America is perfect, I'm not saying they're gender critical.  But when I leave my city every year on road trips to rural America, I am reminded of how people in cities clearly have no idea what's going on in rural, mostly conservative, areas.

5220,girl_undone,"""Liberal"" has a couple of meanings.

In general in America and maybe similarly in some other countries, ""liberal"" means ""progressive"" which also gets associated with the Democratic and Green parties.

In general in Europe and some other countries elsewhere, ""liberal"" means something more like ""conservative"" does in America. It refers to people who want free-market capitalism and less taxation.

If you went back 100 years, or were referring to political factions 100-300 years ago, a liberal would refer to a person who supported democratic republics, states with constitutions that defined the rights of their citizens, and capitalist economics. Contrast them to socialists, supporters of monarchy, supporters of various despotic rulers, and fascists.

Radical feminism was started by women with Marxist/socialist backgrounds, so radical means ""to the root"", not extreme. The last definition of liberal is the one that is relevant when we talk about ""liberal feminism."" We're talking about feminism that seeks to make women ""equal citizens"" within the liberal socioeconomic system that exists, but they don't want to radically change the system. Liberal feminists are reformists. Radical feminists don't believe women can be ""equal"" in liberalism at all, and seek to overthrow all patriarchal systems, including liberal ones."

No it's not. Most broadly, political conservatism serves to maintain (or ""conserve"") the *status quo*, whatever it may be, which entails a particular economic system and a set of norms/mores.

Not really. You may think that because of the American right wing, which identifies as conservative but also has a strong right-libertarian streak. The personal liberty aspect belongs to the libertarianism side, not really to conservatism. In fact conservatism tends towards authoritarianism, which is the opposite of personal liberty.

Another political philosophy that emphasizes personal liberty is classic liberalism (look it up, it's not what American right wingers call a lib'rul.)"

5239,4eyedPurplePPLeater,">Also, it's hard to define the GCF viewpoint in regards to sports. Whether there should be separate leagues for the sexes or one coed league (for lack of a better term) since there is no gender. It's especially more confused and confusing, now that TiMs are becoming younger and younger and the laws of different lands are inconsistent and countries and counties seemingly don't know what to do about trans identified athletes in regards to amateur and school sports.            

By ""gender"", we mean the stereotypes (gender roles, behaviors, etc.) associated with someone's sex. ""Gender"" is simply a social construct (girls like pink, boys like cars, women should stay at home, while men should be the breadwinners, etc.)  The word gender has been used interchangeably with sex, but that wasn't the original intention.         

As far as spaces, sports, etc., they should be separated by sex, as they always have been. Women fought very hard to have these spaces because they were left out (sports), and/or vulnerable (dressing rooms). Separate spaces ensured some level of safety, a way to participate in both public life, & activities usually reserved for men.        

There already are plenty of co-ed leagues for people just interested in playing if it's just a matter of getting to participate in some type of athletics. However, competitive sports need separation by sex -- both at the lower levels & top levels, otherwise, girls/ women will be pushed out by males that have biological advantages. No one says trans athletes shouldn't get to play sports, just that they should play with the appropriate sex. The younger cases of trans people going into sports really highlights the problem, when you see males just self declaring they are ""girls"" & getting onto teams. Several have now broke records & this just got started.         

What people are failing to realize is that issues, like playing sports with the opposite sex because of feelings, is not some human right. There's a lot of factors that could impede, or conflict with an athlete's ability to compete... sometimes it's just unfortunate, or the result of choices made, but it's not right to make athletic organizations accept any individual, especially when it would make it unfair to an entire class of people (women/ girls.)"
5240,fairycanary,"It‚Äôs not really confusing. Don‚Äôt really care about how they go about making new leagues, but men have no business competing in women‚Äôs only sports because of the innate biological advantage.

Sure a portion of women are stronger than some men, but just as some teens are stronger than some adults too, doesn‚Äôt mean a grown adult should be allowed to compete against kids.

If that adult purposefully stunted their own growth, that‚Äôs their problem and still doesn‚Äôt allow them to compete against kids."

Gender critical persons, as I understand it, deny any legitimacy to genders, as they are a harmful social construct. However it seems that this subs emphasizes a lot the biological aspect, and considers people with different biologies fairly differently, which seems, in the end, recreating genders, since different biologies gets you different social consideration?"
5251,villanelle23eve,"THIS. Although, maybe some do experience them, and we're just soulless."
5252,eilidhinalbion,"Thanks for his explanation. Can you tell me if I‚Äôve got the right idea here about gender-critical feminism:

Sex = biological. Gender = performative(?), socially constructed.

I have spent years learning about socially constructed gender roles and how damaging they are for both women and men. I‚Äôve been of the belief that these gender roles shouldn‚Äôt be placed as ‚Äúin line‚Äù with the sex of a person. 
For example: wearing a dress (categorised as feminine) is in line with being a biological woman and it is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúnatural‚Äù by society‚Äôs standards. I‚Äôve been championing for more women to join football teams, I‚Äôm a teacher and I regularly point out everyday sexism in class and how ‚Äúgirls can like blue‚Äù, ‚Äúboys can wear dresses‚Äù, etc. I challenge the stereotypes that people around me say in everyday conversation. Basically - I consider myself a feminist. 

However. What I‚Äôm taking from the gender critical movement is that with the trans community become more vocal and accepted, there is a hypocrisy in the above theory. If I tell boys in my class that it‚Äôs okay to wear a dress, then why do trans men (MtF) feel the need to identify as women because they like to wear dresses? Isn‚Äôt the point of being a feminist that you don‚Äôt want gender roles and stereotypes to exist? By allowing that biological male to identify as a women because he likes makeup, wearing pink and other traditionally ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô things, doesn‚Äôt that undermine the whole movement away from gender stereotypes?! Accepting MtF as ‚Äòwomen‚Äô confirms that only those who are women can wear dresses?

My head is a mess. I‚Äôm trying to get my head around this.

Any help would be appreciate here!!!!"

 I am sorry that you see a lot of it, it is more common to see in babies and preschoolers, but that is usually because they are not able to hide the disjunction as well or cannot hide it at all (babies) outside their oarents' influence. As you say it presents more strongly when children are with parent. However, the present you describe is not necessarily the case. Neither does the reasoning in your post re surgery to be honest, it doesn't really make sense to me - could you expand? Many MBP cases are with children groomed into it from a very early age and they take on the narratives themselves. 

Jazz was homeschooled parts of his childhood then I think permanently after a certain age. He would have been with his mother constantly. Would not be necessarily have it as a primary diagnostic though.

Not sexual reproduction, silly boys. Not the material reality of our biology, which exists whether or not we can describe it with words or study it with science."
5270,Caranda23,"> However it seems that this subs emphasizes a lot the biological aspect,

This is how I see it: the biological aspect is that men and women have different roles in reproduction, in particular, that only women menstruate, can get pregnant, bear the foetus, give birth and breastfeed.  That different role results in some different physiology between males and females.  Denying that this biological difference exists would be to deny reality.  But that's the extent of the biological difference. 

This biological difference does lead to some social consequences but that's unavoidable and need not be a bad thing.  For example, it's not intrinsically wrong that society treats a heavily pregnant women differently to an able bodied adult man.  It depends on how she is treated differently.

However, where it certainly goes wrong is where the social consideration extends beyond what is a necessary consequence of different reproductive biology.  The whole edifice of gender roles erected by society to oppress women goes far beyond anything necessary to account for different reproductive biology.  It's that edifice that radfems want to destroy."
5271,Phidwig,"You‚Äôre making perfect sense. No one here can get their head around it either. Trans ideology is nonsensical. But it *sounds* really nice and progressive, which is why so many gender con conforming people start out supporting it and thinking they‚Äôre trans themselves. If you ever start to think about it critically and ask questions, you get shut down. Because it can‚Äôt hold up to scrutiny. The entire concept of gender identity is bullshit, no one should base their identity off of a collection of gender stereotypes that define the gender role they wish to perform. That‚Äôs not an identity. It‚Äôs simply a part of their personality."
5272,purplestreak,"That is exactly the line of thought that made me peak. They can't define ""woman"" without using stereotypes. They claim trans ideology is subversive but it is really just reinforcing the existing conditions but they want to recategorize themselves. 

If it was honestly just ""gender"" and had nothing to do with sex, they wouldn't call themselves transwomen they would call themselves just feminine, feminine men specifically I don't mean ""women and femes"" like some queer theory groups do.  

In theory, TRAs also believe that sex=biology and gender=expectations, the societally constructed aspect. After all, they hold up the pedophile who created ""gender identity."" However, they like to blur the lines with these definitions since they would then have to admit that they are not women, that they are lacking in womanhood in some aspect (all aspects). They wont use femnine for gender and female for sex, they purposefully want to use woman for both. Some insist that they are ""biologically female"" since they claim that biology determined their gender identity. Claiming to feel like a woman doesn't mean anything. They are relying on sterotypes so they refrence things like makeup or princesses. Feeling discomfort in your male body doesn't make you a woman, and neither does feeling giddy imagining being a woman. They both use women as a frame of reference for their understanding while also rejecting the notion that sex has anything to do with it. 

This doesn't necessarily make you a radical feminist but it would make you gender critical and often labeled as a ""TERF"" although honestly just being a woman can cause that."
5273,stunningtoothdecay,"This is exactly why I take issue with the transgender movement. I honestly don't care very much about bathrooms or what individual trans people do, etc. I care about the regression of society after all the work feminists have put into dismantling gender by giving legitimacy to these sexist ideas through legislation, changing language, changing norms, etc.

I'm cool with trans people who have legit dysphoria over their body transitioning and even changing their legal sex as an accommodation for a mental health issue (because society's gender expectations often create the mental health aspects of being trans). But ideally, they should be comfortable performing any gender roles without needing new pronouns or body modification and society as a whole should be moving into that direction. But the trans movement is pushing us in the opposite direction"

The Right only supported her more as a pawn to use against all Muslim immigration without actually considering how she herself is a perfect model of immigration.

Which is a load of crap. The character was described as white at one point in the books (which people online immediately took a picture of and posted, of course) and her own early drawings of the main characters also showed her as white.

I have no issue whatsoever with them casting a black actress for that part, but why does this have to include insulting everyone's intelligence by claiming something that is very clearly wrong? Why not just say that the character was originally imagined as white, but that she wholeheartedly supports this casting choice as well?

5421,DepressedCactus5324,Welcome. Feel free to acknowledge biological reality to your heart's delight.
5422,,"Hi, welcome to the dark side. We have cookies.







 I used to be active on two X a few years ago. It's changed beyond recognition, but appreciate what it was and I learned valuable things there. The lesson I now take from two X that women need female focused or exclusive spaces, and that needs to be affirmed, otherwise males take over and eventually silence or push  women out. 





Reddit did a number on Two X by making it a default sub, which drew a lot of unwanted attention and troll posts. I left around this time and went to snark on troll X for a bit, which seemed to keep the twox spirit for longer but now I see going a similar way, just with more memes. 



There is nothing transphobic about affirming the need for female spaces or that there are biological differences between men and women. That's why we have, to use your example, the basic division of men and women's  sport im the first place. 




Hormones don't change body structure, muscle mass, or male physiology. Even the supposed 'weakening' effect of oestrogen is nuanced as oestrogen strengthens bones too. 





Science is not transphobic.  You're not transphobic. The people who shut down any  questioning of the wisdom of allowing male bodied people in female spaces where biology matters (like toilets, changing rooms, refuges, and sports) are misogynists, plain and simple."
5423,FTThrowAway123,"I was banned long ago for a similar offense.

5428,BB_King4real,"I was just talking about your story to my friend. Glad to find your post here because this boggles my mind that the trans community has become so toxic against any pushback to their agenda that they have begun trying to silence it. I will say that men and women have the freedom to do whatever they wish for themselves, but when it comes to sporting, it has to end there. 

I recently attended a female roller derby event with all-stars from every state. Teams that had trans-women on their roster absolutely crushed the other teams with all biological women. When a trans-woman was able to score, they did. The score differences were in the hundreds. It completely destroyed the integrity of a sport that was supposed to empower women. It‚Äôs a shame that trans-women are so lost in wanting to feel accepted that they are declaring war on biological women and stomping all over the sports that helped bolster their status to where it is now.

But you are apparently not allowed to think as a biological woman, because then you are viciously attacked with the slur TERF. Even if you don't have anything against mtf at all, but think reasonably about the fact that bodies having gone through male puberty are stronger and have an unfair advantages on people with two x chromosomes on the sport field, you just losely will contemptuously call me or anyone else with a different opinion from yourself a terf. It's very agressive to use a slur like that, you know? Women on here are not allowed to think, but others are allowed to hatefully attack women with the term terf? Doesn't seem like a safe space for women anymore here, now does it. And certainly not a sub where free debate is encouraged.

>Well I will call you attackers of thinking biological women a slur too, and it is this: IDIOT HANDMAIDEN (IH) or CONQUERING INVADER OF FEMALE SPACES (CIOFS). Because that's exactly what you are by screeching: terf terf terfs fucking suck terfs must be beaten up etc.

it‚Äôs not a argument that is ‚Äúconclusive‚Äù by any means. science says, that beyond gestation and lactation, there are almost no essential differences between male and female physiology. and that individual differences are due to a gendered world. which would mean ‚Äúfemale‚Äù or ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is mainly constructed.

"
5496,ThisIsNotShakira,"Well, I suppose in any uterine implant into a man - if it were to ever happen as we lost our fucking minds as a society - a pregnancy would not be sustainable and an abortion (and complete removal of uterine implant) would be necessary as a miscarriage could not complete naturally. That is if they realized there had been a miscarriage before life threatening infection set in, because uh, how would they know without any external signs of the miscarriage?

So I suppose at least he is realistic about the outcome of this kind of medical experimentation? Just kidding. He‚Äôs just a selfish and vile lout. 

A friend of mine‚Äôs daughter just lost her pregnancy at 20 weeks and had to go through labour to birth her stillborn baby. It was obviously a painful and traumatic experience. Only a narcisstic asshole would think that getting pregnant - through very expensive means and at great risk to patient and fetus - just to abort sounds like a grand old idea.

Trans activism wants people to believe there is no harm to anyone in allowing a trans person to choose to be what they want, but the reality is that trans as an ideology relies on denial of objective reality and expects everyone around them to labor under an elaborate suspension of disbelief. Nobody is allowed to point out the emperor has no clothes, lest you be labelled a transphobic bigot, but trans people all day long love claiming idiotically that things like referring to abortion or menstration as women's health issues is ""problematic"" or ""transphobic"" (TIMs in particular seem to do this). It actively harms and undermines women and it's done (whether they realize it or not) to secure trans power above that of actual, natal women (and natal men), using their claims of victimhood and oppression as a bludgeon to bully their critics into silence. Trans activists then get to claim how much more superior and enlightened they are, when the reality is quite the opposite, and they tread deeper and deeper into denial about their own identity, lashing out at anything that risks damaging the facade.

5563,RFANA,MRAs scan all the posts to say shitty things to rape survivors too. If you downvote a new post on Reddit it will get buried. They downvote rape survivors on there but there‚Äôs like 3-5 MRAs that stick around to prove their points and say misogynist things and be dismissive. They really need a warning on that sub not to post anything related to being a woman lol
5564,polelifeandpussy,I got removed from there for defending a rape survivor who posted about the whole males being allowed in female shelters and women being booted for raising concerns. Twox is not two x friendly anymore...
5565,malevitch_square,"Some of them are TiMs, so your banning makes sense. Sigh. "

Once everyone started transtrending, the TIMs had to MeToo their way into the subreddit and the official stance was that gender feels are real and that's what makes us women.

They had a sticky for a while because so many trans people would post whiny questions about if they were included 

They tried to start an alternate subreddit called r/femmethoughts that was explicitly for women but without the ""transphobic"" connotations of twox.  I always refused to post there because I think its bullshit that they're literally telling women they think different, pink laydee thoughts.  Not all women are feminine etc etc."
5573,kitsandkats,"TwoX is an older Reddit community. I don't think it's called that for any reason other than ""women have two X chromosomes"" - a statement which is now enough to get you banned from TwoXChromosomes. Funny world we live in!"

Im angry at any man who can see his shoulders and thinks it‚Äôs ok to play in women‚Äôs sports because he wants his gender ID validated. If they care about feminist issues then they must know that thousands of women are killed by their male partners and the men use their hands and shoulders to do it. I was very young when I realized just how much stronger man hands are than mine and how easily they can dominate me. TIMs who think they are women really suck. But there are some who stand with us

5634,RFANA,"Exactly. I mean really, do TIMs not worry about personal liability? They can easily cause very expensive damage to a female opponent.

And of course if you say otherwise, you are committing *literal violence* you *hateful bigot* and how dare you be such a disgusting TERF, and we will all talk about how much we want to punch you but it's totally not hypocritical for breathlessly decrying violence where none exists while fantasizing about violence, because when you're trans you're super and special and awesome, and the only real women are trans women, because cis women are just TERFy menstruators.

5685,Silvershadedragon,Reddit needs to ban those subs as hate subs 
5686,,"You'd think, yeah. But the main ""lesbian"" subs on reddit are for lesbian-*identified* people, not homosexual women. The moderators on the biggest lesbian subs (most of whom are transwomen) ban women for being open about being same-*sex* attracted rather than same-*gender* attracted (the latter of which would be a subtype of *bisexuality*).

Specifically, the sub r/actuallesbians is mainly for lesbian-identified males (and their bisexual female partners, who also call themselves ""lesbians"" despite being capable of sexual attraction to both male and female bodies). The sub r/LesbianActually started off when a group of lesbians broke away from the AL sub, mostly because AL turned into pretty much a replica of one of the other countless trans subs on reddit (top posts are frequently things like ""check out my tracheal shave!"") Additionally, AL had a tendency to militantly ban anyone who is homosexual instead of homogenderal (and open about it). So LA existed as an alternative for actual lesbians- for a short time. But then, to my knowledge, one of the mods on LA started dating a transwoman, and then at least one transwoman became a moderator there themselves. And then recently (like in the past 6-12 months) *that* ""lesbian"" sub started becoming much more trans-oriented, to the point where it had straight up dudes posting dick pics and mods deleting any posts on the sub (and banning gay users too) that talked about not liking dick. So then lesbians (homosexual women) made r/truelesbians, and we are occasionally featured on the ""Against Hate Subs"" subreddit because apparently it is hateful for a woman to categorically exclude all males from her body (and for her to refuse to lie about it-- and I did lie, for years, saying I'd sleep with a transwoman when asked in queer circles order to avoid being called a TERF).

So that's basically where we're at now- truelesbians is the sub for same-sex attracted female people, and it is small but has been growing quickly over the past few months. Oh, and it goes without saying that the sub r/lesbians is lesbian porn for men. "

It's alright for people in a certain in-group be allowed to surround themselves by others in the group for support.

One of my earliest ‚Äúpeak trans‚Äù moments was reading a post by a TiM about how offensive it is to say he is not a biological woman because of...reasons. "
5725,TrollToadette,"Yes yes yes to everything you said.  

Its similar for parents of disabled or severely ill children.  One of my kids had a very severe medical condition.  He wasnt always able to do what other kids were.  We spent months living in a hospital.  That doesnt mean people should tailor discussions about their children around what reality is for my child.  Other moms I know would feel guilty when talking about the routine aggravation in their kids lives (someone is being mean to them at school, etc) and then they would remember the hardships my child was facing.  I'd always tell them to please continue, the world doesnt revolve around me or my kid, whatever is going on in their life is important too.

You sound like a great mom, keep up the good work!"
5726,st_quiteria,"I don't have kids at all. There are probably more of us than of you awesome adoptive parents, and yet I accept that most women have children and that parenting, school stuff, etc. are common topics of conversation online and in person. 

Most of the time I'm interested in the subject when it comes up--I'm an aunt and a taxpayer, these are people I know and I am just generally interested in their experiences--but if it does make my eyes glaze over, I find a way to politely drift away from the conversation. In fact, I feel bad about it when people apologize to me about ""rambling on"" (their words, not mine) about child-related stuff. I absolutely never demand that they make the conversation all about me and my interests.  In fact, that would make me feel extremely uncomfortable.

Oh, yeah, and I would never presume to know more about childrearing than seasoned parents (or new ones, for that matter).

I think what you're describing above is typically  a *male* behavior. (Yes, some women, blah blah, but MOST MEN.) Not being the center of attention in any women's conversation or forum is utterly intolerable to them.  I used to be active in the comments of *Salon's* now-defunct column ""Broadsheet,"" and the first or second comment would always be ""What about the men?"" or ""Not all men!"" or the totally, absurdly irrelevant ""We need to legalize marijuana!"" (always posted by a man--because his subject matter, however unrelated to the topic at hand, should ALWAYS take precedence over whatever trivial things women are talking about, like reproductive rights or equal pay or domestic violence). 

So it wouldn't surprise me at all if being the center of female attention was a primary, if unacknowledged or even unrecognized, factor in a lot of decisions to transition, now that women are bending over backwards to provide it.  In forums like the one I describe, women would at first try to placate and engage with male intruders, and then they'd start to call them out or just ignore them, and eventually such comments would just be considered harassment or trolling and be removed altogether. We need to do this more often and in larger numbers, and when it occurs in real life, we need to smile politely, nod, and bring the conversation back on track. It takes courage, and the initial response will be ugly and unpleasant, but ultimately I think this approach will be effective."
5727,Mountains_beyond,"Kind of off-topic, but could you (or someone else involved in adoption) explain what will happen to your children‚Äôs birth certificates after they are legally adopted? 


I keep hearing about trans people having their birth certificates ammended to reflect their gender identity, and to my knowledge adoptees are the only other group of people who regularly have amended birth certificates (aside from people with errors/typos on their original birth certificate). "
5728,Annelie2,"I have a daughter and from the beginning of my pregnancy to now, she is in elementary school, i have a hard time accepting the mother role. Moms in general are often looked down at and shamed for soo much, people always accuse you of doing something wrong, ... but I can imagine that as an adoptive parent it's even worse because people treat you different. I just wish the mother role, biological or not, would be as honoured in society as it deserves for raising new people and making them into (hopefully) good adults "
5729,,"Thank you for sharing. As an adoptee, it makes my heart soar to hear of happy parents and kids. Adoptive parents are an absolute treasure!

 It doesn't matter who my bio parents are, parents are the people who raise you. There's no replacing that.

It does irk me that my birth certificate has my parents (as opposed to bio parents) name on it, purely because I thought they were meant to be historical as opposed to symbolic/ changeable records. I do understand why adoptive parents might want their names on instead, however. Either way, it hasn't caused any problems for me, I'm just grateful to be with my family!"
5730,applestrudelterf,"I love this. I often think of adoption as a really great analogy for transgenderism.

5739,Sounding_Brass,"Thank you for providing that wonderful analogy from your personal experience. Many of us join (or, are invited in join) existing groups with established identities, customs, and concerns, and, are respectful of them. Not so, transgender activists. Not only do they insist on joining club ""Woman, "" but as soon as they gain entry (whether by invitation, chance, manipulation, harassment, violence, or the law), they start upending established definitions, customs, and concerns to better reinforce their fragile and fictitious female identities. 

And, so, ""Women's"" groups with TIM members may no longer be able to discuss menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, lactation,  and menopause.  And, in some instances, these same groups may not even be able to bring children to their social gatherings...because, as with all things related to female biology, children remind some TIMs of their inadequacy."

Sadly, plenty of biological parents, for a range of reasons that include among others systemic sexism, racism, and classism, are developmentally impaired and their kids end up with lifelong neurological wiring that leaves them profoundly insecure, depressed, and vulnerable to predators. Nothing about ""biological"" parenting that guarantees someone can raise a mentally adaptive, loving, generous human being. Yes, carrying them for nine months, labor, and breast-feeding can be wonderful (and agonizing) bonding experiences, but that doesn't preclude parental narcissism. "

As a side note , I was brought up always knowing I was adopted, definitely the best route not pretending I was anything other than who I was, because of my interest in the subject I have known of other people finding out they are adopted in adulthood or later teenage years and it completely unraveling their understanding of themselves, pulling the rug out from under them so to speak.

How can someone know this (my adoptive mother feels are the same as biological mother feels) anymore than a non-female can know what it feels like to be a biological female? Isn't that what is so worked against here? ""You've never been biologically female, therefore you don't know what it feels like."" You've never been a biological mother, so how can you know you experience the same things? You may love your children with ferocity, but you cannot really say it is ""the same ferocity"" any more than than a trans person can say they have ""the same"" feelings as something they've never been...

5759,,"People are very lonely (in the U.S. but maybe this applies to the greater West), I think, and this leads them to seek to find their place everywhere and in everything because it is not in their homes or even their own bodies at this point. The demographics (longitudinal and well-supported) are not on hand at this moment, but Americans are not having as much sex with each, they don't date each other as much or for as long, they don't marry each other as much, they don't have babies with each other, they don't want babies with each other as much, and they mostly live alone. The majority of Americans rely on technology, otherwise ""the screen.""


Americans are losing their kinship and this seems to push them toward transitory and disparate discursive communities where they can place their identities and affiliation. Actually, Americans brand themselves with goofy monikers in order to be apart of various identities and affiliations because that's how desperate they are to expend affection. Unfortunately, kinship communities--those born of sharing homesteads, rituals, neighborhoods, food, stories, geographic spaces, histories, families (this includes adopters and adoptees), and even common language (think of all the new neologisms becoming legal writ that bring us to this forum)--are intrinsically bound in ways that the State and technology cannot unravel, sublimate or substitute. Americans spend the vast majority of their time staring at screens (me too!). I hate to say it, but humans are animals and they kinda function best when they interface with each other face-to-face, live in collectives stably, and are allowed to freely associate with each other as autonomous bodies. Actually this is the only function the State and technology ought to be focused on. Instead, the Internet has killed American sociality, and with that, our means of kinship, and therefore stable identity and belonging. Best example of this is the scourge of online dating, and social media is another potent example.


Kinship sociality almost kinda seems to be dying in the U.S. only to be replaced with consumerist/brand-driven discursive communities. Discursive communities require no bodies though, you would just need to speak the magic words to be granted entry. And as long as your magic words don't compromise the discursive communities ""community guidelines"", you're in. If you don't use that communities approved language, you'd like be ejected at a moment's notice, much unlike how kinship sociality works.


I haven't been to the U.S. in a while, but the reports of people in my cohort who I try to keep in touch with are weird to say the least. Everyon'e lonely. No one married. No one's having kids. They all work too much to do anything. And they're stressed out.

Sometimes listening to them chat, or even just seeing them walking around being so visibly pregnant, is upsetting to me.

""Louis is suggesting that all sex workers are damaged and women can't have unemotional detached sex. We can and we do. Would have been better if he'd balanced it out with sex workers who didn't have sad pasts.""

It also turns out that the woman with autism in the documentary has a carer who wrote a letter complaining to the BBC about the documentary, and she's tweeted it. Apparently she is upset it doesn't show sex work in a positive light!  The carer is also upset because she is a sex worker and they didn't include her story in the show (I suspect this is the real reason for the angry letter.) This carer lady thought she would be in the documentary as well, (but she didn't have a contract) and apparently now she's worried she is ugly and has a 'lack of charisma'.There's clearly some issues here.

The carer is angry that the woman's friends were asked questions about what they thought about her job. I thought prostitution was a-ok? Why would it be inappropriate to ask her friends questions about her escorting, especially when the entire point of the documentary was about sex work? 

Apparently talking about the women's bad pasts was an 'outdated stereotype and furthered that narrative that something bad has happened to sex workers. I don't know what to make of this. Maybe it's a stereotype for a reason? If I'm going to be convinced that sex work is great, I don't really need to see a woman sobbing because she was abused as a child.

Finally, the carer complains she she was outed as a sex worker without her consent, despite...agreeing to be in the show and agreeing to put that information in.

We would constantly question if what we were doing was really okay and worth the money. I remember talking to my TiM friends about my concerns, thinking they could relate as another marginalized group, and they would try to convince me that this was all actually very empowering and that just because I had my doubts about it didn‚Äôt mean all sex workers hated what they do or were damaged.

6081,izumokuni,"Although I think it is totally true and an important thing to be mindful of in conversations about sex work - that many women involved are traumatized women with low self-esteem - I think that many women become defensive in the face of this accusation and dont want to hear us out because it is also true that many women are not traumatized and simply do it for the money. 

This was my perspective when I was involved in ""sex work"" - that I saw an opportunity to make easy money so I took it. I never once deluded myself into thinking I was doing anything empowering or positive for women, but the way I saw it was that Im going to be exploited either way in society as a woman, so I may as well try to make as much money as possible in the process. I would never do the work though if it wasn't true that it pays so much..

As a qualifier, having lived in Amsterdam, and worked in Harm Reduction with prostitutes I think prostitution and all consensual adult sex work should be legal. But I discouraged her because I consider it a bad self-destructive impulse and I mean why the f did you get a masters degree then? 

Use your brain and protect your spirit! She told me I was 'sex shaming' and a square, a prude and that it was 'empowering'. I have never bought that line of BS and meeting many prostitutes in my prior job never changed that. The way they frame it as 'sex positive' makes it a challenge to make them understand that it's more 'sex positive' to have sex in appropriate circumstances with someone who might actually give two shits about you."

I said at the start of the program ""I bet these women have really sad backgrounds and lead very tough lives."" She scoffed and said ""not all women in sex work are damaged! Some of them love the work!"" By the end of the show she was pretty glum about the huge amount of exploitation and trauma. I was too to be honest - I didn't expect it to be that bad. 

I think here's something that lib fems don't quite get. For them, prostitution is always done by some mythical other woman who 'loves sex' and 'loves to feel empowered'. Who are these women? My friend wouldn't be a prostitute - she was repulsed at the idea. She wouldn't like her kids to be prostitutes. She wouldn't like it if her friends became prostitutes. So who are these magical women who love having sex with five strange men a day? They don't exist.

It wouldn't surprise me if he had TRIED to find a prostitute who wasn't raped/abused at some point but just couldn't. Even many of the ""Happy Hookers"" and ""Happy Porn Stars"" out there who publicly defend sex work admit to being abused or raped at some point in their lives.

> It also turns out that the woman with autism in the documentary has a  carer who wrote a letter complaining to the BBC about the documentary,  and she's tweeted it. Apparently she is upset it doesn't show sex work  in a positive light!  The carer is also upset because she is a sex  worker and they didn't include her story in the show (I suspect this is  the real reason for the angry letter.)  

This is VERY concerning! It makes me wonder if the carer coerced and/or groomed the autistic girl in her care into sex work. I didn't see the documentary yet, so I don't know how much mental functioning the girl has. But the fact that she relies on a carer makes me think that she might not have the mental capacity to understand what sex work entails and to properly consent to it.

&#x200B;

At the very least, I hope this documentary and that unhinged letter leads to that poor girl getting a new carer (and the old one getting blacklisted from caring for any other vulnerable person)"
6097,RoundTwoElectric,"After reading it I feel really uncomfortable. Carers are meant to be helpful, friendly sure. But to become best friends with someone in a situation where there is clearly a power dynamic and a reliance of the one girl on the other, and then the carer ‚Äúintroduces her‚Äù to escorting... 

And then the girl says she was fine with the edit until her carer told her otherwise. Oof."
6098,GnomesHateCheese,">...furthered that narrative that something bad has happened to sex workers.

I hate this line of attack. It's so dishonest. It assumes the ""narrative"" to be false as a foregone conclusion without actually presenting any arguments as to why it's false. You could say that about absolutely anything, the phrase is so devoid of meaning.

As in ""...furthered the narrative that seat belts save lives"" or ""...furthered the narrative that the moon is not made of cheese"", or ""...furthered the narrative that dogs make great pets"". 

So it ""furthers the narrative"". I don't give a damn if someone thinks it furthers a narrative. Is the claim correct or not? If there are arguments against the claim, then trot them out. Just whinging about a ""narrative"" being ""furthered"" is meaningless."

She is dismayed that she has not managed to present sex work as empowering and fantastic, and that she‚Äôs given a stereotypical view.

I understand she wants to present a narrative that she's empowered, and it's all fantastic, but people have eyes and can read between the lines. She is (according to her) a very disabled woman who needs full time care. She cannot live independently. She was horribly abused as a child and seems to be working through her trauma through sex. She is still actively upset by it. I mean, it's not great right? It's sad. There's a real worry that men are further abusing and exploiting someone who appears to be quite vulnerable."

There's a subset of sex workers in my city who are ""empowered"" women making a ""choice"" and they are mostly young and living a seemingly jetset lifestyle. They do it to fund this lifestyle of travel, designer goods and basically and ironically, to live the good life.

But it's damaging. And not worth it. And they don't actually NEED all that money, they just think they do to live this capitalist, materialist life ideal that's been foisted on us all by the powers that be.

i have another former friend who is mid 30's and is now doing sex work. she is extremely fit and works as a dominatrix, but also has sex with her clients. before she got into this work, she was working retail and struggling month to month. we live in an extremely expensive and materialistic city where everyone is flashing their cars and clothes and fancy holidays. her instagram is also full of the same stuff now.

my point is these were pretty normal women who i doubt would feel the need to make ""so much money"" if we didn't live in such a fucked up society that shovels materialism down our throats every which way we turn. my friend in particular, if she lived somewhere that you could get by on a normal wage and didn't have people all around her living these extreme lifestyles with cars and clothes out of reach to anyone on a normal wage, i doubt she'd decide to sell herself to ""achieve"" that level of ""success"" and the so-called ""good life""...

I'm not sure how you've managed to measure your libido against most men, but you can find a mountain of peer reviewed studies that demonstrate a crystal clear and very large disparity in libido on average. The difference depends on the metric, but it is there. And not individual by individual, but as a group (hence plural men).

Any disparity at all will drive supply and demand. That's not empowerment.

>What‚Äôs not normal is their lack of empathy and ethics.

This one is a strange point to make as it contradicts what 'normal' means (since the assertion is about half the population) and is widely seen among many other polygamous social/herding species (of which humans are one, or were in the not too distant past). I think many sociologists, biologists, and anthropologists have suggested that, as far as evolution is concerned, that it makes sense to be that way. But I digress.

I totally agree that sex for women is an emotional and empathetic gesture and for men it is not.

>And ‚Äúthere are some that cross over into a relationship‚Äù what the fuck are you talking about? Pretty Woman is not a documentary.

I'm talking beyond Pretty Woman and addressing the alternative view - that sex work should be respectable, empowering, or about more than the men's perspective of what sex is about. I acknowledge that some women in the industry play roles more than the asserted 'masturbatory aid', but that this is extremely rare.

They may have appeared normal to you, a relative outsider. But I guarantee you that, if they have a close loving family, those people would tell you that these women had struggled with learning, working, emotional regulation, eating disorders and/or drugs for years. 

Women who have ""other options,"" don't become or stay sex workers just because they like material things. The material things may be something they're attached to, but always as a distraction for some underlying problem. 

One of my (redacted) has been a sugar baby, yacht girl and ""high end"" escort. She's definitely not living on the streets. And when she was younger she definitely had a very Instagramable life. Her friends think she's the life of the party.

But her parents would tell you that she has faced a lifelong struggle with eating and personality disorders. That she's tried and failed to pursue degrees or hold down a normal job. That she was devastated every time she lost a normal job. (ETA: Even the service industry jobs that she might have told her friends didn't pay enough.) That she's deeply ashamed of those losses, to the point that she can't even reflect on them. 

I guarantee you, your friends would not just be living a ""normal lifestyle"" if they weren't surrounded by materialism. The materialism is just the filter for the way they express whatever overarching issues have affected them since childhood. Which you don't know about because they're experts at dissimulating. 

There are scores and scores of girls who are affected by mental health and developmental issues that get passed through the educational system because they are people pleasers and because, in some affluent schools, you just don't fail anyone. Some of them even manage to make it through college by choosing a ""filler major"" and just retaking hard classes till they get a negligent professor. 

But eventually their inability to perform difficult cognitive tasks on a daily basis, consistently, catches up to them. These are the women who become lifelong sex workers even though they come from an affluent background. 

Sex work takes advantage of the impoverished, for sure. But it also takes advantage of women who are troubled with psychiatric and developmental issues."

OK, I am not making multiple 6 figures, but I have a good salary, beautiful place to live and I have no problem at all paying for my lifestyle out of that. I think our mutual friend thought it would appeal to me not to go to work? Getting gifts from rich men like the stories she was telling me about? Idk. But its not for me.

We all fell out after that, I think because our mutual friend revealed herself as a sex worker to me. Its really odd because her family is quite wealthy, thats where I thought her money and lifestyle was coming from. When she was trying to recruit me she told me her mother said ""other women do it for free on a friday night, at least you're getting paid!""... her mother is fucking nutcase. Very wealthy family. Truly bizarre."

6220,socess,"> I mean, she has a Crossfitter type body with breast implants, so I'm not sure why she never went down the path of personal trainer, she has a bubbly personality and is great with people. 

I was going to say maybe it had to do with the cost barrier to entry for personal training. It requires certification and that usually costs around $600 in the U.S. But if they're wealthy, it's probably more to do with the pay. New personal trainers working at a gym make minimum wage or a little over. The pay is not a driver to join the fitness industry."
6221,Thatstealthygal,Someone I met once told me she'd had domination suggested to her as an alternative to having to have sex with clients but she wasn't keen because she'd heard it can bleed into your private life. Which I thought was interesting.

6224,OrneryStruggle,Source lmao?
6225,anchovycupcakes,"I'm not really sure. I was a personal trainer for many years, so I know what it takes to become one. Even at the bottom, it's better pay than grinding out casual retail and she really looks the part and has an outgoing personality, people would flock to her for training and she could charge top dollar because of her background in competitive strength sports and her look. Unless they've changed things in the 15 years since I got my first cert, you can get an ultra basic weekend certification and work in a gym, it's not that expensive. I think at 24 Hour Fitness, you could even come in with no certs and just do their proprietary 3 day ""certification"" and take on clients if you could get them. I also worked at Equinox and Equinox will educate you themselves. 

I mean, at the end of the day, she didn't do that. She made her choices. I shared her story because I really feel that she's someone I personally know who is a victim of materialism and our grotesque capitalist society. I wonder if she happy with her choices. She hasn't chosen this career path for survival. She's done it to live a luxury lifestyle. And I think, at least in my city, that's the motivation for a lot of women choosing sex work."
6226,Ex_Machina_1,"Then how do you explain ""clinical evidence that exogenous testosterone improves the most commonly reported sexual problems in women. These include measures of sexual desire and arousal, pleasure and overall satisfaction."" (Sharon Parish, MD).

Might you give me so more information about what I'm missing here? Would like to learn."
6227,djgringa,"It's common knowledge that it cuts down on physical assault, transmission of disease, unwanted pregnancy and human trafficking. Why don't you provide a source that disputes that?"
6228,socess,">Unless they've changed things in the 15 years since I got my first cert, you can get an ultra basic weekend certification and work in a gym, it's not that expensive.

They've changed things. It might also vary by area. Where I'm at, any decent gym is going to require you are already certified by ACE, NASM, or similar, before they hire you. Those programs are several hundred dollars. And, like I said, the starting pay isn't much above minimum wage. $14 or $15 an hour.

Personal trainers *can* make more, for sure. But that would be an established trainer with a solid client base who's working for themselves and not a gym. At the start, it does not pay much. It's a line of work you join out of passion, not a need for money."
6229,Quixoticfutz,"As I said ""not the main hormone"" which doesn't mean it has no effect, much like testosterone seems to be the main hormone affecting sexual drive in men and yet estrogen, progesterone, and the relation between them still has an effect on male sex drive.


Here are some of the symptoms men go through with low estradiol:


Fatigue along the lines of sleepiness

Hypersomnia (sleeping too much and too often)

Strong erections but limited sensitivity

 **Loss of erections**

Osteoporosis and osteopenia

Joint pain, clicking or popping joints

Eye fatigue (eyes seem more tired despite adequate sleep, dark circles)

 **Loss of libido**

Anxiety, depression, irritability


Yup, turns out a lot of things we thought were just from low T in males are actually also from low E.

And from wikipedia about the impact of T on females:

>""Research suggests **androgens such as testosterone, are not sufficient by themselves to prompt sexual motivation in females.** In particular, studies with rhesus macaques have observed testosterone was not significantly associated with variations in level of sexual motivation in females.¬†However, some research with nonhuman primates suggests a role for androgens in female sexual reproduction behaviour. Adrenalectomized female rhesus monkeys displayed diminished female sexual receptivity. Later studies revealed this diminished sexual receptivity was specific to the elimination of androgens that **can be converted to estrogen.**"""

&#x200B;

It's a clear, bullshit double standard. A man can compete with women despite a clear, objective advantage. But a biological woman gets disqualified for using a lip balm with an ounce on steroid in it despite the fact that a doctor deemed it medically necessary for her and there was no way she was getting a competitive edge from it.

It could be a lot of womens' last chance to compete in their careers; that'd be hard to give up.

What they need to do is organize and become vocal before that drastic a step is necessary. If they threaten to boycott well in advance then they might nip the issue in the bud. Unfortunately even finely-tuned athletic women are permeated with socialized niceness and compassion so many are willing to be martyrs if they think it means making a positive change in the world."
6260,ArtisanFeminist,"I agree, but I think so many people are afraid to speak out because of the labelling, abuse and threats that will surely follow.   
And it must be very difficult for female athletes to even discuss these issues together and decide on a strategy to speak out against or combat the unfairness as we have seen how difficult it is for women to find any 'space' to come together and even discuss the effects these issues- even wanting to have a dialogue is labelled as transphobic, and the consequences of that can be devastating."

6282,GnomesHateCheese,"If you could somehow measure strength or performance instead of size, and then lump competitors in groups based on that, then yes, you could have a class where men and women of equal strength compete together. But accurately measuring a person's strength is difficult. And in a way we already have a system where people compete against people of the same capacity, it's called qualifiers and lower tier competitions. If you removed sex segregation and just had performance-based classes, you would have women populating the lower performance classes and men nearly exclusively controlling the higher performance classes. And I'm willing to bet good money that in the absolute top tier you would see no women at all. 

Problem is, men have a much greater potential for strength and performance when training is applied. Look at records in almost all sports for men and women and you will find that women's records lag behind considerably. If you take running competitions for men and women and slap them together, you won't get a bunch of men and women running together for similar placements, with somewhat stronger representation of men in the top 10% than women. You will get a bunch of men running, then a small group of slow men and very fast women running together IF you're lucky, and at the tail there will be the great majority of women runners. Now, personally I understand why the women runners aren't interested in being put in that position."
6283,GnomesHateCheese,"If sex classes are erased from sports, there won't be ""less women"" at high levels. There will be almost no women at high levels. Sport will effectively cease to be an option for women, except as a recreational thing. The difference in male and female performance is more than significant across the board, especially at high levels. Sexes aren't separated in sport ""somehow"", they are separated for very specific reasons relating to performance. It's not about being inspired, it's about physiological differences. 

This is of course even without considering the issue of contact sports, where women would risk serious injury if they were expected to play with men. 

There are a handful of sports where women can compete on an equal level with men, e.g. shooting and show jumping. But those sports are the exception, because they are sports where the physical strength or size of the competitor is much less important than in normal sports."

Bullying you would have been a challenge but Juniper is easy to manipulate because of the kids. Domestic violence is often hidden because the impact of public acknowledgement on the children would be highly negative, but sometimes it is only by bringing things into the cold light of day that things cool down. It is always a risk to take private issues public but since it is already in the public domain, thanks to your excellent piece on Stroud, there is no point in not letting the world know that his abuse is ongoing.

We've been together for four and a half years and married for almost four. We have a very stable and healthy marriage and I've been co-parenting the son that Meredith refuses to care for since just after he turned one. We've been in court one way or another because of Meredith for several years now to the tune of about $30,000 out of pocket. Since the time that affidavit was written, the past due support has passed the $20k mark. Meredith has used any imaginable trick to avoid this obligation including repeatedly moving, having their roommate cash checks and send money through PayPal, and so on. In court they went so far as to throw a tantrum at the thought of having to pay for medical expenses because they didn't approve of Juniper marrying me and taking our son off of welfare. They're that horrible of a person. 

I know that being a TiM myself I'm not the most likable person here, but I hope that at least in this situation you can understand that I'm a person with a good heart who wants nothing but the best for Juniper and our family. I have a lot of issues with the trans community to the point where I tend to keep myself distanced and am called a transphobe or TERF when I do speak. It's an odd place to be in.

6312,twoXfeminist,"Thank you for your bravery as a GC feminist journalist. Many women who aren‚Äôt doing freelance work around these issues are forced to stay silent in order to keep their jobs. Unfortunately I‚Äôm one of them, which is why I have to thank you. Women like yourself who speak up about Yaniv and Stroud are absolutely pivotal to progressing women‚Äôs rights. Keep it up and don‚Äôt be afraid to continue posting here for support."
6313,Bananastic,"I feel this is the elephant in the room but do we know anything about the other man saying he is a woman she is dating now? Because fragile women in precarious situations are often the targets of multiple abusers and end up in the same pattern of relationships several times. Do we know if he is decent?

Can't he help her with her financial trouble? Do we know if he will not take the money we all are sending to her go fund me?

Abusive men and trans identified abusive men very often say they are the victimest victims and he could probably say he needs the money more for his hormones or whatever. We know she is still very impressionable and manipulable as she still says that the first MTT raping her beating her and almost killing her was worth it if his book helped some trans identified man or whatever.

It is a well known fact that victims of domestic abuse often go through several abusive relationships. It would be great if we knew she isn't the victim of an abusive narcissistic TIM again.

6316,PollyannaPenny,"It's fucking insane that any abusive man can erase his past (and current) crimes simply by saying, *""I'm a trans-woman!""*. The TRAs and the handmaidens seem to believe that a person is magically reborn when they claim to be trans and therefore deserve to be absolved of any and all past transgressions. And if their victims continue to seek justice, THEY'RE the problem and they need to be silenced.

&#x200B;

It's no wonder that so many gross, misogynist straight men with a history of abusing others are suddenly ""discovering their inner woman"". It's basically a real life Get Out Of Jail Free Card! And it's super easy now that being trans no longer requires any sort of serious medical or psychological gate-keeping."
6317,ex-jewish-princess,Disgusting no one in the trans community has condemned this
6318,LikeTheTree8,"Hi,

I‚Äôve agreed not to speak publicly about my ex so this comment is 100% about myself and I won‚Äôt be adding much to the discussion, but I wanted to say:

I appreciate the outpouring of support, more than I can possibly say. This has been very scary for me and I am so thankful to Anna for helping me feel less alone and less helpless dealing with all of it. I honestly didn‚Äôt expect any of this and it‚Äôs been a huge emotional whirlwind.

The update I added to the GoFundMe where I described my relationship with radical feminism as ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù wasn‚Äôt intended to be a condemnation fo radical feminism, but the opposite. I‚Äôm in a weird position in that I struggle with gender dysphoria but I hold a lot of beliefs in common with gender-critical feminists. I was intending to express that, although I know that a lot of radfems are very untrusting of people like me, I‚Äôm never offended by anyone‚Äôs support or compassion, and I‚Äôd absolutely never dox or betray someone who helped me. 

I hope my attempt to express gratitude and acknowledgement of the source of the donations didn‚Äôt end up alienating or offending anyone. I‚Äôm thankful for the help. And I need it now. Not just financially, but emotionally, mentally‚Äî I feel like I‚Äôve taken a huge, dangerous leap and have to trust that there are people who will catch me. Seeing a lot of people coming together for me has been awe-inspiring and has helped me keep some hope that things will be ok. 

I did see some comments from people concerned about my marriage to Tristen now. I understand that from the outside, without knowing either of us, it could definitely look like some kind of trauma-induced leap from one toxic relationship into another, but that‚Äôs really not the case here. 

I won‚Äôt say that being trans has nothing to do with me and Tris‚Äôs relationship, because it does. One of the things that initially bonded us to each other was that we both felt very alone within the trans/dysphoric community because we felt that our experiences and beliefs were very different from the typical narrative, and we were both very frustrated with what we both saw as an epidemic of abusive behavior within the community being written off as acceptable. We actually have a very happy and healthy relationship and she is wonderful to me and has been instrumental in helping me survive and heal. 

There was one comment from someone who said she wouldn‚Äôt have donated if she knew I was married to a TiM now. Can that person please contact me? I‚Äôll Paypal you back the amount you donated. 

Again, thank you all.

Please don‚Äôt interpret my silence in this thread as apathy or ingratitude‚Äî I‚Äôm just trying to keep myself safe.

6326,Liz-B-Anne,"Saw this story pop up on my FB timeline today.  How sick & disturbing the way the rapist/abuser tries to blame mental illness & make himself look like the victim...not to mention utterly predictable.  It's what men do.

I have nothing to offer but this:  More people are peaking every day.  You are not alone; I see it happening in all walks of life... people getting fed up to their ears with this insanity.  The recent Southpark episode, the Dave Chappelle piece, daily 'top comments' mocking supposedly serious pro-trans videos & articles on VICE & similar news outlets... These are mainstream publications & outlets so they're a pretty accurate representation of the public at large.  Black women on Lipstick Alley are not here for the trans shit.  Many tampon-buying women are not having the erasure of women by Always.  And on & on.  

So please understand that your work is not in vain.  It may take a while but every drop fills the bucket that much further.  I hope everyone does their part to share the story far & wide so more people see it.  I sure will because it was one of the more disturbing things I'd seen in a long time.  Thank you for giving a victim a voice."
6327,julia-on-reddit,"So, they got married in June 2013, the wife got pregnant and a few months later her husband decided to become ""her true self"". And he's an abuser, how... common. I've got this impression that the wife believed that the transition was a cure to his mental illness resulting in abuse so she just had to be patient. Until she couldn't anymore.

Then she married another transwoman (guilt?) but is still a terf.

Women who get their self esteem by being the goodest good girl doormats need to throw non-doormat women under the bus as bad girls.

I don't think being a nice/kind natured woman is ""toxic"" per se. Women are generally nice and tolerant towards everyone including abusers and the male horde which is one of the reasons why women/females are the superior gender. Kindness is NOT a weakness, it is a strength and one that men in general, especially trans men seem to lack. Anger and hatred, which are typical male traits, are easy and regressive.

Which society would be a superior one?  
  
A society made entirely of NICE women or a society made entirely of ANGRY men?

That being said, not all women have to be nice all the time. It is ok for women to get angry and get even and I hope she secures enough money or a pro bono lawyer to legally kick this dudes ass back into poverty and obscurity where he belongs."

I'm honestly not sure how to answer all of this.

I'll answer as best I can in my own words. 

I transitioned because after growing up sheltered with very uneducated grandparents, I finally stumbled onto something that was the 'aha!' moment for feelings I'd struggled with for a lot of my life. I experienced the cliche feeling of peace as my body started to match what it felt like in my mind, etc etc. 

As for who I am and how I feel, I just am. That's it. I wasn't born biologically female and I didn't grow up with those experiences, I can't claim them. I only know of what I experience myself firsthand and what I learn by shutting up and listening. I've always felt like I'm a guest in this house and that my place is to act like one. I'm not owed a key to the front door. 

As far as impact goes, being trans has definitely impacted parts of my life. There's no way that it couldn't. As for personality, I'll make self-deprecating jokes but that's it. I'm trans but it's just a part of who I am and not a defining factor. I dont feel a need or desire to bring it up in conversation if I can help it."

Just keep in mind that we're dealing with someone who has used the legal system to torture our family for years, so if it ever seems like we are ever being too kind or too civil about some aspect of this, consider that as a likely reason why.

We have to face the facts that we don't live in a society that is made of nice women. We live in a society full of all kinds of abusers and I have not found that appeasement and doormatness is the most effective way to neutralize them.

To me, it doesn't make sense to argue in generalized way whether kindness is a weakness or not. My concerns are practical, my question is what will be effective in a given situation. As we've seen, appeasement to TiMs in the name of kindness has gotten us into a shitshow

Moreover, to me there is a big distinction between superficial kindness, and big picture kindness. You can be nice in the moment and reap the nicey-nice points and ultimately fail in your goal and get everyone into a really f***** up situation. Or you can be not so nice and make things better on a large scale. I prefer the latter and don't mind being the bad guy."

6513,AnnaSlatz,"She does not and please trust that there is a reason for that. She communicates freely with me, her lawyers, her friends, her partners. But she has refrained from making too many public statements for legal reasons. 

This GFM that people are donating to was actually established in June or July, wayyyyy before her and I connected (which was only last week). She had tried to solicit some help on her own to raise money for her legal battle against Meredith's extreme arrears in child support (hence the name of the GFM, and the sworn affidavit in the GFM photo). 

When I came here today, it was after being so sad and distraught because Juniper was being threatened with defamation suits by Meredith for coming forward with her stories of abuse at Meredith's hands. These legal threats caused her to incur even more legal costs, which led to the awful situation I outlined in my original post. And then all of you lovely people came through with donations to that GFM that had been established long ago. 

But getting back to the original point: THATS why she doesn't often talk. It is because there is an undercurrent legal battle she is in. Not just this new one that has just cropped up, but the original one. 

IN MY OPINION (THIS IS MY OPINION NOT JUNIPER'S, I AM ONLY SPEAKING FOR MYSELF) her current lawyer (the one who is dealing with the child support case) does not seem that competent. I wish she had better legal counsel so she did not feel so scared to speak out and exercise her rights. I hope a feminist lawyer sees this and takes her case on. Wishful thinking, but I can pray."

He was very openly gay so it can't be excused by him needing to stay in the closet. He stayed married so someone would take care of him.

It is another issue for me of the art versus the artist. Same thing with Lovecraft. The man was the definition of racist but his stories were actually genius. Or Bill Cosby--without the Cosby Show being such a smash hit you wouldn't have had Fresh Prince, In Living Color, Martin, etc.

6569,Sarahthegreen,"The first thing I think of wrt genius then and now isn't sexism, it's forcing kids to learn at the same pace as other kids their age regardless of how gifted they are. I realize that this interacts strongly with sex, BUT at the same time, I think a lot of female genius today is being lost to the factory assembly-line model of schooling, because by the time you actually get a chance to stretch your mind, it's fossilized. Genius requires being allowed to learn in a state of flow, which was more possible in the past than today. It was easier to learn multiple languages/be a polymath back then because you weren't expected to wait for the rest of the class to catch up, and in the meantime maybe help someone else with stuff you find excruciatingly boring.

From what I've seen, exceptionally gifted people seem to either soar or tank, depending on whether or not the environment is supportive or not. Sex is only one component of that (though it is a significant one). Conformity is another. I don't know if gifted programs help or not. They tend to get watered down. I was only allowed to accelerate a bit, and it didn't really help with either the frustration or the isolation.

The other thing, of course, is that women of genius in the past have often not been seen as geniuses because they were interested in girl stuff, e.g. Maria Montessori.

I used to rant about this issue a lot in gifted organizations."

6574,kt0998,"It was easy to be a master of history, medicine, physics, engineering, etc when all those fields were in their early stages. Today, genius is measured by deep engagement with a specific field, because r skills, not by todays standards.  Sciences were primitive, simply being literate (unlike most population) wealthy male with enough free time to read four important books on a subject made one an expert. I am not exaggerating. The entire knowledge of medicine in renaissance europe for example fit into few books and it was mostly pseudosicientific nonsense. They knew nothing about cells, microbes, hormones, how brain works etc. 

Any ordinary person today knows more about almost any subject that da Vinci knew in his time. He would've known virtually nothing about world outside Europe, nothing about basic physics like gravity (Newton was two centuries later), nothing about microscopic matter/life etc. He tried to study how the heart pumps blood because it was a mystery back then. This isn't shitting on da Vinci (he was certainly a genius artist) but his inventions have been overrated and the same goes  for all these Renaissance men. People write shit like how he invented a helicopter, because he had imaginary model that resembled it, but this is like saying that George Lucas invented a space station that can blow up planets because he came up with the Death Star. It's just fantasy. 

It was easy to be a master of history, medicine, physics, engineering, etc when all those fields were in their early stages. Today, the amount of information available is infinitely greater and so the measure of genius is now how deep a person's knowledge of a single field is, because nobody can master any field perfectly in their lifetime."

Usually, these dudes love to brag about being science savvy, but can't detect basic confirmation bias. Sciene, journalism, everything that tries to make factual statements needs to be cross-checked by people who hold different world views and have complementary expertise.

Haha.  And maybe the ‚Äúgenius‚Äù factor has something to do with my strong preference for the Gothic Art period to the Renaissance. At least many of the known Gothics were not served by women, or other races, but by ""brothers"" in the monasteries, or religious houses.

Plus she didn't actually have full control of her own money - her brother was involved - but at his urging she limited how much she'd give Oscar because she knew Oscar was completely useless with money and he'd end up spending all their sons' inheritance on champagne and cigarette boxes for his friends. Oscar of course veered between understanding completely and raging about how unfair it was.

I do think he loved his wife but he was also horribly cruel to her once the sheen had worn off and he started sleeping with men. His biographers generally seem to agree that he didn't twig to his sexual orientation until after marriage - before that he was actually known as a bit of a prude, didn't like coarse talk, the complete opposite of his older brother who couldn't keep out of brothels - and while she had way more money than him, this was discussed with her father before the marriage and he worked hard to reduce his debts before they wed.

6606,InactiveDegenerate,"Labour is a tricky subject, historically speaking. What did the book class as labour? For much of recorded history working men were required to complete military service and the training that went with it which would naturally remove them from working a job or in the home. During the Hellenistic period, for example, the standing armies of various kings and princes would number tens of thousands and they'd be 'on duty' for years at a time, constantly being refreshed and replenished as they died in pointless sieges and prolonged marches. 

 I'm glad that women's history is getting more attention in modern academia. In fact, in my uni almost all of the women I've spoken to are studying topics relating to women and gender roles in the ancient world. If anything I'm starting to feel pigeon-holed by it, since women overwhelmingly choose female-centred spheres of study while men still dominate in other topics (like warfare, economy etc.) I take a class in ancient aesthetics and most of the women on my course are doing it as a supplement to a project on womens' issues, while the (very few) men are discussing it in a more general, less gender-centric sense."

6611,StupidHappyPancakes,"I was just saying today how strange I found it that after being mercilessly bullied my whole childhood and teens for being so different, all of a sudden, in my very first semester in college I noticed that I was getting constant, effusive compliments about my personal style or my comments in class.  Literally *everything* that used to make me different in such a *bad* way when I was young was suddenly coded the exact *opposite* way as an adult!  All of a sudden, society wants to reward confidence, innovation, a critical mind, outspokenness, and individualism--*after* more than a decade of the school system beating all that out of you.

I also wish there was more support for gifted children and teens because there is a really peculair presupposition in education that smart kids *must* come from a good family.  Teachers and administrators tend to assume parents are nurturing the gifts of their exceptional child, and yeah, the smarter kids on average seemed to have much better home lives and financial support, but then there was *me* getting the highest test scores in the entire *school* but having to raise my sister while living with a drunken neglectful mother and her sex abuser felon boyfriend.  

Teachers tended to think I was lazy or lacked motivation when it came to things like extracurriculars, entering competitions, and planning for college applications with their parents, but my reality wasn't one that even remotely made me think there was a future for me.  I was too intellectual to hang out with many of the kids who had families as bad as my own, but then I was too trashy for the smart kids.  

I can't even *imagine* how much worse this situation would be if someone belonged to a minority group that was viewed negatively IN ADDITION TO what I went through.  Education needs to beware that it isn't conflating ""intelligent"" with some twisted notion of ""respectable.""  It's not enough to merely *identify* gifted students if they have zero support at home, and teachers shouldn't assume that just because parents were capable of producing a smart child, it means those parents necessarily give a crap about that child.

I eventually went to an Ivy League grad school on full scholarship after dropping out of high school and taking a winding path through my bachelor's.  I was so excited to meet people who were WAY smarter than me!  However, I was saddened to find that many of these students weren't particularly bright and usually didn't do there homework either, but they all shared *almost identical* socioeconomic histories! They all had parents who had literally been prepping them to be the very best and brightest since *birth* in spite of their *actual* strengths and weaknesses.

That's not true, most of the renaissance ""geniuses"" were simply highly skilled artisans who were sent as kids to learn a skill in a shop and made a living by selling their artworks. 

Patriarchy is the reason young boys were sent to do artisan labour while women where sold in to marriage or locked in a convent, and classism is what made it possible for the clergy, bankers and landowners to commission expensive artworks, but let's not pretend that artists in the XV century were evil oppressors.

In England, for example, double monasteries were a thing in the 7-8th centuries, most famously a place called Whitby abbey which had separate female and male institutions but were together, as well as barking abbey. Here the female institutions have cool archaeological remains suggesting writing (styluses have been found at Whitby abbey) and the role of female scribes has been very overlooked. However both monasteries and convents almost disappeared in the next few centuries as indivual institutions let alone double monasteries (in the late 8th century one of the councils of nicaea banned double monasteries but by then even single monasteries or convents had declined or often disappeared in much of England).  the revival of monasteries in the 10th century in England involved separate monasteries and convents/nunneries, to the point that men weren‚Äôt even allowed to enter convents. I only studied this period but wikipedia suggests there may have been a revival in the 12th century in England, and that double monasteries existed in the early Christian Byzantine empire."

Renaissance men of noble status spoke multiple languages because it was common expectation at the time. Save for Americans, most people around the world still are bi or trilingual. Ultimately, I don‚Äôt get what the gotcha moment is for the fact that women did housework for famous smart men. If we were talking about how talented women were ignored, I would find that a useful discussion. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate to post something of a feminist meme here.

6675,InactiveDegenerate,"Yeah, it's such a general statement that I find it rather suspicious! One of the many issues surrounding the 'silence' of women (read- silencing) throughout ancient history, is that we can only guess how much work they did and how much was done by male slaves and servants."
6676,InactiveDegenerate,"Where did I say it was a side project? Didn't I specifically say that I was glad that the history of women was getting more attention? 

I really am happy that my classmates can study what they want, and that they are encouraged to do so. Women in classics are re-writing accepted notions and the idea that it was not 'men's' history but just 'human' history is very important. We're seeing a boom in books and journals discussing historical women and uncovering their histories from little snippets and hints, especially when it comes to classics. A lot of great work has been done and it's thanks to female historians who've given girls a role model in the field (Mary Beard, Lucy Worsley etc.)

I just feel uneasy at this strange peer pressure to write about ancient women just because i'm also a woman. Should I change my focus in order to fall in line with what's expected of me? My sphere of study is truly andro-centric (I mostly deal with battles/strategy) and as such women don't often feature in central roles. I just feel a little alone in it, sometimes, and I suppose that leads to frustration with my classmates when, really, I'm the one who has a problem."

6698,StupidHappyPancakes,"Let me just offer one word of caution here.  Bad men attach themselves to kind and helpful women like malignant parasites, and when they totally use us up, suddenly they don't give a damn about us.  You may feel confident that *he* would never leave *you*, but if he starts to sense too much strength or independence in you, he could decide to leave you and leave you in a BAD position.  We think these men love us, or at *very* least that they would act somewhat honorably in a breakup, but you can't count on that. 

I'm disabled and didn't have my ""own"" independent money, which kept me tethered to my abusive ex-husband until I could find SOME way to get out financially, but my health got markedly worse all of a sudden, and my ex wasn't extracting value from me anymore, so he not only left but cleaned out all the bank accounts, ran up massive credit card bills, and bought a new car with whatever was left.  This all happened over the course of ONE DAY, which seemed sudden to *me*, but he had been planning all of it out and consulting for *months* with an attorney on how to get away with it all.

If you wait until the time is right, you'll *always* be able to come up with an excuse or a reason to wait a little longer.  There IS no ""right"" time.  Don't rely on the thought that he needs you, because he could start an online fling or flirt with a new woman at work for five minutes and suddenly decide to screw you over and start a new life.  They aren't nearly as loyal as we think, and it doesn't take much for them to act dishonorably once we're not useful to them.  Don't risk letting *him* decide when ""the right time"" to end things might be."
6699,DidUWaterUrPlantsYet,"I‚Äôm not a lawyer, but from frequently perusing the legal advice and relationship subs, the overwhelming advice appears to be to make sure you do not leave the home in the separation. Supposedly the person to leave the home is significantly less likely to be able to keep the home in the divorce. That‚Äôs only what I‚Äôve read frequently though. 

Seek a lawyer and financial advisor secretly from your husband, the professional advice on what steps you should be making, whilst he is unawares for as long as possible, is crucial to protect yourself, your dog, and any children you may have, as well as your assets. 

There‚Äôs a whole new world ready to gently welcome your back once you‚Äôre ready. Good luck stranger."

It's not keeping the house that's the issue (I actually have some pretty decent blackmail material on him that I can use if necessary) - it's paying for the mortgage once it's mine.

Was the divorce lawyer able to give you any advice regarding your husband paying alimony and child support? Ie given you have a child to provide for, will those payments be enough to cover the repayments? 

If re-selling and downsizing your home is what it takes to get yourself and your child out of that toxic situation, it‚Äôs worth it, as upsetting as it would be.

Womens studies courses, OTOH, should be reinstated because they contain so many truths about women's place in society.  I  remember taking one in 1974 and we had to do some type of survey.  As an older student in my early 30s, I chose to present questionnaires to female faculty members about their treatment, opportunities, pay, etc at the community college I attended.  I got along with many of the female faculty to be honest, and this was the admin's action.   I got about 15  replies back after stuffing them into their mailboxes before I was shut down.

I mean, shouldn't they be THE most concerned with someone in their group doing so much harm to public perception and being *very* strongly critical of that, especially since Yaniv's bad behavior could have legal/political implications for *all* trans people?  It looks pretty awful if you only concern yourself with defending someone's stupid preferred pronouns when that person is a violent, litigious, pedophilic sexual predator.

Since we‚Äôre in the same city, and we‚Äôre both non-straight women, I hope you come. :)

I disagree with the slant the NBC news article has put on the story. What I‚Äôve read is that Wolf has long spoken out against homophobia and anti-lgb groups, but partnered with two conservative Christian groups in order to file joint litigation against transgender use of women-only spaces. (Perhaps this was a practical consideration: Wolf hardly has the financial or legal resources of the larger lobbying groups who were already suing. They didn‚Äôt partner with a more lgb-friendly group because those were the ones advocating for trans use of women‚Äôs spaces). As for Heritage, it looks like they held a panel discussion against the Equality Act, and some Wolf members participated and were criticized for it. 

I can‚Äôt understand why anyone would criticize a group for participating in a panel discussion. Civil dialogue between radically opposing groups is what *should* be happening. 

Because Wolf was willing to see past the politics and listen to the opposition, these groups were able to meet each other halfway, and work together to protect fundamental women‚Äôs rights. I think that‚Äôs fantastic. 

I don‚Äôt personally care if a person or group is homophobic. I‚Äôll still listen to what they have to say. It doesn‚Äôt mean we have to agree. 

What I found much more damaging than anti-gay lobby groups growing up were  ‚Äòdon‚Äôt ask, don‚Äôt tell‚Äô and the signing of the Defense of Marriage Act ‚Äî both from Bill Clinton, and reiterated by Hillary a few years later when she was a NY senator. And Obama was officially against gay marriage until he‚Äôd officially locked in his second term. I love all of them, but goddamn, they did nothing to support gay rights until it served them personally to do so. 

Anyway. Just my two cents. If you do end up going, DM me - I‚Äôll buy you a coffee. :)"

Functionally, the choice is between being silenced and being heard.  Hard left/right dichotomies are breaking down, under pressure from demographic change and a fracturing elite consensus.  Since 2016, we've learned that the left was right about the right and the right was right about the left, to a significant degree.

And the NYPL has never wavered from its original mission of making its holdings available to the world's public for free.

Today, the NYPL has five huge world-class research libraries and 92 branch libraries in the boroughs of Manhattan, The Bronx and Staten Island. By collection size, the NYPL is the third largest library in the world, and the second largest in the US, exceeded only by the US national library, the Library of Congress.  And in sharp contrast to other world-class libraries, everyone in the world is welcome to access the vast holdings in the NYPL's collections - without paying any fees or ever providing ID, proof of citizenship, letters of introduction, or credentials that show affiliation with another institution of higher learning such as a university or think tank.

6884,space_pizza_cat,"I‚Äôm shocked with this woke craziness. I understand men being so woke because as a class, they‚Äôll always find a way to oppress and shut out women and girls. But women on the left are confusing me. How they do not see what‚Äôs going on? How they don‚Äôt see how women in sports are erased? Did they ever participate in any sport in their life? You don‚Äôt have to lift weights to have any idea that men are bigger and stronger. Even in elementary school, before puberty hit us, we were divided by sex. Boys were faster, bigger and stronger. You don‚Äôt even need to know how hormones work to have an idea that after puberty, the difference in strength will be bigger. 

We fought for so long to have women‚Äôs sports... Even today, women are shamed and underestimated when it comes to sport. I‚Äôm a woman in sport, weightlifting, and it‚Äôs fucking hard to deal with men in the gym. Sexual harassment, mockery, interruptions, taking weights and equipment while you‚Äôre working with it, loud comments about your body (will you stay fuckable if you train like that?), hateful looks... once a man even started to masturbate while I was deadlifting. That‚Äôs woman‚Äôs everyday in the gum. It‚Äôs hard enough. And with this woke feeling thing it will become impossible. How hard is to understand that if a person who have gone through male puberty can compete against a person who have gone through female puberty, there‚Äôll be no women and girls in sports ever again? 

And what kills me the most is that the right wing has more logic and brain to understand this. The same crowd who thinks that violence against women isn‚Äôt violence at all, like Russians, who didn‚Äôt criminalized violence against women at all (it‚Äôs treated the same as crossing street outside the zebra crossing - you pay a fine and you‚Äôre good to go).

6887,unpauseit,Good
6888,ShootTheMoon03,Transmen and transwomen should just compete on mens teams. Transmen cant beat men anyway since they are usually smaller and their body developed female so there's no real threat. Transwomen claim they want to join sports for the experience and not for gender validation or winning so it shouldnt be a problem. Unless they want to compete with an unfair advantage ü§î. They will probably complain that its unfair to compete against other men who have not transitioned because they are disadvantaged because of the hormones they choose to take but refuse to care about women and girls who have to compete and lose against them due to their biological advantage of being male. I feel like its more fair to put the less than 1% at a 'disadvantage' than to put all women and girls at a disadvantage.

The effects of that level of testosterone are both significant and irreversible -  and anyone involved in sports at a high level knows this.

But I doubt that bellow average male athletes with a lipstick and a wig who finally found the way to win any competition will be ok with it.

Sport recognize bodies, not feelings - that‚Äôs why we have sex segregation and different body weights groups in same sport. That‚Äôs also the reasoning behind paralympic games.

6947,ShootTheMoon03,"Sure transmen are female but they are likely going to eventually take  testosterone and those who are taking it should compete on the mens team since female biology doesnt give them an advantage in sport anyway.

6948,ShootTheMoon03,"I mean that would be a more desireable solution but I dont think there are that many trans people, let alone trans people who play sport, to make this a reality.

My support of free speech, sex based protections for women and girls, and sex separatism in sports puts me further on the right side of the spectrum than the left. For the first time in my life, I plugged my nose and voted for a Republican governor and Attorney General last year. Why? Because the alternative was candidates who campaigned on promises to release half the prison population and to aggressively advance the trans agenda. My states criminal justice system is already a fucking joke, where child molesters, serial rapists, and murderers routinely receive lenient sentences. How is releasing half of the worst criminals in the state good for ANYONE??? (They were going to release prisoners based on time served, NOT based on severity of their crime or risk of reoffending)  

Also, we used to have rules that sex offenders couldn't live within 2000 feet of schools or daycares, and the sex offenders banded together to sue the state, claiming it ""exiled"" them, so what did our democratic leadership do in response?  You'd think they'd lower the restriction to something, like maybe 1000 or 500 feet restrictions right? Instead, they *dropped ALL restrictions.*  Now a convicted serial child rapist can live right next to a daycare or a school, and it's a-okay! We've seen an explosive increase in recidivism and despite the public outrage, leaders refuse to do anything about it.   

I don't share many true conservative values and beliefs, but I absolutely oppose the nonsense the left is putting out lately. I cannot and will not vote for my own erasure and the further victimization of my community. This concludes my off topic rant, lol."

Extremism...  regardless of which side it comes from is TOXIC.  If the pendulum just swings from extremist right to extremist left.., we are equally screwed.   

I personally do not believe that 50% of the country really wants to destroy the other 50%.   People want sanity and reason and logic and calm and measured.  They want center.

 Of course, black TiMs problems almost exclusively stem from them being black, male, and poor and they ironically have a significantly lower murder rate than typical black males. Letting them in women‚Äôs bathrooms isn‚Äôt going to change that one bit but the white TiMs want everyone to believe that what‚Äôs getting all these black TiMs killed is because no one validates their gender enough so they can force through all these policies using the race card and playing on people‚Äôs emotions."

If transitioning is seen as necessary to the mental health of transgender individuals and we also have a law that says you must compete with your birth sex, I dont see how there wouldnt be trouble for banning transmen from competing while they are taking 'necessary' medication. Its either going to end up with transmen on extra testosterone competing and beating every other female not on testosterone in every sport or just letting transmen compete with men, which I feel is the better compromise because it doesnt negatively impact male athletes."

6992,ShootTheMoon03,"I dont think this is defeating my own argument. Males are biologically stronger and faster than females so allowing transmen into male 
sports or making their teams open does not negatively effect the men. Having transwomen in female sports will negatively effect women because of biological advantage. Otherwise all you're doing is banning transmen who are taking extra T from competing and I doubt this is a defendable position."

Nobody should be allowed to take any artificial hormones in sports because that is cheating. There are specific rules and regulations against many forms of cheating, such as taking extra testosterone or steroids.

Edit: if people want to advocate for a third open category for both sexes, so be it. But I doubt that's going to happen any time soon, and we should still be fighting for adult female human only spaces."
7006,,"Ok I'm reading this over and over and we might be having a misunderstanding. I'm going to try to make my argument clear as I can.

This is what I mean:

""Transmen"" = adult human females who believe they're men and take artifical male hormones.

""Transwomen"" = adult human males who believe they're women and take artificial female hormones.

- Thus, adult human females (whether or not they believe they're ""transmen"" ) should compete with other adult human females. Please tell me I don't have to argue why women's only spaces are important on this sub, especially with sports.

- Taking any artifical hormones at all should be banned, because that is an unnatural, artifical advantage and is basically cheating. Just like blood doping is cheating. 

- I don't agree with how ""transmen"" subscribe to gender ideology and I think they shoot themselves in the foot in advocating for the erasure of their own sex based rights, but I'm not about to say they deserve to be with actual males for it. They're women, they belong with other women. I have no interest in throwing them to men.

If you argue at all that sex shouldn't be the necessary category for sports, you're defeating your own argument for why women's sports should be for adult human females only."

If women want to compete with men, that's up to the women, because women don't stand a chance of besting the men. It is not equivalent to men competing in women's divisions.

That's why most athletic competitions right now are women's divisions and open divisions. There are not generally ""men's"" divisions."
7013,ShootTheMoon03,You are purposefully misrepresenting what I said. I literally have said transmen wont negatively impact mens sports because they are at a physical disadvantage if they compete with men since transmen are female. Where did I imply women can become physically equal to men if they take enough hormones? Are you even reading what I'm saying or just picking arguments?
7014,MsAndThrope,"But if a female has ever taken testosterone, she is disqualified. Banned. For life. So again, TIMs will get away with it, but females won't. That's weird when they can play in the open category."
7015,ShootTheMoon03,I'm not sure if you're trying to be condescending or just being thorough but I didnt need the break down. I understood you the first time since I'm not an idiot. My argument is that by saying transwomen can compete with fellow men whether or not they transition but transmen can only compete with fellow women if they have not transitioned will ban transitioned transmen from competing in sport completely which is not a realistic position to have. Surely they will complain about being the only group barred from competing in sport while taking drugs 'necessary' for their mental health. Its not the same as women who are doping because the sole purpose of women who take those drugs is to cheat in sport or become body builders while transmen do it for a mental health reason. I'm not sure why you feel that you would need ot argue for womens only spaces to me when I've said multiple times that transwomen shouldnt be in womens sports? Sex is necessary for sport so that women can fairly compete. Men dont need sex based protections in sport because they are the ones with the biological advantage which is why mens team can be open.

7018,,"I'm a little bit confused about what you mean? What part of my statement is saying TIMs can get away with anything? TIMs should not be allowed to play in any women's sports.

Yes if a female is taking extra testosterone that should warrant disqualification. That's not fair to the women who have trained and worked hard their entire lives. Taking testosterone OR estrogen is cheating in any sport. It's not a fair competition to allow people who cheat. There's many ways of artifically altering the body beyond just taking artificial hormones, and there's many official rules against it for the sake of equal competition. 

A female taking testosterone isn't going to put her on the same athletic level of men either, there are radically different things about the male and female body beyond just testosterone. Women physically can't develop muscle in the same areas or to the same extent that men can. Please don't tell me I have to argue that there are biological, anatomical differences between males and females beyond just hormones here."
7019,,"Whether or not they like it, testosterone will increase muscle size in either sex. However, a females muscle size still will not be equal to the average male athlete, and will even grow larger in vastly different places than males. It's not fair to biological, natural female athletes who have trained their entire lives to be up against anyone taking extra testosterone. It's not fair to put females up against males, taking extra testosterone will not make them literal biological males.

It doesn't matter how much testosterone a female takes, she will not be on an equal playing field with biological male athletes. Testosterone will not increase a female's muscle size to become parallel or equal to that of a man. There are biological, anatomical differences between the structure of both sexes beyond just hormone differences. It doesn't make sense to ban men from female sports and then try to argue that a female on extra testosterone can equally compete with males. 

Sex differences exist, and for the sake of fair competition, females should compete against other females and males should compete against other males."

This was starting to fall out of style until some of these problematic men started deciding they were women and encountering conflict with women who rightly pointed out they were being disgusting and generally degrading the existence of all those around them, or encountering the sobering reality of being judged at a very critical level for their appearance by those they were attempting to seduce into their lustful fantasies, leading them to lash out and attack those around them. 

From there, they've mostly focused on women as their first target because they're already used to devaluing and attacking them, and they think that if they're able to conquer woman as a whole so that it's extremely taboo and/or illegal to differentiate between a so-called Cis-Women and Trans-Women that they'll be able to more easily manipulate those who show prejudice against the idea of being intimate with a trans-person into validating them with sexual relations and also be able to more easily worm their way into areas where they can prey on vulnerable woman such as school locker rooms, battered women's shelters, etc. (which has already begun) as well as reap the benefits they erroneously believe society awards to women  when they speak of things like ""life on easy mode"" and ""the pussy pass."""

The issue is not  ‚Äúmen don‚Äôt allow women to X‚Äù or that ‚Äúnot talking about menstruation often enough, means women are being subverted‚Äù

What is going on here is  that people of both sexes don‚Äôt like hearing about ANY other people‚Äôs biological functions and that is an all-genders issue.

 and the rest is history, men's history, where forever since their existence men have been falling over themselves in their rush to disassociate themselves from the female human

 and call themselves something unique totally separate to the female human

 and this is probably because deep inside the male psyche the core of the parasite lurks and is guiding him to the truth.. he ain't really human, he is something else?

 and of course parasites always high 5 each other when they are swarming all over their all time favourite unarmed prey.. and they even award each other gold medals as part of their long parasitic tradition in their success in marginalising and murdering their totally unaware unarmed host.

They continue to say that gender presentation =/= gender identity. And yet most of their stuff about being trans is based on either presentation or other stereotypes surrounding sex. I saw one post which suggested that trans girls should get themselves some feminine clothes they can wear in private, buy themselves a little bit of jewellery which they can claim is just 'ironic' or a friendship thing, or buy themselves a stuffed toy and say it was a present from a friend/person they like. As if these things make you 'more' of a woman?

But then they go on and on about how trans people are targeted for abuse and attacked because they're non-passing trans people. But that's a problem we have with society for ALL GNC people, especially so for highly feminine men and butch lesbians/very masculine women. And of my two non-binary friends, neither of them have been targeted for 'appearing' non-binary. One of them does have issues with misgendering/refusing to use 'they' pronouns for them, but that has nothing to do with appearance and is a family issue. My other gender-fluid friend is more gender conforming than me when she wants to be and overall probably is, though she can be very GNC when she wants to be. Neither of them could be targeted because they're both still obviously female and if anything, if you think they could be because they're trans/NB then that would imply that myself other GNC people could be targeted for 'appearing trans'. It's not 'appearing trans' which is the problem. It's gender non-conformity. "
7105,FemmeRevolutionnaire,"I think trans people are easier to clock than ever before thanks to their public activism. 10, 15 years ago most random bystanders would have assumed the average trans person was a slightly odd looking member of their chosen sex, perhaps with some medical issue. And that‚Äôs back when it wasn‚Äôt frowned upon by the trans community for people to *want* to pass and be expected to try. 

Now that everyone knows that being trans is a thing, they can‚Äôt really benefit from those assumptions all the time. Even the top tier of people who can pass impressively well still seem a bit ‚Äúoff‚Äù if you pay attention, and the ones who tend to fall into that category also have the most cosmetic surgery which adds to the uncanny effect. And of course, the behaviorial cues are a dead giveaway to anyone who knows what‚Äôs up. 

Even the best passing transwomen in the media/on YouTube come across as discount Kardashian sisters who were possessed by a drag queen. None of it exactly screams authentic womanhood."
7106,VulcanWarlockette,"I'm dying right now. I checked out the stalker sub and one of them tried to use set logic! This was their attempt: Women = {ciswomen, transwomen, ...}! Now let me prove why this is faulty logic:  

The set containing ""transwomen"" is not even a subset of the set containing all women. In order for the set containing ""transwomen"" to be considered a subset of the set containing all women, all of the elements in the set of ""transwomen"" must ALL also be in the set containing women.  

The set women = {x | x is an/are adult human(s) incapable of producing Y-sex chromosomes, capable of producing eggs, capable of carrying and sustaining a human baby in a womb, born with a vagina, has menstruation as a condition of their puberty stage  ...} The problem for ""transwomen"" is that the first condition of being a woman totally rules them out.  

I can even reverse this by defining ""transwomen."" Transwomen = {x | x is an/are an adult human man that identifies and/or desires to be a woman, are capable of producing both X- and Y-sex chromosomes, are capable of producing sperm, are born with a penis, are incapable of childbirth, do not experience menstruation as a condition of their puberty stage ...} It's obvious to US that these are two mutually exclusive groups, but our opponents, well, that's another story...  

It becomes quite clear that our opponents don't understand logic and/or this trans movement is the biggest troll movement ever."

How else can they breathlessly scream in your face about ""WORDS ARE LITERAL VIOLENCE, TERF, TERF, TERF"" at the slightest disagreement, while also fantasizing about how much they want to punch or kill TERFs?

You don't see any TiMs trying to look like Lea DeLaria or Ellen.  Or at least not very many.  Even the ones who claim to be lesbians :\

Maybe if we travel far enough down this circle-jerking rabbit hole, we‚Äôll come out the other end with gender being too conceptually fractured to factor into identity.

7145,CricketNiche,"Some people, particularly autistic people, have a lot of trouble distinguishing that. It's probably one of the reasons they're drawn to trans in the first place.

  


It allows clear rules and instructions for social situations by asking a person what they are/identify as to avoid confusion."
7146,swizzySWERF,"There are three things that usually give it away for me, in cases where it is ambiguous.

1. The eyebrows.
2. The hands.
3. The smile.  Men have never been socialized to smile the way women smile.  They don't understand that our smile literally means, ""I'm harmless, please don't kill me"".  The most manly looking TIF generally still has the ""please don't kill me"" smile, while the most feminine looking TIM will look like they are trying to figure out how their facial muscles work.  TIMs tend to try a sultry pout or wind up smirking like a serial killer.  They don't involve their eye muscles, so the smile seems fake.

This photo is a good example of the difference.

Of course, in real life these things do much less, but so much of trans ideology is linked to technology now--they use these alterations and then slap a 'cute' photo filter on their dating profiles, then declare themselves to be women. It's really ruined online dating for me after getting catfished by a man in drag (not fully catfished in that I kicked him out immediately after realizing it, but still)."
7148,myradfemexploration,"The hormone therapy apparently can affect some of these characteristics: plus there is feminine facial reconstruction surgery, where they literally surgically change those characteristics. I have to say, some people do pass."
7149,swizzySWERF,"They don't think it's hypocritical though.  The thinking goes like this:

* Trans women are women, just like disabled women are women.
* ""Cis"" women have experiences of womanhood that are not universal to all women: they bleed, they have babies, they go through menopause, etc.
* Trans women, on the other hand, have experiences of womanhood that are 100% universal: they experience sexual assault, sexism, and misogyny.
* Therefore, the only ""women"" who can speak for *all women* are trans women, because only they have a universally relatable experience of womanhood.

I wish I was joking.  I thought women had pretty universal experiences until we enlarged the category of ""woman"" to include men.  Who now think they are the only correct spokespeople for all women."

* The last mod is active, but not so much in the butchlesbians subreddit recently.

If you can't tell who is trans or not just by looking, as she claimed, then you also can't tell who is ""cis"" or not just by looking.  You can't assume anything about a person's gender at all.  Libfems go nuts when you make assumptions about gender, so it was especially surprising that she'd just assume I was ""cis"".

That, and the old, ""If you don't transition to live as your true self, your depression will spiral out of control until you kill yourself."" Those first few months, that first year, I was terrified that *this* was actually the big mistake, that I was a transman in denial, I was just being cowardly because I didn't want to deal with societal shit about being trans, that I was losing the chance to transition young and establish my adult life as a man so that if I really needed to transition as they told me I inevitably would then I'd have to do it mid-career or even mid-relationship which could be disastrous, that I was making trans people and the trans community look bad if it really was just a phase or internalized homophobia for me, and so much more.

What worked was telling myself to calm down, that I couldn't live in denial of my true opinions (just as I couldn't keep going to church when I decided I was atheist no matter how much I liked that particular community), and I would check in every so often for my mental health and analyze whether I was getting better or worse, and I could always change my mind and transition at any time, and that a year or two to think about it isn't as long as it seems when you're 20 (which still isn't as long as it seems when you're 16 or 13). It wasn't until it had been about five years and my mental health was better than ever (because I'd been working on my other psychological issues - including physical health which made a huge difference for mental health - instead of reassuring myself that once I transitioned it would be better, and I couldn't truly be happy until I transitioned so what was the point of putting in all the hard work to not be miserable if you think it's inevitable?)"

Girls sue to block participation of transgender athletes

The families of three female high school runners have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block transgender athletes in Connecticut from participating in girls sports

By PAT EATON-ROBB AP Sports Writer

February 12, 2020

HARTFORD, Conn. -- The families of three female high school runners filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday seeking to block transgender athletes in Connecticut from participating in girls sports.

Selina Soule, a senior at Glastonbury High School, Chelsea Mitchell, a senior at Canton High School and Alanna Smith, a sophomore at Danbury High School are represented by the conservative nonprofit organization Alliance Defending Freedom. They argue that allowing athletes with male anatomy to compete has deprived them of track titles and scholarship opportunities.

‚ÄúMentally and physically, we know the outcome before the race even starts,"" said Smith, who is the daughter of former Major League pitcher Lee Smith. ‚ÄúThat biological unfairness doesn't go away because of what someone believes about gender identity. All girls deserve the chance to compete on a level playing field.‚Äù

The lawsuit was filed against the Connecticut Association of Schools-Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference and the boards of education in Bloomfield, Cromwell, Glastonbury, Canton and Danbury.

‚ÄúForcing girls to be spectators in their own sports is completely at odds with Title IX, a federal law designed to create equal opportunities for women in education and athletics,‚Äù attorney Christiana Holcomb said. ""Connecticut‚Äôs policy violates that law and reverses nearly 50 years of advances for women.‚Äù

The Connecticut Association of Schools-Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference says its policy follows a state anti-discrimination law that says students must be treated in school by the gender with which they identify and the group believes the policy is ‚Äúappropriate under both state and federal law.‚Äù

The lawsuit follows a Title IX complaint filed last June by the girls' families and the Alliance Defending Freedom with the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, which is investigating the policy.

The lawsuit centers on two transgender sprinters, Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood, who have frequently outperformed their cisgender competitors.

The two seniors have combined to win 15 girls state indoor or outdoor championship races since 2017, according to the lawsuit.

The three plaintiffs have competed directly against them, almost always losing to Miller and usually behind Yearwood. Mitchell finished third in the 2019 state championship in the girls 55-meter indoor track competition behind Miller and Yearwood.

‚ÄúOur dream is not to come in second or third place, but to win fair and square,‚Äù Mitchell said. ‚ÄúAll we're asking for is a fair chance.‚Äù

Yearwood, of Cromwell High School, and Miller, of Bloomfield High School, have both defended their participation in girls events.

Yearwood told The Associated Press in February 2019 that there are many differences among athletes that may give one a physical advantage over another, and that she does not think she has an unfair advantage.

""One high jumper could be taller and have longer legs than another, but the other could have perfect form, and then do better,"" she said. ""One sprinter could have parents who spend so much money on personal training for their child, which in turn, would cause that child to run faster.""

Yearwood's mother said the athlete had no immediate comment on Wednesday's lawsuit. Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The attorneys are asking the court to prevent the transgender girls from competing while the lawsuit moves forward. No hearing date on that request had been scheduled Wednesday, the day before the state's indoor track championships begin.

Connecticut is one of 17 states that allowed transgender high school athletes to compete without restrictions in 2019, according to Transathlete.com, which tracks state policies in high school sports across the country. Eight states had restrictions that make it difficult for transgender athletes to compete while in school, such requiring athletes to compete under the gender on their birth certificate, or allowing them to participate only after going through sex reassignment procedures or hormone therapies, according to Transathlete.

Yearwood and Miller have said they are still in the process of transitioning but have declined to provide details."
7239,gcsubthrow,"And of course the thread on /rall is locked. I guess too many fee fees and not enough validation happened. Die mad, TRAs!"
7240,ShootTheMoon03,"I knew there was no way those Connecticut track girls were happy or accepting of boys unfairly beating them and taking their titles/awards. Even the most woke person can see this is incredibly unfair and this does nothing to improve trans acceptance. Hopefully they win their case. That boy and his mother had the gall to say that he worked hard to win and break records, implying those girls didnt win because they didnt work hard enough to overcome the biological advantage males have. I hope they restore old records from actual girls that these boys stole."
7241,Noizyhan,"The comments are spot on. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve always said - TRAs will end up completely shooting themselves in the foot over this ridiculous idea that sex-based rights are transphobic. Because when presented with actual real-life situations, most people become terfs..... or, you know, realists."
7242,JulienMayfair,It's so sad to see a formerly courageously-principled organization like the ACLU come down on the wrong side of this issue. Postmodern gender ideology is so insidious; it poisons everything it touches.
7243,denverkris,"This very issue is what helped peak me about a year ago. The males in question have done literally nothing except maybe grow their hair out/get extensions and adopt a girls name. That's it. Other than that they are as full fledged boys as any other boy. One of them had the nerve to say something like ""well the other girls should just work harder"" or some shit. F\*ck off dude. Neither of them placed higher than like 8th in the boys division and then suddenly they're winning state championships as girls, big fucking surprise."
7244,hellamomzilla,Good for them. The really brave and stunning young women in this situation.
7245,DangerousJellyfish,">‚ÄúThe idea that the law only protects the individuals with XX chromosomes as compared to individuals with XY chromosomes is found nowhere in the legislative history of Title IX, in any implementing regulation or in any other aspect of the interpretation of Title IX over the last 50 years by the courts,‚Äù he said.

This is why biological sex matters and words matter. When that legislation was made, we all knew ""woman"" meant ""XX"" and nobody had to fucking say it. Title IX is about WOMEN, that means XX chromosomes and all that goes along with that in the vast majority of cases. If XY people are included as well, in this lawyer's asinine statement, then Title IX also includes cis men and is completely invalid and schools no longer have to make sure women are getting sports teams and equal chances to participate. You could just have one team of regular boys and another of boys who say they identify as women, and now you've met Title IX requirements.

You'd think a fucking lawyer would think through the implications of their statements before speaking... jesus fucking christ.

Edit: please forgive any crude oversimplifications of Title IX; I am Canadian so I only understand the basics."
7246,Ethereal-Fox,"This is great! When I found out a trans man won a women's cycling race a while ago, I was so pissed, especially since that's a sport that's really important to me and I know how difficult it is to train for this. The dude essentially stole the victory from a girl who deserved the win. The same goes for essentially any other sport. This crap needs to stop"
7247,BarkDait,"This is what a bunch of ""human rights"" groups, including the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, said in response to the complaint filed:

>‚ÄúAs organizations that care deeply about ending discrimination against women and girls, we support laws and policies that protect transgender people from discrimination, including in participation in sports. Together, we reject unfounded fears about transgender athletes in our state and reject the suggestion that cisgender women and girls benefit from the exclusion of women and girls who happen to be transgender. Instead, we recognize that all women and girls are harmed when some are denied opportunities to participate in sports because of stereotypes and fear.‚Äù

Makes my blood boil. Note how they phrase biological women as ""cisgender women"" but phrase TIMs as ""women and girls who ***happen to be*** transgender"". 

#**internally screaming**"
7248,buttsbelike,"Yes, keep defending the xy people of the world, they've never had a fighting chance being male, no privileges, no advantages, nothing, these poor poor little boys and their struggles to protect their delicate egos.

I juuust..... Can't. Like, we have a special Olympics, so hey, let's make a trans Olympics. Stop the invasion of women's spaces!!"
7249,BarkDait,"The body being sued by these girls, Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference, just released this statement:

>CHESHIRE, Conn. ‚Äì The Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference (CIAC) is committed to equity in providing opportunities to student athletes in Connecticut. In 2013 the CIAC adopted its current policy regarding transgender participation in athletics. When first adopting that policy and when subsequently reviewing it, the CIAC consulted with and relied on statements and advice from numerous bodies and organizations, including the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities, the Connecticut State Department of Education, the National Federation of State High School Associations, and the Office for Civil Rights.  The CIAC believes that its current policy is appropriate under both state and federal law, and it has been defending that policy in the complaint that was filed previously with the Office of Civil Rights.  Although OCR‚Äôs investigation is still pending, the CIAC is aware that a lawsuit has now also been filed in federal court. The CIAC will respond to that lawsuit after we have a chance to review it further.

7250,MichaelGCu,"I'm trying to find an article from February 2019 in which Chelsea Mitchell came in 3rd behind Yearwood and Miller and was trying to deal with it, when by all rights she should have taken first place.  It was heart breaking.  She was bewildered, trying to absorb that males had been allowed to compete, she knew it was unfair at its core, but was biting her tongue not to say anything unPC.

I'm glad she's on this lawsuit.  Hopefully, there will be an injunction against the cheaters, then they can work on restoring the titles to the rightful winners, declaring Miller's and Yearwood's times null and void."
7251,ironbasementwizard,"The comments are really telling about what the general public thinks. Aka everyone KNOWS that trans women are male and trans men are female. Lots of comments like ""It's not fair for biological men to compete with women""

""according to Transathlete.com, which tracks state policies in high school sports across the country.

This is what happens when we lose our language and ""women"" no longer means female. It means that laws created to protect women are now a tool to oppress them because ""women"" can be people with XY chromosomes too, and they are also a protected class under federal law. 

Also the quote by the trans runner was moronic and misogynistic, fuck him."
7256,breadandrosestoo,"There was an article last week in my hometown newspaper about the recent legislation brought in several states banning trans athletes in schools, and I read the comments.

At this level, sure love of the game is great, but there are RECORDS and AWARDS and SCHOLARSHIPS on the line!  And why can't Yearwood and Miller just run for ""the love of the game"" and not to be best?  Shows how seriously people take women's sports today even.  I'm not even INTO sports and I'm FURIOUS."

Why don‚Äôt these trans athletes compete with boys? Because they won‚Äôt have an advantage? Is it really about needing to be seen as a girl?"

7266,leanflavouredsundae,"_""The idea that the law only protects the individuals with XX chromosomes as compared to individuals with XY chromosomes is found nowhere in the legislative history of Title IX""..._

Chase Strangio is such a disingenuous little shit. Yes, we _know_ that's not reflected in title IX. You know what is reflected, very clearly? Not excluding access to education ""on the basis of sex."" It says it right there! You don't just get to shoehorn in gender identity now that the same legislative title could be construed to defend the rights of natal women to participate in sports and other opportunities on their terms, without having to compete against natal males.

Sometimes it really does seem like this is the most successful right wing conspiracy of all time."
7293,Throwaway_Baelish,"Chase Strangio, the lawyer quoted, is a TIF. She‚Äôs also wrong.

Title IX:
> No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

There language is clear‚Äî ‚Äúon the basis of sex‚Äù. These young men are not being excluded on the basis of their sex because the school already offers a team for ‚Äúindividuals with XY chromosomes‚Äù, the boys team. Yearwood and Miller have the same opportunities afforded to any other male classmate to try out for and participate on their schools‚Äô teams.

The problem for them (that no one wants to mention) is that their times in the boys field are laughably average. In the state meets they wouldn‚Äôt even qualify for the sprint prelims, much less the finals.

Miller‚Äôs best time in the 100m is an 11.74. The cutoff at the CT outdoor track state championship in the boys 100m prelims last year was 11.61. Yearwood‚Äôs times have actually gotten worse since he started going up against Miller. His fastest 100m in 2019 was a 12.22. 

As for Strangio, she is legitimately deranged. Seriously. That Chase refuses to recognize her own (and others) biological sex is her issue. That she takes it out on the rest of us is disgusting."
7294,closetskeleton_girl,"He knows it.  He's being disingenuous.   It's not in the legislative history because the definition of ""woman"" or ""man"" has been stable for the entirety of human history until this point.  Legislators aren't usually required to explicitly spell out universal truths understood by everyone in legislation.   God I hope the courts don't bite onto this bullshit argument.   It completely undermines the entire legislative purpose of Title IX.  If anyone can just declare themselves a member of a protected class, then protected classes no longer exist.

His interpretation, if accepted by courts, would set a dangerous precedent that could apply to other protected classes too.  After all, if one can identify as the opposite sex, it follows logically that one could identify as any age, race, or disabled status too."

I see comments and post constantly asking, ""Oh can I post here? I'm just a trans"" and blah blah, begging for validation. I see plenty of lesbians making posts wishing they could find a woman, with trans swooping as fast as they can with pick up lines.

Any meme about coming out, or lesbian sex, they ALWAYS have to make a comment about how much they can relate to this, or some shit. You did *not* have to go through ""coming out"", you have liked women as a straight man your entire life, and was told it was okay. You have no idea the fear and judgement that comes along with being a lesbian. The craziest part of it all? The women.

The women stroking their egos, ""Oh it's okay you're a 6' woman, I'm tall too, I would date you!"" 
Or the women responding ignorantly "" Of course you are welcome here, you are a woman who likes women right? So no problem here, anyone says anything and they are a TERF"".

Lesbians who don't agree, get their comments downvoted and deleted so fast your head spins.
On the lesbian gamers subreddit, its constantly trans asking to go on microphone with you and saying ""Oh btw, I haven't taken any hormones yet so my voice is still deep""...
because that's why I came to a lesbian gamers subreddit, to talk to a man who secretly just wants to get a lesbian to sleep with him.

I feel like there is no safe haven anymore, and at this point can we create one for REAL lesbian women? Where we can still have a group that we can actually *relate* to, and feel safe in? I'm not sure where to even begin to create one, but if anyone wants to try I'm in. I am fed up."

7452,Vinylmaniac,"I was the only lesbian and one of two gays at a local queer night. The other being a gay man. The other queers were basically straight men with beards and nail varnish, hetro couples calling themselves pan but seem to be uneasy with authentic homosexuality. Pan-Hetros into poly or kink but only in a heterosexual context.
 The other was a weekend cross-dresser (cross dressers have been part of the scene forever and tend to be cool).  I was tret like an impostor though infringing on a hettie hook up space!

This is why gays are deserting 'rainbow flag' events, or are being ambiguous about their true sexuality - as young hipster hetros and couples now dominate the scene - changing the dynamic.  No, they weren't trans either.

The tricky thing is,  the hettie couples make such events viable however, in a disco... a rare treat,  gays don't feel comfortable in hettie dominated spaces. 

What to do?"
7453,--wellDAM--,"Let me tell you that most lesbians are having none of it, ESPECIALLY old school lesbians. 

This is where feminism started and this is where we hold the fucking line. I‚Äôve been a pretty loud and unapologetic feminist for a while, so I‚Äôve got a nice support network and mentors who I trust and the gay women I know have a pretty tight sort of underground resolve that I haven‚Äôt seen in straight feminist groups and definitely not in hysterical lib fems. 

All we have to do as rad fems is hold the line and inch forward. 

I recommend every radical feminist read books about narcissism and male violence to understand these guys and their harem. It‚Äôs classic male violence in every way and if you navigate interactions with TIMs and TRAs *exactly* as you would a clinically diagnosed narcissistic psychopath, you‚Äôll come away cleaner and usually unbeaten."

7458,onemoredaydream,"That sub was started as a space for women who are coming out later in life to connect and talk- because women who have past experiences with men are often given the side eye in lesbian spaces.  And talking about the feelings we have about coming out is old hat to a lot of lesbians who have been out for a while. 

I took on co-coordinating the sub when it was getting started.  It was started specifically to be gender critical.  It started from a thread we were having on truelesbians - a space where I normally stay silent.

The other organizer bait and switched it - they agreed they were g.c. to begin, and then immediately they began editing the FAQ of the sub to say that TWAW and that to participate in the space, you had to agree to use Crazy Talk (queer language bullshit) and not talk about anything deemed transphobic.

I decided to fade out rather than engage with that level of crazy - you never know who you are talking to online and I didn't want a stalker.  I ended up deleting my acct and starting a new one (something I do every year or so for security).  

But yea - just so we're all clear- some gay women tried to carve out their own space out of respect for the existing lesbian spaces.  An internet rando who was apparently trawling /r/truelesbians had a convincing enough catfish account that I was fooled into thinking they were gc.  Once they were in a mod-spot, they switched out the content and I didn't want to get into a battle with some suddenly crazy stranger.

So let‚Äôs take the gloves off. Stop worrying about what you‚Äôll lose. Start thinking about what you‚Äôll gain, and what society and women will gain when we get these men back where they belong: out of the women‚Äôs movement. 

It‚Äôs no new anarchy. It‚Äôs just men being men and weak, terrified women being abused and lied to and manipulated. 

It‚Äôs the 1950s heterosexual marriage dynamic. Big loud angry man expects dinner and a clean home and a hole to fuck: wife thinks it‚Äôs her job to comply. When she does, she gets to feel something that imitates meaning, having no real direction or critical thinking ability. 

After years and years, she doesn‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs abuse. It‚Äôs normal and she‚Äôs proud of her spotless home and bougie dinner parties and her husband drinks with the boys while she parents and scrubs dishes. She has no identity so she‚Äôs proud to be his barnacle.

It honestly seems like they don't give two shits about being liked or gaining support organically; they are the least sympathetic ""victims"" ever.  I was just commenting today on r/itsafetish that it's really weird that the trans community doesn't seem to *care* about their public image, and they don't discourage one another from *publicly* posting that TIMs fake periods for sexual gratification, or do forceful medication-induced breastfeeding of infants for sexual gratification, or imagine being little girls for sexual gratification...you get the idea.

It seems like a BIG part of the thrill is the fact that they're openly behaving this way, yet they know people are too afraid to speak up and stop them.  The compulsive violation of women's boundaries and *a* particularly woman's boundaries seems to be even more sexually thrilling than the dressing up as women part.  I have zero explanation as to why they have been *so* successful in such a short time despite the trans activists behaving in such repulsive ways, and right in the public eye, too.

I mean, can you *imagine* a woman publishing an article that her wife had a baby and she took it away immediately to breastfeed the infant a drug cocktail induced ""milk,"" and got off on *sexually* on it?  Or a woman reading stories to toddlers and *flashing her vagina* repeatedly, then when confronted about it, giggling that she ""must have forgotten to wear panties that day"" (as women do, right? üôÑ).  Or how about a female politician speaking on stage in a skintight, see-through dress that *clearly* shows every outline of her genitalia?

A reasoned and sound explanation is all most people need for a life raft while they‚Äôre drowning in the sea of TRA hysteria and finger pointing. Then they can catch their breath and help others."
7527,DoctorOsmium,The biggest allies of TIMs seem to be hordes of woke bisexual girls who don't seem to understand (or deliberately ignore the reason) why lesbians would have a problem dating a biologically male person.
7528,ventuckyspaz,This gay man stands with his lesbian sisters. We just need to hang in there and stay grouped together. What the trans community is doing to women is extremely disturbing. Trans people treat women's rights like they are worthless and that women are a lower class of people. Women didn't fight this hard for equal rights to have men in dresses trample all over them and demand to have their lady dicks sucked. The madness needs to stop and it only will if more of us takes a stand and call out what they are doing.

We will never be completely free of this rhetoric, because inevitably, lesbians are the primary targets of this shit. Heterosexual males in dresses have convinced everyone they are infallible goddesses, and Good Lesbians need to fall in line. But LC had a few letters and discussions about it last year and ultimately fell on the side of ""we are done talking about this"". You occasionally see someone trying to pander to *inclusivity*, but it's really not relevant. We are just lesbians.

I have held so many jobs with male bosses where I have been advised by friends and family to act as therapist and personal assistant and nanny and nurse to ‚Äúkeep him happy.‚Äù

I live in Canada where we have this Bell ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Talk‚Äù day about mental health which encourages people to express their emotions to help with their anxiety and depression. It‚Äôs bullshit because women get punished for speaking up. Bell fired a woman for talking to her boss about her depression but men speak up and everyone is like ‚Äúhow brave of you to come forward and seek help.‚Äù When women come forward it‚Äôs ‚Äúshe‚Äôs incompetent, she‚Äôs hysterical, she‚Äôs lying‚Äîit can‚Äôt be THAT bad.‚Äù 

My brothers always had their feelings considered before mine and I hated childhood because of it. It was extraordinarily damaging to have my feelings ignored all the time. 

I honestly can‚Äôt think of any circumstance where truthfully relaying my feelings has advantaged me."
7548,,"My younger by 3 years brother and I both struggle with mental illness. However, the way he expressed it was punching holes in walls, screaming, calling my mother a c‚Äî-, calling my father an asshole, and destroying stuff. He got everything he wanted because they were afraid of him, he‚Äôs been over 6ft and 200lbs since he was like 15. His problems were focused on because his were ‚Äúmore severe‚Äù. He was diagnosed as having high functioning aspergers and bipolar disorder. I have bipolar II and anxiety.

I am 5‚Äô tall. I didn‚Äôt punch holes in the walls. I self harmed. I had bulimia for 14 years and need $14,000 of dental work I‚Äôll never be able to afford. I waited too long to get help because I thought *my pain doesn‚Äôt matter because I‚Äôm not violent.*I have a hernia in my stomach and GERD from the disease as well. I decided I had enough and went to recovery. I‚Äôm recovered now for about eight months, my longest streak in 14 years.

This has caused a complex that has followed me to today ‚Äî my problems don‚Äôt matter as much as anyone else‚Äôs. I need to shut up about my problems. I shut up when I‚Äôm in pain. I refuse help constantly, especially from my mom. She‚Äôs had so much heart ache and stress over my brother and I that I usually hide how sick I‚Äôm feeling. I have a chronic illness that causes a lot of problems but I feel too unimportant to deserve help. 

I wanted my parents, especially my mother who is in poor health, to have one ‚Äúnormal kid‚Äù. Every time my mother tells me about my brother calling her names (he loooves gendered slurs) for trying to help him it breaks my fucking heart. I‚Äôm afraid that one day she‚Äôs going to have a heart attack and die over the stress he causes her. 

People are afraid of violent men. Violent men get what they want. Violent men are treated like they‚Äôre special because people are afraid of the consequences. Whenever I speak to him, I need to make sure to talk to him with the right words, tone, and cadence. Every conversation is a dance on egg shells with cleats, you have to look at his face and read his facial expressions. You are not allowed to disagree with anything he says, even if it goes against your beliefs. I understand that 1000%, it‚Äôs so fucked up not being able to speak to someone normally because you‚Äôre scared of saying one wrong word and setting off the fuse to a bomb."
7549,Novemberinthechair,"I'm always hearing ""Men stuff their emotions down"" or some version of that. Like, what the hell do people think women do? If we aren't using the indoor voice people accuse us of screeching. Shit, even if we aren't being emotional someone will say the opposite if they don't like what we're saying.

&#x200B;

One time I saw news anchor Katy Tur talking to some slub, she kept pushing him to answer a question. He was getting defensive as hell, so you know, he pulled a reversal.

&#x200B;

""Katy, why are you getting so emotional?"" He kept saying to her. She, as cool as a cucumber, responded, ""I can assure you, senator, I'm not feeling emotional right now."" She knew he'd never say that to a dude.

7550,OrneryStruggle,"You're correct of course. Literally almost the entire canon of ""classic"" literature, music, theatre, film is based around forcing all of society to focus on and praise male emotion, no matter how petty and ridiculous. Male authors pioneered the stream of thought narrative most women would be too polite to impose on their poor readers, and got praised for it to boot. Males lack the ability to regulate their emotions from an early age, resulting in worse academic performance in schools, higher aggression and criminality, etc. but this is never pointed out by men as a problem they need to solve.   


The level of delusion people need to be operating under to think that the female sex is the more ""emotional"" sex and that our emotions are more ""socially acceptable"" is mindboggling - I never believed this propaganda even as a small child. Great post, you have explained really well how this insidious lie operates in society."
7551,takingchances1,"Thank you for this. I needed to read this today. I have been told I‚Äôm overemotional, too sensitive, difficult etc throughout my childhood and also to a lesser extent even now. I‚Äôm starting to realize that maybe people just never liked seeing a girl standing up for herself, or pretend not to be negatively affected by events such as the ones you mentioned.

When I was in fifth grade a group of boys bullied me and my two best (female) friends. They taunted us and occasionally things even got physical. I told my mother who thankfully advices me to tell my teacher. She did nothing for several months but eventually I managed to get her to set up a meeting with her, me, and the leader of the boys present. I told him about the emotional repercussions his actions had had on me, and how awful I felt, and he started crying.

I ended up having to apologize for making him cry. I was told off by my teacher for being overly aggressive and angry. The subject was then never brought up again and I changed schools for sixth grade."

I grew up with the fear of ""saying the wrong thing"" and setting him off. I remember once, we were sitting around the tea-table.

7557,,"Honestly, preach. I can't even count all the times men threw a hissy fit, but if a woman dared to raise her voice in the situation she was brigaded. Men have all the privilege to act however they wish to and fully express their emotions and **choose** not to while simultaneously pretending it's the other way around. Same thing happens with men pretending women have an easy mode life, while the answer is clearly different. Tbh there's probably far more male projecting, because they refuse to acknowledge the reality where the world is completely biased to accommodate them and that they hold the responsibility to change it if they want to be called 'allies' or 'progressives'. Unfortunately libfems and alike coddle them in this delusional wordview because 'muh suicide rate'."

7568,Whatisreal999,"The majority of men are often hysterical, irrational, angry and child-like. The only acceptable emotional state for us is that of ""good mommies"";  loving, caring, nurturing, supportive, calming and non-judgmental at all times.

Any other emotional response causes them acute distress - and then we are blamed for it.

I am so tired of it - father, boyfriends, husband, my best gay male friend, co-workers, employees - my whole life has been spent managing, navigating and responding to their emotional immaturity while managing and supressing my own emotions.

Just last week I had a male manager act terribly during a staff meeting (negative, sulky, angry). He recognized it and came to my office after to apologize. However, it turns out it was all my fault. When he had come into my office earlier in the day ranting and raving about something - I had glanced at my computer to see the time and mentioned that I had a conference call so I only had 2 minutes. Apparently,his behaviour in the meeting was because he felt I didn't care and had looked at my computer while he was expressing himself earlier....

7584,CwasCard,"I‚Äôm gonna give my two cents on the issue from my personal viewpoint
I am a 13 year old boy, turning 14 in a few days
It all depends on who you associate yourself with - for instance, I am an African, my parents are directly from Nigeria. My parents, my *dad* in particular do not want me to shed a single tear, regardless of the situation.
If I express emotion through hand signals (jazz hands when excited, sulking posture when sad, ETC), they also get angry/disappointed, as do the rest of my African contacts.
When I‚Äôm with my American friends, it‚Äôs the exact opposite. They know my home situation, and are *entirely* OK with me expressing my emotions. 

Surprisingly, your childhood‚Äôs situation is the exact opposite of mine - my mom is home far more often then my dad, and she *lavishes* affection onto my sisters - both younger and older. They‚Äôre both allowed to cry, hit me, ETC, but if I mimic their behavior to get them to buzz off, I get into a world of trouble. Now, the men you associate yourself with are likely people like my dad - outdated beliefs that they refuse to change. But, I feel you for the most part, a lot of my African associates mirror the men you were talking about *perfectly.*

so. uh. I think it‚Äôs really about who you associate yourself with. I‚Äôve dealt with both males and females who emulate the men you describe. but hey. You‚Äôre an adult, and this is from a child‚Äôs perspective; I could be entirely wrong."
7585,notafemme,"My husband has the best answer ever for this:
A) testosterone is linked to aggressive behavior, violence, etc
B) men have more testosterone
Therefore:
C) Masculinity which teaches men to be in control of their emotions is a good thing. It's better for a potentially violent male to control himself, even at personal cost, than to be a loose cannon endangering others (and most of my more traditional- minded male friends would add that it is a man's responsibility to protect women from male violence at all costs). 

I totally identify with you, OP. It one of my huge issues as someone who leans left politically. My father is a Christian who believes in women being subject to her husband and such. But he never tolerated my brother abusing me. My mother, the so-called feminist, made my brother's issues the priority and that side of my family hates me to this day for going to my father for help in not getting beat on. The older I've gotten, the more I've seen the value of traditional masculinity. Men should be self controlled and willing to fight for their families. To quote a meme a very conservative friend of mine posted the other day: ""A real woman can do it all. A real man wouldn't let her."" While I don't agree with men ""letting"" women do anything, I agree with the sentiment that women should be strong and capable and men should be out there taking care of their families. The issue I have with traditional gender roles is that conservatives pretend that women can't or don't have these same positive traits, and try to force women into dependency on men. But the whole idea that a man should suck it up and do right by his family: I'm all for that. I'd take one of my benevolently sexist union brothers who turns their paycheck over to the management of their stay at home wife every week than a hundred men who run up credit card debt to buy makeup and be ""femme""."

7596,Aslan_reed,"I relate to a lot of the struggles you've described here.  I'm so sorry you have to deal with all of that.  I hope you stay strong in your recovery.  You deserve to be healthy.  

I spent years feeling that way about my older brother and my father.  I vividly remember the last time my brother hit me.  I had accidentally scuffed his toe while trying to carefully walk around him.  It must have hurt because he immediately struck me in the face.  It was in front of several of our friends.   Everyone in the room looked shocked, even him.  He was in his late teens at the time (I'm several years younger).

I just kind of laughed about it, trying to smooth things over, but the uncomfortable moment just dragged on.  His violence had rarely been so public, so unfounded and so overt as nearly an adult.  I think it forced him to recognize how inappropriate and extreme his behavior had become.  

I responded to another comment a while down saying almost exactly the same thing you said here.  ""Violent men get what they want. Violent men are treated like they‚Äôre special because people are afraid of the consequences.""  This is exactly right.  Dead on.  He grew up knowing from our father and from the adult responses to his increasingly violent behavior that he would be catered to.  That his emotional outbursts were something that I should control with my behavior.  

I still have nightmares about people not helping me.  About people not believing me when I'm in a dangerous situation.  How many people saw him attack me when we were growing up?  How many times did I sit in timeout because ""we were fighting"", when that fight consisted of him wailing on me while I tried to cover my face and defend myself?"

I do occasionally enjoy a true brainless 'chick lit' book, but there are plenty of women writing powerful literary fiction about relationships and families - yet they all get the same front cover (set of heels/ lipstick kiss/ whimsical flowers) and they sure don't get awards. Only when men write about love and family life is it 'literature.'

They are furious at the way they are treated and the way their bodies are constantly assessed.  That anger has to go somewhere and when it's not allowed out into the world it turns inward.  Self harm, eating disorders, precocious sexuality...  Even the mental illnesses caused by the way our emotions are viewed are treated with mockery and contempt."

7618,Aslan_reed,"I disagree.  Take for example the trending story of John Stewart standing up before Congress.  There are several points at which he is obviously fighting back tears.  Imagine a woman in the same situation and ask whether or not her display of emotions would be treated with such respect. 

Terry Crews talking about his #MeToo moments, vs the countless stream of women.  

Take men's excitement over sports games or video games.  Their interest and excitement is perceived positively.  Whereas women with the same sort of passions are mocked.  Women's hobbies are treated like jokes.

Take for example the difference is societal consideration for men's trauma vs women's.  PTSD from combat vs PTSD from rape or domestic violence.  

Look at the difference in the way we treat male arousal and attraction vs female.  

Acceptable male emotions aren't just anger or aggression, men just prefer anger and aggression as ways of solidifying their power.  Anger and aggression are effective ways to get what you want, particularly when you already occupy socially dominant positions, especially white men.  It's pervasive in our culture because it works.  Look at the difference between the way anger from black men is perceived vs the anger from white men.  

Even women's allowable emotional range comes with the perception of immaturity.  Even positive women's emotions are treated much like the emotions of children.  

I think it's a massive oversimplification to say that male emotions are only permissible within the realm of anger."

I learned about Joyce endlessly throughout school and was forced to read three of his books but Woolf was never even mentioned and I only found out about her myself because I did most of my reading outside of academic contexts. There definitely are female authors in the classic literature canon who we recognize in schools/mainstream culture today but there are way more men, and a lot of those male authors write endlessly about feelings, emotions, etc. from a male perspective. I'm not even saying classic lit by male authors is bad or their emotions aren't interesting, but the idea that we don't ""let"" men express and explore emotions is just ridiculous to me - our culture is just so inundated with male emotion it's a background buzz we don't even consciously notice."

If the boy was doing the same, he would stand there and whine ""I can't do it"" and very quickly my sister would break down and say it was easier for her to just do it herself than to make him comply.

Now he did not pull that crap when I was taking care of them because the first time he did, I told him what the consequences would be if he did not do what he was told and he tried to push it. And one time sitting there whining while his sister and the other kids got to enjoy a much desired dessert fixed him up fast. Of course, he kept pulling this stunt with his Mom afterwards.

7654,4eyedPurplePPLeater,"Absolutely this... & in during catastrophes like the titanic, there were women that gave up their seats for someone else, or to stay behind with their husbands. People forget that many women were unable to swim because they were taught our reproductive organs made women unable. Women also had heavy, heavy clothing/ dresses, so pretty much impossible to move in water.       

With war, it wasn't chivalry, but an attempt at preservation of their cultures; men deeming women ""bad luck"", men not being able to control themselves, men leaving women out, etc,.... all decisions made by men. Replacing men is easier than women, who can only give child birth about once a year, that is, if a woman doesn't die, have severe complications, can get pregnant, etc. That wasn't some kind of privilege men bestowed upon women, it was chaining women to their reproductive abilities. Women were also there to fill in the roles of men.         

Notice men never show anger towards the MALE elite that makes the decisions... no, it's like the selfish, sick males that kill their whole family before killing themselves -- if they feel they are suffering, they want to force even more suffering onto women. They like to conveniently leave out horrible events where women did suffer/ die, in equal, or greater numbers."

Some of the biggest issues did come to a head with my mother after my father passed.  I think she resented me for years.  We had some textbook maternal alienation going on as well as inter generational trauma.  She suffered greatly due to her mother, stepmother and sisters and failed to connect with me early on.  This was solidified because I was very much my father's daughter.  I was his golden child, where my older brother was often the black sheep.  We were constantly pitted against one another for limited (positive) attention and affection.  Hence, why I don't blame my brother for his over the top violence when we were kids.  It's really hard to love your sister when your father calls you ""the black hole of happiness in this family"" or Satan, while emphasizing ""why can't you be more like her?""  

I've gotten some apologies for specific things that happened over the years--things that poisoned my relationship with my mother almost beyond repair.  I've gotten a lot of excuses and push back on some other issues.  Some things I've let go, and others I think will always hang around to some extent or another.

Yet, discourse today centres around how ""easy"" women had it. They didn't have a choice in the matter! The ship - built by men. The crew - comprised of mostly men (23 of the crew were female out of a crew of nearly 800). 

And you#re right about war. The reason why they weren't allowed to fight for a long time is because men have always seen women as a liability in those situations. Never mind the fact that women in war have to do double the labour (raise the children AND keep the household going), and are victims of war rape and forced prostitution. 

If men want to better their lot, then they need to start getting angry at other men, not women. We aren't the ones who are signing men up to partake in deadly wars. Women weren't the ones telling men that they couldn't board a lifeboard to get off a sinking ship in the middle of the Atlantic. We didn't make the rules surrounding abortion, custody, spousal support. But they blame us because it's easier to pass the buck somewhere else."

7699,FaeiNightingale,"I actually need gender neutral bathrooms because they're the only restrooms I feel safe in!
I'm sorry to have to disagree, but I look very androgynous. This means that if I go into the women's restroom, I get weird looks and women saying ""are you in the right bathroom?"" Every. Time.
And if I were to go into the mens restroom, I would feel physically unsafe, along side of getting weird looks and comments.
Gender neutral bathrooms are the safest option for me. If you don't like them, then please, just don't use them. Please don't stop others from using them! I need them!

Also, as a frequent user of these facilities, I can tell you that they're usually empty (which makes me feel better tbh). The only people I see in them are parents with their young children. They definitely don't have an unsafe aura, and are actually pretty nice (literally, since they're used less than the other restrooms!)"

7723,RadicalNoel,"Hey! It sounds like you dont know much about this discourse yet, so Ill try and inform you briefly.
Oftentimes, its only the women's restroom thats turned in to the gender neutral room. If its all of the restrooms, then thats even worse. 
Women are assaulted, raped, murdered, etc by men in restrooms very commonly. If restrooms are made unanimously gender neutral, then it would be even easier for men to do that, as a man entering the women's restroom would not be unusual anymore. 
If we want to avoid major crime, then women are oftentimes just plain uncomfortable around men. This can vary from just everyday discomfort to ptsd shock from, as i said, rape. Men are a danger to women so we really need our restrooms to remain ours.
Not looking at all that, let me say that I am gnc and my partner is nonbinary amd we both feel incredibly unsafe around men, them from rape and me from hearing what men do. 
Pls go forth informed on this, Im not telling you how to think but I hope you keep this in mind!!"

7727,RadicalNoel,"No. Single sex spaces are safe spaces for women and children.
A lot of sex crimes happen in bathrooma so we absolutly do not want gender neutral ones which would allow men to easily assault women. Besides that, there is currently a rise in men implanting cameras in bathrooms to spy on women and even post the videos of them relieving themselves online.

If we want to focus away from major crime for a second, most women simply dont feel safe being around men. Pretty much all women know that if they see a man in a place they thought would be full of only women, theyre going to feel totally differently. This can vary from just mild discomfort to PTSD meltdowns. Its not great.

Gender mixed spaces are good when it comes to workshops, career fields, or other social places. Theyre bad when they are for protection, such as women's shelters, bathrooms, or dorms."

7759,RadicalNoel,"Yeah dont worry, I got that youre just trying to get informed. Im happy youre asking questions :)
I absolutly do. If women have bathrooms for themselves, them duh, men should get their own too. Oftentimes, I as a woman see resources in female restrooms with info on what numbers to call in case of domestic abuse/sexual assault. I acnowledged that men assault women in my previous reply, and men totally assault men too. I feel like the LEAST we could do is also pin up these resources in the men's restroom. 
In these cases, places that they could go to that are full of fellow men who are willing to respect them would be super valuable. Male only shelters are something I advocate for big time, since people of both genders need resources specific to their experiences.

The kind of men only spaces that I do not accept, respect, or advocate for are career based or petty comfort based. Petty comfort would be men wanting woman to leave a ""man-cave"" or a poll club or something because she makes the space feel ""soft"" or ""feminine"". To simplify, their prejudice against women in their space is because she makes him feel effeminate, while women's prejudice against men in her space is that he makes her feel unsafe.

The reason people focus on specifying that women need their own space is because women often feel threatened by trans identified men entering their spaces. Theres a sort of catfight between trans activists and women, women's shelters being assaulted with graffiti and having rats nailed to them, and bad woman who disagree with trans activists... going online and having private speeches to advocate for female only spaces.

If I may change the topic to such a thing, trans activism focused on removing the boundaries between the sexes is actually just misogyny. There are certain protections in government ensuring that at least a certain number of seats are reserved for females, and trans identified men, or trans ""women"" have removed many of such protections. To come more on topic, they are also removing the casual protection that bathrooms gave.

Sorry I went a little off topic, I felt that it was relevent enough to warrant being tacked on to this discussion."

I agree with you for the most part, I think that sex differences should be considered and having developed as a male or female doesn't just go away after transitioning. I think gender neutral bathrooms should be installed in conjunction with tradition male and female bathrooms.

I do disagree with you on the safe spaces though. Obviously professional exclusion is not okay but men do act differently when women are around and often times we can't express ourselves in the same way in a co-ed environment.  As someone who spends the majority of his time in female dominated spaces I often find it relaxing just to hang with the guys.

I do not remember there being a backlash against the free mason news. Free masons would NEVER let women into their club.

7837,,So much for their denying trans women keep male privilege. 
7838,turalaradem,"Whoa so the freemasons are saying trans women are men and it's ok because they too are men? If they're about QUEER power how can they not accept trans men and non-binaries?? (Not that a lot are lining up to join I imagine, but they could still alter policy). "

I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but one of the whole things in 1984 is that they insist on Winston saying things that are untrue but also have no bearing on the actual regime (i.e. ""two and two is five""). The reason they insist on getting him to say and start to believe these irrelevant falsehoods is so they know they've gotten control of him and they can make him now believe anything. If I were more of a conspiracy theorist, I would say that ""transwomen are women"" is one of those seemingly irrelevant falsehoods they want to see us repeat just to prove they can control us. "

7860,Feminazcabooby,Why even bother to take this to the SC when we know exactly how the vote is going to go?
7861,TrollToadette,"Exactly.  It means everything, therefore it means nothing.

Landlords in NYC generally care about 2 things only: do you pay your rent on time, and are they getting complaints from neighbors because you are too loud/have too many guests at all hours of the night/are responsible for the roach infestation in the building.  You like to wear a collander on your head while you mop the floor and your 2 girlfriends and 4 boyfriends watch? They don't give a shit, pay the rent on time."
7862,TrollToadette,"The correct answer: no ones perception matters.

The actual answer:  whoever feels most offended is the one whose perception matters"
7863,TrollToadette,"No, thankfully, it's not that bad.  It's not an arrestable offense.

>will fine employers, landlords and service providers up to $250,000 for deliberately addressing individuals by the wrong name or gender pronouns.

Landlords, employers and services providers (the same groups who have to follow anti-discriminatory regulations) can be fined, not jailed, for ""misgendering"".  So NYC is viewing ""misgendering"" someone about the same way they view denying someone an apartment in your building because they are black, gay, etc.  

Still bad, but not as bad as you thought."
7864,TrollToadette,"No.  What they intend it to mean is that if you rent an apartment out to a man who believes he is a woman, and when you address him you say ""Mr."" instead of ""Ms, Miss, Mrs"" then you are committing a hate crime.  

It's not easy to charge someone with a crime for using racial slurs.  Simply calling someone a racial slur is not enough to be jailed.  Free speech does exist, and thats why this law above is not applicable to everyone.  It is limited scope to landlords and others because it is piggy-backing off of anti-discrimination laws that are in place to combat things like racism (for example: it is against the law to deny renting a unit to someone based on their race).  It's dangerous as fuck, though, because it is establishing a precedent that could later be used for laws applying to all citizens.  It could hypothetically become illegal to refer to someone by their wrong gender in the near future, while still legal to use words like n-gger, f-g, etc.  Its crazy"

7871,auklet,"California passed something similar, for nursing homes. I note that both regulations are written with language that tries to exclude an accidental use of the ""wrong pronoun "" - but I don't agree that the government should be wading into this, at all. It's a VERY bad precedent.

7875,TrollToadette,"I certainly am not against bills that prohibit discrimination in housing, they are unfortunately very necessary in this country.  It's the forced language I have an issue with.  If it becomes a crime to call someone by their legal name then wtf have we come to?  If I worked at a skilled nursing facility, looked at the chart of one of the residents I was meant to care for, saw ""Steven Jones"" as the name, then walked in and said ""good morning Mr Jones"", I wouldn't appreciate a fine or any type of penalty because Mr Jones decided he wanted to be called Gloria Johnson instead.  

This is *especially* dumb when it comes to any type of medical facility, and its in pretty direct violation of most hospital codes.  How are they supposed to confirm name of patient on medical band and chart while not offending the person and their pronouns if their legal name isnt their new ""preferred"" name?  If I'm looking at Steven jones' wristband and I ask him to confirm name and date of birth for me and he says ""Gloria"" then we got a problem.  "
