1,DonMelbourne,"Can we get rid of this 'Kings' crap on this sub, please? How do you feel when you read some women want to be called 'Queens'? 

Let's just call ourselves 'Men', and make that mean something."
2,Anrpan2096,We are men. Not kings.
3,Darth_Zounds,The Return of the Kings.
4,Joesatx,"Can we quit the stupid ""king"" sh*t?!  Sounds like RP mgtow1 stuff. I vomit when I hear a woman describe herself as a queen/princess...no different with ""king"". I, you, are not kings. We don't rule people, we don't run governments. Just be ""men"" and stop sounding like we're overcompensating. Real manhood isn't having to puff yourself up. It's quiet confidence. (if it was sarcastic, disregard)"
5,chakamaki,"What is my take for this pic...


(1). A fighter on ground - You tried initially to fight with injustice by being loyal, friendly and courageous... but you realize that society is not meant what you had initially been taught to... 


what I learned “if you are vegan doesn’t mean crocs are vegan too...” 


(2) arrows on shield - people will throw their thoughts and beliefs at you (Incel, pussy, not a real man, small dick...) when you GYOW.... but you have to shield yourself from those useless arrows and fights... 

my learning - choose your fight.. not all fights are worth your time and energy. 


(3) thinking head - while being broken concentrate on why you broke at first place ... what was that mentality that broke you... (being bluepilled, being a simp, being a white knight - I was all of these before GMOW) now I realized my mistakes and learning from it..

My learning - I am able to change my beliefs and accept the reality... 


(4) a foot holding a ground - shows my mentality - I may be attacked and on ground but certainly not defeated.. shows my determination to win again... this man has still has life power baby... 

My learning : Hold your ground. Don’t accept the defeat.. you may be going through tough time but certainly not dead...

(5) My sword in my broken hand - Shows that you (wife & Society) May have broken my hands (took maintenance and my child against my will) but I still has power to lift my sword and fight back...

My learning - I will fight... this time for my self...

Final thought: I may get hit hard but will fight back...  i was the King and I will be KIIINGGGGG you fuckers (society and my wife)...."

26,DonMelbourne,"I've seen the ""MGTOWs are kings!"" crap pop up on MGTOW1 and Youtube comments. It's reverse virtue-signalling, which is just virtue-signalling; just like reverse discrimination is still discrimination. 

MGTOW is a rational decision, based on cost/benefit analysis of marriage and cohabitation. ""We are kings"" is far away from that."

69,Sarm11111,"Once i kept my main room/living room nicely decorated by a buddy wife.  I had kept it up and put all my man things in the basement, like a big screen, my desk, pc ,,you get it.  And I’ll admit it  was to have an area that I could entertain women.  Over time and a few shitty relationships I  started asking myself the tough questions and first was do I really want a women moving in or marriage for that.  I have always had a very low trust factor for women. And without going into it the lack of trust stemmed from some very criminal things by women, that no one would believe.  I wasn’t an INCEL, far from it, but after the “experience” I retreated and stopped dating.  And witnessed other warning signs with friends and coworkers .  So I asked those questions, do I really want to have a wife/women in my life to the extent of bring them home or marrying, and the answer was no, hell no.  So I bought a huge screen, cut a hole in the dinning room table to mount a tv in to play games with friends, decorated my walls with dragon heads, swords , and so on.  So now my man cave is my whole house and I vouknr care less what any women would say, because I’ll probably be pushing them out the door to a cab.and I love my childish dungeon."

Granted, some women have immaculate homes with the latest fashions - their homes look like a magazine shoot. And that's fine, if you like cleaning 2 hours per day or paying someone else to.

I like a reasonably clean, tidy but lived in home.

As for toys, women think all money not spent on them = wasted money.
They think all time not spent on THEIR wants is wasted time.

Golf club - money could be spent on shoes!
Guy night - time could be spent doing HER shit.

Most women see the man in the relationship as a sort of pet, an appendage. SHE is the relationship. He's a mere appendage.

Most guys don't understand this about women and buy into that ""mutuality"" and ""egalitarian this and that"" bullshit."
214,TemporaryImportance4,"Heat issues? That's highly doubtful, considering Ryzens always had their IHS' soldered, not glued using some cheap and terrible termal paste (Intel). No, it's Intel that was known for reaching high temps and being a source of problems in this regard since Haswell well into the release of Zen and Zen+.

Never heard anything about stability issues, unless you mean using 3950X on a A320 chipset motherboard, but that should never be done anyway, to match a top CPU on a low end mobo from 2 generations ago. It only shows that AMD let's you use the same socket for 3-4 generations, instead of forcing you to upgrade a mobo every generation like Intel does.

Don't know much about laptops, but a 7nm node is more power-efficient than a 14nm one, just by using common sense. Thus I doubt in that. Performance wise Intel was also destroyed in Laptops."

218,TemporaryImportance4,"So heat issues are literally few people complaining about it... While the general rule is that Intel always had higher temps for mentioned reasons, much higher TDP now to manage the overclock of 8 cores to 5GHz, due to that archaic 14nm process, but you say that Ryzens have heat issues... lol.

Regarding laptops, that's literally impossible, read about implications of a much lower technological process of the transistors in a semiconductor devices.

What you mean by more stable? You still didn't explained that."
219,perplexedm,"Dude, I'm not saying that 'amd have heat issues'.  There were some legitimate concerns, I showed you one link, there are tons others.  One of the reasons why amd didn't become a hit all over.  And since you are going so naive about that history:

AMD's Ryzen Pro is doing double duty as a processor and house heater  https://www.pcgamer.com/amds-ryzen-pro-is-doing-double-duty-as-a-processor-and-house-heater/

Am not against amd, rather support them by purchasing gpus, etc. occasionally.  However, not ignorant to concerns.  May be things changed a lot these days.

btw, I'm open to hear about OP's concerns, if they were valid, not here to 'argue' but all ears to listen."
220,TemporaryImportance4,"You are completely clueless about any subject and aspect regarding CPUs, yet you throw some random and overexaggerated claims/accusations over AMD/Ryzen, which in reality happen to be literally individual and very rare occurances. Trust me, if a company like Intel or AMD produces millions of their products there are always going to happen a singular defect within those products, there is no point in claiming in such scenario that entire product's lineup has that issue in most of cases.

For me it is very clear that your knowledge about processors is close to zero. When you asked him, what is wrong with Ryzens and I responded for him, telling you some of it's main pros, you didn't wanted to appear as a person, who has no knowledge about it, so you thrown few random claims, so you could pretend to be a knowledgable individual, but now it's obvious that you have no idea about what you are talking. Now you are stuck trying so hard defending those stupid and false claims, fight for that e-image you care so much about, looool.

I am not gonna waste more time on you, stay mad. :)"
221,perplexedm,"Found the fanboi.

For all concerns raised by my posts, I provided very valid response from industry itself.  Concerning amd cpu heating issue which so rampant, that somebody ran house heating industry on that.  So, it is not some random issue, it was well known.

I'll fully accept the fact the amd cpu may be performing more power efficiently now, but denying concerns will not be right.

Much of your post in only emotional rant, except few cpu info which is common knowledge to almost everyone on internet.  Not into emotionally volatile fanboism into anything.  So, bye."

The next 9 months we spent having sex. It was so much better having sex outside of being in a relationship than being in one. I'm 39 now and at the time I was 29, she was 33 I think with a 4 year old kid. I told her at the time I wasn't looking to be a dad to her kid. Maybe you will have a similar experience. I used to want to be in a relationship yet after approaching a lot of women PUA style for the last couple of years and hooking up with 18 different girls in about a span of a year in a half I started to value my alone time. Now I'm in some sort of monk/hermit mode working to get my shit together. I'm a single dad with an 8 year old son so now it's all about me, him, finances, business, getting my ass in shape and working on getting my CCNA at the moment.

That combined with pregnancy scares, I can’t break up with her until I know she’s not pregnant because then she is still in my life and our relationship is just that much harder, so I should wait. Then on top of that mental issues, I can’t break up with her because that is just gonna drive her over the edge and she’s gonna kill herself or she’s gonna lose her job or whatever.

That all adds up to I can’t just leave her, I should wait things are gonna be ok, if I just love her enough if I just provide enough she will be happy and then we can be happy.
But this morning her parents found another guy in her bed. A “friend” from her childhood I guess. And on top of that last night I was texting her then she “went to bed early” and did that shit where I said goodnight and that I loved her, and she replied with k night. So I knew something was up but I didn’t want to get into it with her so I just turned my phone off for the night, because I expected that she was gonna try and text me and dump some shit on me and I didn’t need that last night.

314,GlobalAsshat,"Women want men that can be playful and non judgemental with them like when they were little kids except with rough and dirty sex.  This infuses them with feel good emotions. A lot of men don't understand this or don't have playful and dominant personalities. They are boring, serious, or too nice and/or needy. This turns women off. Its the basis for the red pill should a man choose to work on himself. The last thing a man should do is allow himself to be used or disrespected by his woman. You have to have a cocky, playful response to shit testing. If you are not good at this, don't get into a LTR.

There's a saying about a partner dying before the other one got sick of them so they're always remembered in a positive light.  Casual relationships work because they infuse women with that sense of newness they crave biologically. Also these men are typically more fun and dominant than the betas they end up in LTR with.

I used to worry about this from my now ex-wife (3 kids and tens of thousands in alimony and child support later) back when we were first dating. A woman will not kill herself over a man. I mean, I'm not saying it has never happened, but it's extremely rare. I think men think that is more common than it is because we project our way of thinking on to them. A man killing himself over a woman is much, much more likely."

I’m sure you’re a good looking guy. I’ve learned that being indifferent to relationships drives girls crazy. If you can turn down a good looking girl and be nice and sincere about it, it’ll drive them **insane**.

357,alevtinalev,Good starting point to getting yourself on a path to find more and better success. I’m proud of you brother.
358,Kurt751990,I think you're a troll. Go learn a skill and go start a job that's worth doing.
359,jde1126,"I don’t mean to sound like someone from r/MGTOW... but

Wow! You have a job like everyone else now, do you want a fucking cookie? 

Keep your head up, drop the toxic people in your life, and try to find what took you so long, and fix that, your life is going to be miserable if you keep holding yourself back. Good luck m8."
360,haagendaas,Dude you look fine. Anyone hating on the pose you did is probably just homophobic. Keep going my man:)
361,durzashade22797,Lmao absolutely not. I don't think i could handle that stress of a political party trying to dig up every inch of my past life in an effort to tear me down. Plus the responsibility of me just getting a job before was daunting enough
362,JD-Anderson,"True on this, more people hate men going their own way than like us.  But I’m so glad for you!  Just like a wise man once said, “it doesn’t matter that you got knocked down, it’s only if you get back up”.

Now I probably butchered that saying, so I’m sorry."
363,thenotoriousdougie,"Yeah, there’s something to be said for keeping your mug shot off of all social media. Can you imagine the repercussions down the road for all the attention whores, Tinder thots , etc for the shit they’ve posted which has already been archived and will sooner or later be databased and searchable using any parameters you can imagine, including facial recognition software, as well as shit that hasn’t even been imagined yet?? Keep that shit under the radar."
364,NakedValhallaBoyyy,"I disagree with this sentiment, I saw a lot of people making it on that last thread but for men's day I posted a group photo of me and all my friends and everyone was into it. I think people just judged him harshly because of his appearance and mannerisms."
365,durzashade22797,Thank You :)
366,durzashade22797,My personality and demeanor has always been pretty feminine to an extent. Even my voice to where I get called ma'am by customers over the phone. But ive kinda embraced that and I don't think anymore that being feminine really makes me any less of a man if you understand

377,mysomethingthaccount,"Doesn't really matter. If you have a drivers license, passport etc they have a photo of you and could use it to identify many more pictures of you on security cameras as you just go about your life. If you have a phone with a front facing camera it can see you every time you use the phone. It's too late to escape this now. Your face is on record and it will be abused."
378,HurtinSteve,Some day he will have an opportunity that is dashed because he posted in a mgtow group and now he is branded as a hater.
379,AbominableSnowDog,"Heck yeah dude! You're who you choose to be. This sub is for men who realise the hypocrisy in women and build their own future. Not misogyny.

Those trashtalkers not only missed the agenda of this sub but are assholes for criticising you like that."
380,NakedValhallaBoyyy,"I was a bit surprised just how upset they got over that sort of thing. I understand why they got upset, but I thought they'd at least fight that instinct with the whole going your own way bit. Not everyone who breaks away from the norm and goes their own way is going to go away they feel is preferred.

You don't need to embrace femininity though. We live in a time that people say you need to accept who you are as if that is unchangeable. I tried to just embrace it when I was a feminist and one day I looked at myself and felt like I was a caricature, that 'leaning into it' was just as much an act as trying to hide it.

There is a similar movement that says we need to accept our bodies as they are, but that isn't true. There are certain parts of you that you shouldn't try to force a change on, aspects that deal with your emotional well being and your happiness. But the way you pose, the way you speak, the words you use, how you dress, those are easily  changed things and more than one path can make you happy. These aren't 'who you are'.  These are just the cosmetics of behavior, things that can be easily changed to suit who you want to become."
381,Erwinblackthorn,"Don't go to college unless you want to be a good employee for the rest of your life, plus debt.

What is your dream business?"
382,Folwart,"Do you have a specific goal for college? If you don't, make sure you have one before you go otherwise the probability of it being a waste increases exponentially. Depending on your skill set and preferences, the trades are a good option. Honestly, outside of the STEM fields I wouldn't recommend a degree."
383,TripForget,It wasn’t your face it was the pose
384,drago8452,"ok, thanks for clarification.
I delivered pizzas in high school.  That was a fun job.  Sometimes I think about going back."
385,haagendaas,"Ah yes, the old “snowflake” to everyone you don’t like. Dude, clearly the guy had a few feminine qualities. That doesn’t make him any lesser than you."
386,haagendaas,"Not really, we should be proud of his accomplishments."
387,haagendaas,"Is this supposed to be a joke? If so, it’s not a very good one."
388,NakedValhallaBoyyy,"How? Genuinely, how? What are the odds that some big employer can find that particular post / photo without already knowing that your reddit account is associated with MGTOW?"
389,durzashade22797,"Tbh my dream atm is to pursue a career of music or acting. Pretty generic I know, and a 1 in a billion chance of success, but these have always been things I loved to do, and I'd at least like to learn all I can about them if not make a career out of it."
390,dogwoodcat,Unless it's med school or nursing. Male nurses are always in demand and make bank.
391,kagewolf,What was wrong with the pose? Internet connection is shit right now so I can’t look it up myself.
392,whotfleap,I never said anything about disliking you. You're just reminding me of every other snowflake I see on the internet. Yeah he might have some feminine qualities but nobody is being homophobic to him. People toss phobias around to freely.
393,GremlinDotKill,"We are talking about the pose, the bleached hair, the wrist flick, you are just looking to be relevant."
394,asianduckpinoydog,No joke. You don't criticise someone who is afraid of snakes as being less than human...why do people discriminate against people who have a natural aversion to homosexuality? But I can't criticize you because perhaps you are naturally homophobephobic or more likely heterophobic...I understand you
395,,[deleted]
396,ThereIsAlwaysVanilla,"Then you are set. Make and save loot at Dominoe's and live cheap while you pursue your goals. In your postition, I'd choose music because you can put it out online for practically free and maybe you'll get a following. Music is practically post-scarcity nowadays. 

Acting might be tougher. That's still a gatekeeper industry and you'll have to try to break into ivory towers and whatnot. As for music, no one can silence you with the tools you have at your disposal today. Keep on rockin' in the clown world!"
397,Folwart,"Very true, medicine is included in STEM."
398,TripForget,It looked like one of those “cute” poses girls try to do on Social media
399,haagendaas,"Agreed, my bad for tossing the “homophobia” thing around. I guess I’m just being influenced and now it happens every now and again. Sorry, I didn’t mean my original comment."
400,haagendaas,"That I am, nice catch. But honestly, he didn’t look too bad."
401,haagendaas,"Because there’s a clear difference between homosexuality and snakes. 1. Homosexuals are the same species as you. 2. Homosexuality does not bite you. 3. I’m not saying you’re less than human, but your morals are iffy at best. 4. I’m neither “homophobephobic” nor heterophobic. Your flaw in this argument is that you can choose to be homophobic, but I cannot chose whether to be homosexual or not."
402,NakedValhallaBoyyy,What? you think that their future employers are going to back track your IP address to the one you had years ago and go through your entire internet history focusing on reddit but not your porn?
403,whotfleap,You're a cool dude for admitting that you're wrong. Need more people like you
404,jde1126,"People who are sensitive are snowflakes.

You jumped to homophobia way too fast pop, we find it repulsive, that doesn’t make us homophobic.

A gay man looks at a vagina, he cringes, that’s not sexism, that’s fucking genetics/natural reaction."
405,GremlinDotKill,Now you are being pathetic as well.
406,,[deleted]
407,haagendaas,"There’s a difference between a vagina and a regular feminine dude, is there not?"
408,haagendaas,Ya got me

The dude had to pay an obscene amount of Alimony after divorce and she won't remarry because she wants to keep the obscene amount of free money rolling in. So her new lucky boyfriend also benefits and they take vacations together off of this poor saps dime. The world is unfair"

440,BadDad01234,"This is someone telling a story of someone telling a story so of course take it with a grain of salt but from what I remember this is California. They had a long term marriage, the wife shacked up with a younger man and they divorced. The alimony was set for life. Meaning as long as she didn't work or remarry she'd require alimony. Or one of them died then alimony  payment requirements would end. And from the looks of it, California court CAN do this. So to quote Joe Rogan: ""it's entirely possible""

479,theCard5,"Am I the only one who saw this movie as WOKE? These men were soy boys. They would have never survived the war. Get the German some water, he is thirsty, SHHHH, no don't shoot. OH, I have milk for your baby. Are you kidding me?  Plus what was with all the storm trooper German shooters. Holy crap. The sniper must have been like a hundred feet away with a clear shot, multiple shots. This movie was a joke. You remember the translator from Saving Private Ryan (good movie), that guy is what these two characters were. No toxic masculinity here. Just feminine qualities .

There is more I didn't like, but I ranted enough."

My Great Grandfather was at the Somme made it across to the other side, drank wine they found in a farmhouse, retreated back as no support and German counter attack imminent, lost a stripe and got number 1 field punishment. Was at Gallipoli and at the end ended up in Ireland when the uprising started. Was an engineer at the front from the start to the end of the war. Told my father many tales... piles of body parts. How the Anazacs wouldn't salute the British officers, how he got lucky when a shell obliterated all the men near him. The screams from no mans land during the night. How he was angry that in the 1930s depression ex soliders were literally left to die on the streets, how poppy day proceeds were given in greater amounts to widows of officers than ordinary soldiers."

The detail on the Albatross fighter was excellent but the scene with the german pilot was over the top bullshit.   No way a German pilot in WW1 would have done that.    Much more likely the other way around, after all the allied troops were getting strafed by these german pilots so they had quite a bit of anger built up."

It took a while scrolling down the list to find someone who agreed with me.  Those Germans were worse shots than the storm troopers. And they were always alone.

532,sean_lx,"I think reddit needs to come out with a “public warning” on subreddits that let’s the subreddits users know that it is violating its policy, give it a few strikes before a quarantine takes place. That way maybe more corrective action can take place. Quarantines should be temporary depending on the circumstances as well. 

I understand that many MGTOW people have far right views.. but there are legitimate issues that men face today (as there are with women) that have discouraged them into relationships and so fourth. 

Personally, I see courts bias  (child custody/divorce), state laws bias, a need for mandatory paternity test at a child’s birth and cultural expectations that reduce men’s equalities in some areas. These I believe, are legitimate and noteworthy concerns.. I don’t understand why instead of a actual debate of these issues, that I ought to be labeled an “incel” or some other derogatory name.

Hopefully freedom of thoughts, expression and speech prevail on reddit. And if not, perhaps a non-profit version of reddit can be developed that is self funded through its users that donate to keep it running. (Like Wikipedia)"

https://fortune.com/2019/02/08/reddit-is-blocked-in-china-but-may-land-a-massive-investment-from-tencent/

Their lack of action to outright calls to violence from the Socialists and Communists on reddit and failure to equally enforce the rules/TOS are a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the requirements of 47 U.S.C. § 230. 

Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco and thus must abide by US laws. It isn't in their Terms of Service or rules that they are acting as a Chinese State Actor, thus they are conducting fraud against US Citizens. 

This censorship of US citizens is a violation of their First Amendment rights and private company or not, they operate a social media company on US soil. In the 2017 US Supreme Court case, 2017 Packingham vs NC, the Court stated that social media companies and cyberspace are the modern public square for discussing and disseminating ideas and this First Amendment protections apply.

Reddit acting as a state actor of China and censoring, banning, shadowbanning, or deleting US Citizens posts or quarantining communities is National Origin Discrimination pursuant to 42 USC § 2000a. US citizens and Patriot's have a right to free enterprise even on social media and it is a violation of US Federal Law to discriminate based on their National Origin, even Patriotic Americans whose pride and beliefs including gender roles and outright opposition to systematic Misandry prevalent in modern western society you may not share. 

Please copy and share this everywhere. Feel free to improve upon it which better research as I am not a lawyer. Mods should really add it or a version of it to the bot post at the top of every thread.

622,fmanly,"Yeah, I had seen the same thing. It is just quarantined.  Here is the behavior I saw:

1.  The sub disappeared from my list of subscribed subs.
2.  The sub's content disappeared from my front page.

I then navigated to reddit.com/r/MGTOW directly, and got the quarantine warning.  Once I acknowledged it I was brought to the sub.

At that point the MGTOW sub STILL doesn't appear in my list of subscribed subs, but now the articles do show up in my front page feed alongside other subs.

Bottom line is that with quarantine they are trying to get people who aren't actively visiting the sub to forget that it exists, and taking subtle measures to try to decrease the popularity of the sub, without outright banning it.  I suspect they have statistical data that the measures they're taking lower traffic over the long term, otherwise they wouldn't be stopping at what they're doing.  

I believe it also makes it less likely to show up in search results.  The goal is probably so that when guys type in the search bar ""does anybody else think marriage isn't worth it?"" or something similarly general they don't get pointed at MGTOW subs.  If they haven't heard of MGTOW already the goal is that they don't hear about it.

I'm skeptical that this sort of thing will do much in the case of MGTOW.  The trends that are driving men to go their own way are so large that it is going to be almost impossible to stop this without making big changes in how society works.

i was so sick of people just being blatantly sexist on their with their old, shitty, boomer facebook memes and everyone in the sub just eating it up. honestly glad it got quarantined"
649,MrJugsMcBulge,"There was always a bit of that in the sub, but it got a LOT worse once the Incel sub was banned.  Also didn’t help that TFM and other content creators embraced the “WAHMEN ARE ALL STUPID WHORES” incel faction."
650,Americanpewdiepie,Can you be more specific ?
651,SmexyCucumber,"And yet, the women over at r/pinkpillfeminism are constantly bashing men 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, yet that's OK or the exception because vagina, right?"
652,SmexyCucumber,"I'm not saying that either is right. But women need to stop being treated like babies. They're grown ups whether they act like one or not. It's unfair on the men who lost their MGTOW sub, when the women over there are given free reign to rag on men unchecked. Double standards aren't cool. Unfortunately, I doubt something will ever happen about that sub because they're women and society won't see under their facade. They can do no evil, right?"
653,Impossible-asset,"I disagree. This sub is geared to help you move forward. 

This is a place to put your money where your mouth is. 

You a mgtow? Ok. Put up or shut up. Post it. What are you doing with your freedom from women and the societal laws that aim to tap your resources and use you as a battery?

You making money? Getting healthy and staying fit? Out for a 3 week hike in the mountains with your dog? Travelling europe maybe? Or just enjoying a peaceful evening of quiet in a home you own (or even built?)?   

A lot of redpill subs provide a space for whinging about what made you angry. This sub is for you to show ""where are you going, now that you're going your own way?""

This sub is for looking forward, not backward."
654,rojhalat,Exactly. People saying don’t tell other men about the women that made you go mgtow are just trying to kill mgtow.

There is a user on there I won't post his reddit screen name but he is literally all over it. Anytime there is anything said on there he says women only want money. This is guy is clearly rich but it seems his money is driving him mad. It is almost pavlovian as well as boring and annoying. He seems to be in denial that women want anything else in the world other than money. I can think of a lot of things they want that aren't about money (but probably require it- but hey thats how we are all enslaved if money didn't exist we would be murdering each other ). If you go on there and you don't know who I am talking about you will. Except oh you are banned!

If you’re talking about n19Coronavirus, it is NOT a flu and it is not 33% mortality. It’s not even 33% serious. Current numbers suggest about 85% mild illness, 15% serious illness (which is very high), and 2-4% mortality within Wuhan (overwhelmed medical system) with mortality 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower outside of Wuhan, where more ICU beds are available.

Good overall summaries for non-healthcare people

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/
About 2% based on *known* cases. There are certainly many cases so mild that they do not come to the attention of health care. The vast majority of those severely affected and dying are elderly, ill, or otherwise immunocompromised. Last I heard, no one under 15 had died (unlike influenza, which kills many children every year). 

Now, how about you provide your sources for the conspiracy claim that it’s a bioweapon (note that I don’t take YouTube or shock jocks as ‘sources,’ and I’d prefer valid medical sources), and that everyone is going to die and civilization will fall?

Think about the torrent wars 20 years ago.  Imagine instead of shutting down napster/etc the RIAA managed to find a way to throttle it so that downloads worked, but were painfully slow.  If they found the right balance then a lot of people would have stuck with it due to the effort required to create something new, and then the painful experience would have helped reduce the number of people pirating content.  Instead they used a sledgehammer and shut everything down, and thus there was a huge void and somebody created a new technology to fill the void. Then because there was no competition, everybody rapidly adopted the new technology.  If there was instead competition between the legacy technology that had a painful experience but an extensive library of content, and a new technology that was better which nobody actually used yet, then that would have fragmented the community and slowed adoption.

I think that is the goal here.  Don't scatter the roaches.  Instead get them to huddle up while the oxygen is slowly removed from the compartment.  Plus you get less outrage because it isn't a complete ban."

And I'm responding to many more posts and comments with ""distinguished"" because I want to remove any doubt...... this sub is NOT a mgtow1 refugee camp.

This is for the men who are moving forward, not left behind.

764,csehszlovakze,"> what do you mean by ‘Run its course’?

I mean that if you get infected, you either defeat the virus or die from it, given enough time. Most of the lamestream media only tracks how many people get infected and how many die on a day, they don't track the infected ones whether they can fight it off or die from it on longer time periods.

It's like marriage and divorce stats. The state gives you how many marriages and divorces happened in X year, and the _crude divorce rate_ is simply calculated from these two numbers. They don't track individual marriages to find out if a spouse died or they got divorced after 45 years."

802,jcar99,idk I was just sick of all the bullshit. The sub completely steered away from its intended purpose and was just all around a mess
803,Impossible-asset,"You're entitled to your opinion. But that makes me laugh. You're coming over from mgtow1 where you can be banned instantly with no reason given. Where the rules are written so hap-hazardly that any post you make could be construed as breaking one of them, which catches you a ban....  but yeah, the rules here are ""authoritarian censorship""... no. 

And you have the entire rest of the red pill sub reddits to post what you like. 

And yes, this is not a free-speech sub. It does have a narrower view. And the rules are not complex at all. ""Focus on yourself, not women, dont post low effort memes, dont be a nazi, be civil, dont trash talk other subs and put a synopsis on youtube links so we know it's not spam.""  .... that's as mgtow as it gets and if you're one of those ""mgtow means do whatever I want and have no purpose but shit posts and projecting my anger about women"" types, well then nobody is forcing you to be here, are they?

If your idea of ""going your own way"" is complaining about women, then this probably isnt the sub for you.

That’s clearly bullshit, I can’t even remember how many cases of unarmed black men being shot by the police I’ve heard, given how often they’ve happened. 

Before you start claiming white people are oppressed, look at the justice system. Black men getting sentences muuuuch longer and severe than white men ALL the time.

Except that is far from the only rules as published in your side bar,  if those where they only rules I may not have a huge problem with them.  Personally the rules I find most objectionable and subjective is the ""effort and quality"" rule,  ""civility"" rule, and ""relevance"", all of which are WIDELY subjective

Then there is of course the rule about ""No denigrating other subs for the quality of their content."" which is routinely violated when it some to talking about MGTOW1  and other subreddits you dislike which is amusing given your complaints about how MGTOW1 is moderated, a complaint I disagree with having seen nor had any issues with the moderation there.

>If your idea of ""going your own way"" is complaining about women, then this probably isnt the sub for you. 

While my idea is MGTOW is not complaining about women,  I left my rage phase well over 20 years ago.  I have been MGTOW for longer than MGTOW has been a thing on the internet,  and longer than many on this subreddit have been alive.  

However this subreddit seem to be more about Physical ""success"",  believing that the ""true path to MGTOW"" is body building gym rat shit.  I have no interest in that.  I pursue wealth building, FIRE, intellectual interests,  not dieting and exercise which seems to be focus of this place,  so you are likely correct this is not the subreddit for me

And trash talking other subs: yeah, people coming here and posting about how other subs suck, are infiltrated or compromised or cucks or blah blah blah blah. 

I mention the moderating habits of mgtow1 because it's relevant to this exchange as I'm expounding on the sub reddit rules for you. There are different moderating habits for that sub than there are here. For example, you havent been banned here for questioning the mods. Try that on other red pill subs and see how far that gets you. 

You may object to the content here. You may object to the rules and how they are enforced. Id refer you to the banned from mgtow mega thread to get a good idea from people who have had dealings with the moderation practices there.

828,SavageChessMaster,"Nice job with the name calling, you definitely proved you’re an asshole incapable of having an argument while remaining civil. 

What you said about repeat offenders is your assumption, which isn’t true. Look at how many years somebody gets for selling or using cocaine vs crack cocaine. There’s a different in sentencing. Why? Because white people are usually the ones using cocaine while blacks use crack. Totally not racist right? Again, Brock Turner got released from prison because he was a “good athlete”, bet you the judge would have never thought of that had he been black. 

Also, yes, black people tend to have more criminal history than other races, but also because of the racist history our country has of keeping them under poverty. Banks wouldn’t loan blacks money for the housing market until very recently, 80’s or 90’s, something like that. Anyway my point here is that while not justifying it, it’s logical to believe a large group under poverty will do anything to survive, including crime. Then, you add the fact that job applications discriminate people based off their criminal history, and you get the high % of recidivism that the articles talked about. Not many opportunities + poverty + not allowing people to integrate back to society = perpetual criminal records."
829,SirYouAreIncorrect,"> For example, you havent been banned here for questioning the mods. Try that on other red pill subs and see how far that gets you. 

I have on MGTOW,  I was not banned. MGTOW and MenRights are the only to men subreddits I post to,  the others do not interest me.  

I challenge mods all the time in Subreddits,  sometimes I am banned most times I am not.  I have challenges mods in MensRights, MGTOW, KIA, KIA2, and several others

I do not fear bans,  reddit to me a time suck,  something to do when I am bored.  I express myself if people want to ban me for that well that is their problem not mind.  Being a closed minded fool generally results in a shitty life. 

>But I'm not changing any of this sub because you disapprove

I am not asking you to,  I was simply pointing out the hypocrisy and bullshit.  I never had any expectation that my words would result in any changes. 

Subreddits like this never really grow beyond  a few thousands members because of the massive limitations on what can be talked about.  That can be a good thing, close knit communities can be good.  Sucks for a movement,  sucks if you are trying to bring actual awareness to what MGTOW is and how it can save men, but...

I browse MGTOW and MenRights in the hope that I can help a man cope with what is happening to him in his life,  this is why I am not put off by the posts in MGTOW1,  I want to help those men move past that rage on to something better.  You want to reject them and isolate them.  Different paths, different goals

>If you dont like them you can move on if you prefer. Nobody forces you to participate here. 

I probably will,  There is not much discussions here that interest me. I like to talk politics,  I like to discuss how the Culture war effects men, how politics effect men,  etc.  This is what I want to discuss,  you ban those discussions so...

833,MyLittlePonyofDoom,Have a nice day? Smiley face for you 😀
834,Allthetoast,"Sorry, but you have your facts quite wrong:

    Turner didn't rape anyone. He was initially charges with 2 counts of rape, 2 counts of fingering (foreplay), and one count of intent (erection). He was not convicted of rape; the prosecutor had to drop the two counts of rape early on, due to complete lack of evidence. Turner was convicted of the two counts of drunken foreplay and one count of probable erection.

    The two counts of rape were dropped because he didn't take out his penis, much less put it in anyone.

    The two counts of sexual assault did indeed involve his fingers - in drunken foreplay, to which the girl had consented thrice. Her consent was never disproved, nor was it ever disproved that her passing out occurred after the fingering.

    In other words, she was never proved unconscious during the fingering. Thus your statement is again in error.

    The conviction of intent had as sole basis an officer's speculation that a ""cylindrical"" appearance under Turner's pants, was an erection. (Considering many young men get an erection just looking at a woman, were an erection proof of intent to rape, much of humanity would be in gaol.)

    The foregoing are all mitigating circumstances or outright grounds for acquittal. Terming them ""excuses"" is an ethical crime; every judge and jury are required to consider such mitigating or exculpatory facts.

    Additional ""excuses"" - strongly mitigating material - are the 39 letters legitimately addressed to the judge as part of the sentencing process, from both males and females who had known him his whole life, attesting to their belief that he had not a malicious bone in his body, and any offence given was in their belief purely unintentional, in alcoholic stupor."

They all neglected to mention the poor woman broke her arm when the dog attacked her, so she was in shock and unable to fight the dog. Luckily, a man was there to step in and save the child. He motioned for her to get help while he dealt with the dog.

Everyone in the thread ignored this part of the story, even when other people were posting links to the news article explaining the circumstances. The comments were disgusting, and not at all about GYOW.

Which made me think, What do we have to contribute to a relationship as men? Perhaps money, but what else?

It wasn't concern trolling it was a genuine question that wasn't just about everyone else, but about me as well. What do I really offer in a relationship?  A lot of people freaked out in the comments, kept insisting they have 'love, loyalty,' those vague intangible things a girl would say as well.

But some of them made a really great point: men are a human shield. We are expected to lay down our lives to protect a woman, even if we aren't dating her. If we are just walking down the same alley as a woman and someone comes after her, we are expected to put ourselves between her and the attacker.

870,UnfunnyName22,"Things Are Getting Out Of Hand (repost) (got banned from MGTOW for this statement)

Both MGTOW and feminism are at each other's throats like cats and rats and I'm getting confused about it all. There's so much hate that both sides have lost sight of what the actual point is. 

I thought we were all for equality, but all I see is women giving advice on how to subjugate a man, or men pushing for dystopian misogynistic ideals. At first, I was completely and utterly fooled by the MGTOW movement (being a man, of course) then after going through all the hostility, I see one post about someone climbing a beautiful mountain, achieving satisfaction, and being a better person from the experience. 

When I saw this, and then looked back at all the women slandering comments, I was like Jesus, this guy really knows what MGTOW really is. 

The people in that sub have got it all wrong, sure there IS inequality, but, throwing more fuel in the fire for feminist activists ain't gonna help.

I remember seeing a black man on TED who went to talk to the leader of the KKK himself, (link here -> https://youtu.be/ORp3q1Oaezw) and after so much diplomacy, got him to leave the group. It showed me that if each party respect each other, they'll bond and find trust within each other to work forward towards a common goal.

But with feminism (in it's current state) and MGTOW, it feels like the point is to pull each other apart as much as possible until a breaking point. Sure, there are pretty bad cases out there, but don't you think we should band together for a common purpose to change those laws and make it truly equal?

Both sides, men and women, have lost the point. MGTOW, if they are going their own way, need to cut out the obsession. Feminism and predominately 'feminine' groups such as the female dating advice subreddit, need to stop clearly trying to provoke bitterness between the genders and look for a common ground to start building good relationships with men over.

To me, MGTOW was about internalising the rational male principles and choosing not to go along with it, Not trying to change human nature by shaming and hating on people.

885,livingstranger,"Got banned months ago for calling someone out on their decision to celebrate going his own way by taking sometime else's life away from them. 

I still visit regularly but can't post anything. I explained to the mod my rationale and that I was mgtow but got no response."
886,FatalArchon,"The official mgtow Reddit has been quarantined / banned by the platform. I wasn't banned, but seeing the libtard direction that community has been going... Well deserved.  I'm looking on here and I see all the people that got banned by MGTOW's censorship, looks like the censors have been censored! Excellent karma! HAHAHA"
887,_Mecc_,I don't know why I got banned probably because I disagreed with some people ( like some women do get raped and we don't live in the worst time ever ) lmao what a joke
888,AmandaHolly,"I got banned for saying that no one should get married without a prenup. I told them about how I refused to marry my ex without a prenup because I’m my parent’s sole heir, and my ex made terrible financial decisions. I told them I agreed with them 🤪"
889,Electronic_Record,I have no idea why I was banned.  All my karma was from posting on MGTOW but after the quarantine I edited a lot of my history to keep from getting doxxed.  Then 2 days ago I was banned and none of the mods will reply to my msgs asking why.
890,hyperaids420,"I got banned for saying that someone was a sexist because they said something incredibly sexist

Basically said women are objects and should stay in the house unless they’ll get slapped

Which is a pretty dickish thing to say"
891,thotless_rat_bastard,"I was banned for posting this; 

I'm going to get downvoted, but I think it needs to be said.

There are many people here in the rage stage, and some incels that have moved to a new home, and that's okay, but it's not a place where you get to bitch, ad infinitum. At least it wasn't before at 60k.

Breathe. You're not dead yet."
892,KOTORbayani,"Banned for calling it was it was, an incel sub. Hopefully this sub stays the course and doesn’t degenerate into a sweaty neck beard fest."
893,ValhallaBoundBoy,"Someone had posted the very platitude driven kind of 'it gets better', and I argued against it. So I got banned. This man was saying that people who missed their kids the wives had stolen could solve it just by going shopping at the mall on Christmas. I wasn't even rude. For many men it doesn't get better, particularly if the child died instead of just being taken away."
894,pmmemonay,"Not banned, just got a wall of text with insults because I mentioned I used to have single moms as booty calls. Surprise, surprise, I got 12 ""MGTOW"" occurrences on his first page of his history. I think it is funny how easily triggered some of these guys are."
895,SalvageProbe,I used incel lingo to troll the incel who posted a racially aware blackpill comic misguidingly attacking MGTOW (though the comic is really aimed at TRP or rather PUA).
896,GreetingsFromErf,"I haven't been banned there, but I do notice a large number of posts that get deleted by the mods.  To me they don't seem to violate any rules but they get deleted anyway."
897,schroedinger11,I put a sarcastic comment there and I was banned.
898,Itried1_1,"I posted a wholesome thing that was basically saying:
""Don't attack others for what someone else has done to you.""
Yeah, instant ban."
899,MisanthropeArtichoke,"I guess I have to join the club. The comment for which I was apparently banned related to a female astronaut collapsing during a press conference. The assertion made was that the collapse is proof that woman shouldn't be astronauts. 

My reply: ""Eh, I'd be leery of making assumptions. Maybe she's sick. Maybe her blood sugar was too low. There are a lot of explanations for a collapse. Maybe the stress of space travel, lack of gravity and whatnot, acts different on a woman's body. Who knows. 

Just because one female astronaut collapsed doesn't necessarily say anything whatever about female astronauts in general.""

That comment is apparently deserving of a permanent ban from mgtow1. I will update if the mods respond to my DM."
900,silversorcerer1981,"There’s a comic strip of Superman carrying Lois Lane in a skirt where someone commented: ‘back when women dressed like women and wore skirt’

901,SirScotalot88,"Jokingly called a kid Chad that posted a pic of himself posing on a motorcycle after his break up. It was obviously a joke as he was good looking, but that's all it took to get me banned.

907,JeznaKreatura,Why is it that subs like r/pinkpillfeminism dont get banned?
908,Aladdin70,Just got banned for downvoting a couple of nasty posts against female homeless .. and some other low effort female bashing. it's pretty funny how you can be a member of a group for months and the moment you say something against them you're gone.
909,RadThaddeus,Simps and manginas at it again. Ahh reddit...run by fags and dumb asses lol
910,marcopoloram,i am not banned but the community doesn't show up in search and it says the community is quarantined.
911,Dinomiteblast,"Just got banned for telling someone ( who was calling anti male subs echo chambers ) to be careful that r/mgtow might become the same. 

I dont know, as i never got an explanation. So i asked if r/mgtow was r/feminism. No answer.

I guess it became a self fulfilling profecy as i dont like hypocrites and try to have integrity. Calling out others shitty behaviour and not have integrity is a no no in my book."
912,ilovehelmetsama,"Got banned a while ago. From what I remember, it was from pushing back against someone saying that monk mode is the only way to go. 

I like fucking women. Apparently that’s a bannable offence."
913,kittynovalove,"I got banned for pointing out hypocrisy. It’s cool if you want to go your own way. But I don’t like extremists from either end whether you’re a feminist or a MGTOW. The whole “All women are the same we know everything about them and their con artist nature.” Is no different than women claiming “All men are the same we know everything about their rape craving nature.” I like the main idea such as pointing out legitimate systemic oppression such as inequality in family court and little to no help with domestic violence towards men. But to paint all women as bad and to attack the women that agree with you and to attack women such as Daisy Cousins who have nothing to gain for pointing out double standards, it makes you look like an immature like Undead Chronic who just mainly insults. I’m pretty sure that’s why he gets banned a lot as opposed to other MGTOW channels that are A LOT more civil. I find the “We don’t hate women, you feminist!” immediately followed up with “Fuck off cunt! Why are you, a woman here?!?!” Hilarious. They’re sinking themselves.

And the the whole “Women are bad brother come drink with us!” Sounds like the counter parts to the bitter divorced woman club that hates men and can’t just live their lives out to be happy."
914,Adernain,"They tried to attack Greta Thunberg, implying that she is famous because she is a female, compared to males that didn't get so famous, and so I tried to correct them. Guess who got banned"
915,Prof_Punk,"I think I got banned because I admitted to being  a trans male. I never posted and I only ever commented that one thing so now I’m banned from participating. The message didn’t say why I was banned, it just said that I was."
916,Ruffianthydog,"I was banned for simply stating that man should focus on they money, rebuilding they credit & to forget these feminist thots for 2020. I personally think it's ridiculous to get banned for that. I did reach out to the moderator via email but no reply I SAID PHUCK IT! TOO MANY FEMININE MEN ON THAT PANEL PRETENDING TO BE SOMETHING THEY NOT SO WHATEVER... "" This is not a brotherhood of empowering man like I thought. """

920,attilathehamn,"I said that the reason the new Star Wars movies failed is because Disney doesn't care about producing ""good"" movies, they just want to produce movies that people will pay to see. I'm assuming I was banned for that because I didn't agree that the main character being a female is what ruined it but they never told me why I was banned so we'll never know."

926,some1arguewithme,I still can't believe I was banned. I thought that place was the only safe place on Reddit lol. What kind of hostile takeover is happening over there? Did a woman get mod powers? I know that's how I got banned from men's rights by a woman mod...

946,nomosapiens,"I got banned 18 minutes after posting asking if any of you guys have research articles that corroborate their arguments.

947,antifeminist3,I haven't been banned from /r/MGTOW and I cannot find posts from you guys that would suposedly get you banned.  Can you point to links?
948,shark30k,The first sub where I actually posted. I don't know what was so offensive that I am not able to access it anymore. Maybe I'm banned. No more posting on Reddit now only consuming content.

952,,"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/gyj3yw/how-reddit-is-teaching-young-men-to-hate-women


Why is it always about what the men are doing and how do we stop that? What is it with society wanted to put so many different controls in motion on every level of a man from his dick/circumcision all the way to his psych, to laws of the land marriage/divorce, expectations as far as being provider, protector. What did they think would happen! Are we really just a slave gender that gets rewarded with ""a good life"" unless we screw up? Bummed out."
953,cliffbot,I don't even know why and when I got banned. Suddenly it just says I'm not allowed to view the community anymore. What did I do?
954,LegacyAccountComprom,"To paraphrase I called them incels.

To try and remember it was something like 'you just shit on women, no accountability yourselves...' no I can't even remember. 

I probably tried to sprinkle jq in there too.. Alexa, who owns Mindgeek?"
955,ihnrva,I got banned (i think) for calling one person a shill for women in a thread. I'd been on MGTOW since Oct 2018 never had a problem. I guess Blue pillers have taken over. It's sad. No response from the mods.
956,Cheeky9,Got banned for asking what was happening on their discord and how to apply back (probably not sure). Do you'll think it's worth it to keep subbed to it? For the memes?

962,Adamshifnal,"Ngl are you surprised it's gone? There's some serious people on that thread which talk about the only women they love are prostitutes because they know what they want (Yeah, you're money and they will do anything to get it), fear is the best tool to use to get women's respect (like wtf?)

&#x200B;

I'm all down for MGTOW because a lot of the stories were about some men who just recently went through a horrific divorce and they just wanted some pick me up...and then a solid majority of the posts were just sheer hatred towards women just because of their obscure experiences with women..."
963,shun2311,Was banned because I state there might be a snitch mod in the sub
964,69xSPARKx420uwuXD,I got banned. I told a dude its not a political sub. all you here on there now is snowflake cuck libtard and a gang of trump pics and memes. it's like bro its go your own way not be a little bitch to the establishment and out your needs on anyone. I thought as men we would be able to not have political lines but apparently I'm just a fucking libtard cuck.
965,Silva_Shadow,"As a subscriber to both, I can say that I don't believe many of the negative posts in here about mgtow, because I've not seen that on there, mgtow is literally calling out has behaviour from women and they don't like it.

R/MGTOW has been infiltrated by feminists and women complaining, this place is next because you Simps create divisions instead of just saying the truth, which is no one was breaking the rules in mgtow, no one was inciting hatred, only support and calling women out in their bad behaviour was what it consisted of. Anyone else saying bad things about mgtow is lost likely lying."
966,unknownmgtow,Sounds like women getting hot over these posts and simping is on the rise here. Im out.
967,whotfleap,"There was a post that I replied on saying how if you're not on Nofap you're not a real MGTOW. Got banned from the commenting again. I have come to a conclusion that it's either undercover simp maginas or feminist in this subreddit. And I'm standing by my argument that it you're not on Nofap you're really not MGTOW. No fap should be practiced by everybody in MGTOW, but I guess it's okay to jerk off to a chick that you can never touch. I shouldn't be banned for speaking my mind, that's literally what the community is about.

968,RyansPutter,"Some guy was hawking fleshlights as a way to get over horniness without having to deal with women.  I said that it's possible to have relationships with women without marrying them or engaging in a LTR and called OP an incel because he is.  Not Reddit's ""If you point out sexism against men you are an incel"" definition but the actual definition.  


I'd been lurking there off and on for a while.  But the bullshit's gotten out of hand.  Yeah, there are a lot of shitty women out there, but I'm old enough and experienced enough to recognize red flags and avoid them.  Most of the posters there see fake red flags everywhere.  


Reddit's just an echo chamber.  I remember on an old account I got banned from /r/conservative for calling out anti-Trump conservatives prior to the election.  Then later I got banned from /r/The_Donald for criticizing a couple of Trump's policies.  I got banned from /r/news even though I never posted there.  I got banned from /r/datingoverthirty for going against the grain when there was a ""single moms are so strong"" circlejerk."
969,FaAlt,"I know /r/mgtow got quarantined, but I really hope they don't flood this sub.  This sub is about living your life single, not about complaining about women.  Although the titles are similar, the theme is very different."
970,SceptileSquad,"I have always been intrigued by the philosophy of MGTOW and the main subreddit. I myself am 18, and have an amazing girlfriend who I intend to marry, however I understand why you would not want to get married in today’s modern society. 

I got banned months ago, because I kept seeing misogynistic comments and I kept replying to them pointing out the hate and the sexism. I could view posts but I couldn’t comment and I couldn’t keep looking at all of the misogyny and hate without being able to reply to it. 

I found this sub a few days ago when I learned that the main sub was finally quarantined. This place has little misogyny, and seems way more focused on self improvement, and actually understands treating everyone with kindness and compassion. Just because you don’t want to date and marry women does not mean that all women are hateful, life-destroying feminazis from hell. 

Thank you to all of you respectful MGTOWs out there who are doing the right thing. Women are great. The divorce and court systems are not. Going your own way literally means choosing your own path in life, which means you shouldn’t be criticising others for not following your particular path."

973,Wokchefjosh,"I haven't been banned, because I don't post there. I read their BS sometimes to understand their perspective though. Basically, they just want to have their bitterness/hatred affirmed by other males who feel the same way. It's one big, depressing circle-jerk. It must be a sad life, to go there and engage because it's the only place you feel validated. Pathetic, really.

Then, there's the female version... How many of these places exist?

Edit: These people just needed a friend to tell them...give it time and it'll happen/you will meet someone. I didn't have sex as early as a lot of people. I remember some athletes at 16 and then through high school everybody acted like they were having sex. I'm glad I never got any STDs or had any kids too early for me to handle. I eventually blossomed. Everyone does...except these losers. I wish I could reach them but they're done listening."

Asked EXTREMELY POLITELY what proper steps I could take to remove the ban, as I thoroughly supported the movement of mgtow and punishment for false rape accusers. Never got a response. Low key glad mgtow got quarantined. It was filled with overflow users from r/incels and mods were becoming corrupt.

988,durzashade22797,"Someone posted on the subreddit trashing K-pop groups for wearing makeup on stage calling it the results of women's drive to feminize men and all that BS, calling them Simps and shit. Now I didnt care incredibly much about K-pop I'll admit, but what I did care about, and I felt was worth discussing is the stigma behind makeup itself and masculinity, and how just because someone wears makeup to enhance their features and cover imperfections so they'd feel more confident about themselves doesnt make them less manly or a simp or a fag (a word I saw frequently in the comments) because there are plenty of perfectly good (and straight) dudes who rock a face of natural makeup. It was a stupid argument I'll admit, and I regret getting involved in it, however i dont I deserved a ban. Especially since the way I see it, a man going his own way to feel confident about himself in whatever ways he sees fit whether it be regular gym visits or regular sephora visits without worrying about what other think is a fairly MGTOW concept."
989,the_ultimate_salvaje,"Left a comment on mgtow and got banned

So someone posted a picture of baby yoda saying he was born a mgtow and I explain that there is no such thing only incels are born that way. I explained that Incels love to claim mgtow cause they can’t get women but the women they do they will become a fierce little male feminist and will turn on mgtow. I know this cause I seen it with my own eyes and for saying this I was ban.  Luckily I used a throwaway account but wow I can’t believe that mgtow defends incels as if we are all incels if I wanted to be part of a incel community then I would but then again I can’t cause I’m not ugly or fat or short so I don’t fall under any of those categories. The reason why I’m a mgtow is cause I been with too many women and they are all the same. Incels want to believe they are truly mgtows but are you truly a mgtow if you never even experienced betrayed by a women? Dated one after finding mgtow and realizing that everything said her is true? Maybe is just me. 

Ps don’t ban cause I’m not a fucking incel. I’m a mgtow but not a incel."

I think a lot of foreskin lovers cannot accept different opinions, even though the scientific evidence is overwhelming on the benefits of circumcision. I think  prejudice still pervades because circumcision are common practices for Jews and Muslims and therefore it will always be viewed with biasses. I was banned for my opinion. I suppose the mod must be foreskin lover MGTOW."
992,NotAnotherDingBat,I simply mentioned that most of them have not gone their own way. They’ve replaced dating women and being taken advantage of with using all of their energy with resenting them.

making up rules at your own discretion instead of amending the sub rules; thats some feminine shit right there. probably FGTOWS in disguise or something. or some seriously massive egos, inflated with the sticks up their arses. fuck knows. but im thankful for /r/mgtow2 .

997,Immarrrtal,Got banned for asking about wanting to live life with a kid or two but without a wife. Like wtf MGTOW
998,RIPOldAccountF,I got banned for saying that telling women that they should have kids asap because their best years for statistically having the best chance at healthy offspring is probably not the best idea. That along with welfare(single moms make up 75% of welfare) are contributing to young single moms which lowers the pool of women men would want to date.
999,TheValhallaBoy,"I haveb een banned again. This is my third time. The mod I had reached out to last time suggested I just create a new account so I did, and it's been less than a week, I've only gained 100 karma, and I'm already banned. No idea why. I refused to even get into disagreements this time, but it looks like asking for male only movies and making the title a tongue in cheek 'sexist movie club suggestions' was enough to do it."
1000,TheHentaiEnthusiast,"I recently posted something I seriously needed for my gender equality school report. Since MGTOW supported men, I asked about what the men of that sub thought regarding forced and toxic masculinity, and their personal experiences regarding it. I just asked. That's it. 2 mins later, I got banned - straight after a bunch of dudes flamed the comments, angry at feminists and somehow missing the whole point of the question being for my freaking school report. I'm not sure if anyone else will be willing to share feedback at this point, or also downvote me to hell lmao"
1001,RudiMcBallsweat,I thought why was my feed so pg lately. So some „ People“ decided we were too toxic or what? Gosh darn were alll only gentlemen in here who have enough of woman. It sometimes feels like People think were dangerous because of our un soceieterian beleves...

Is that too hard for you to understand? Most successful people dont like to be told what to do . The site claims to be all about men succeeding. But it seems they want psychopaths and dumbfu#ks on their site instead. For some of the cretins on that site, emptying their bowels without it being in their pants is a success.

1013,IHaveAFewQuestions00,They close you get the louder they are...
1014,l0nes0mec0wb0y1306,So MGTOW nowadays is about bitching like a feminist but in opposite direction. What a joke.
1015,MGTOWMODSSUCK,this is exactly where I got my username from; calling out racism on the sub and getting banned.
1016,,"Yeah I got banned for something similar. Someone was insulting the fact that AOC (who I don't even like) is *just a bartender* (which is totally false, she's a congresswoman now) and I said it would be like insulting Trump because he's *just a TV show guy* (which is also false, he's the president now).

Here is the comment:

https://old.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/ekenqp/the_word_men_is_missing_from_this_because_men/fdb5vf4/

TL;DR - there must be a real fag in the MGTOW mod team. I bet he rides a harley too."
1017,AnotherPhilosopher,I think those girls over at /r/mgtow are definitly mods.
1018,MyLittlePonyofDoom,"Yeah I think you’re right. Alt right redditors managed to take over subs by infiltration, somehow banned other mods and poisoned them. Now incels have done the same to r/MGTOW."

1020,csehszlovakze,the #2 mod on the list.
1021,rquasius,How do you tell which moderator banned you?
1022,bhfanatik,"seems like it has become a MAGA sub. Any opinion criticizing Trump is downvoted to the abyss or even banned. They pretend they're going their own way but they fantazise about a conservative society and obssess about ""owning the libs""."
1023,MuleFool42,"Yep. They trigger easily to anything that doesn't conform exactly to their belief system. I don't get it. MGTOW should be for every man to understand as a lifestyle or philosophy to live by if they so choose. Everyone guy will have his own version of MGTOW, it doesn't have to be one-size-fits-all. 

Very limited thinking over there."
1024,Impossible-asset,"You're right. ""Calling attention to"" something =/= hate. 

Here's the rub. It is *easy* to bitch about something that bothers you. It often takes much more introspection and thought to come up with a solution. 

Here, this sub is aimed as representing the positive sides of mgtow. What is can do *for* a man, vs just complaining about women. 

Now, maybe by tightening things up on the posting guidelines, the sub might shrink. I'm good with that if what does get posted is positive and helps men show their accomplishments, or have meaningful discussions focusing on living a full and satisfying life vs complaining about the ""nature of wahmen"" and such. 

Jokes and memes and posts bitching about women have their place, it's just not this sub, and to allow the posts that focus on women or ""calling then out"", just detracts from the goal of this sub."

1034,MuleFool42,"At least you got a response. Most of the time they are scared to say why a person was banned. I was banned after I told someone that hate is a bad thing for many reasons. First, it means that you care and that you're giving power to the other person. It also isn't good to let hate rule your life because it's unhealthy. 

They absolutely couldn't have that, I suppose. I was banned with no explanation because their a bunch of scared little bitches that can't actually admit to their hate or they'll be quarantined. So they won't say anything,just ban people with no explanation."
1035,ownyxie,"I actually got banned without reason. Don’t even know why. I asked, they never answered.

1037,Great_Sandwich,Same for everyone here.  Nobody ever gets an explanation from the mods.
1038,Impossible-asset,"I think you're confusing mgtow with mra's.

Mgtow gives zero shits about any of that. It is what it is and we're perfectly content to walk away from it, and the culture that goes with. 

I have no bitterness towards women or feminists. Their bullshit doesnt stop me from getting laid as I please, without having to compromise my own self-interest, and no risk of sexual harassment or divorce rape.

I just go to other places where the cancer of femenism has not spread. 

If you want to change laws and have some sort of ""come together"" moment, you are in the wrong place. 

We dont care. We're finding our own way to happiness and satisfaction in life. We've figured it out that quite simply, we dont need women. 

Go in peace."
1039,MuleFool42,"They're transphobic, homophobic, sexist, etc......... They can't outright say that but they adhere to hateful ideas pretty firmly, IMO. The thing is, MGTOW can do so much good for men, especially young men, that it doesn't need the bigoted element to be important in a man's life. 

Ultimately, they're giving true MGTOW a bad name."

1049,MuleFool42,"That's terrible. I think women should know about MGTOW and understand why it's important for men to be MGTOW. Not because men and women need to hate each other (we don't), men just need to be aware of how society views them and how to mitigate society's negative influence on their lives. 

Instead, the focus is on hate and negativity. It could be so much better but the mods are children that can't see the big picture."

That will be your best bet even if the judge decides to puss out and award her everything. You’ll still keep all your assets and she can kick rocks if it ever comes to a split."
1055,kryptomancer,"You have a female username and are suggesting marriage as a viable option in a MGTOW forum. That's like going to a Christian forum and saying worshiping Satan is a viable option, you just need to do it right.

In case you didn't know, prenups are non-deterministic and regularly thrown out of court and are not respected, because basically men are not respected. All the woman needs is a good lawyer and you may as well wipe your ass with the paper the prenup was written on. It's like telling a man to wear a kevlar vest in case of getting hit with a round of .50 BMG.

Marriage of any form is not an option for a man, especially when there is zero benefits that can't also be attained outside of marriage anyway. Sex, LTR, children etc... all can be attained outside of marriage in greater amounts and with less costs and much less risk."

1114,Darkspace100,Mgtow is basically an incel sub. Alot of incels flooded the sub when the incel sub got nuked.
1115,Impossible-asset,"I disagree with that assessment. 

You're combining two different things.

Men who desire women but cant ""get"" them are involuntary celibate men aka incels or omega males etc. 

Mgtow men are men who *could* (and in the vast majority of cases, have) had women, and were often married, but have been burned by the courts in a divorce or seen how society supports the word of a woman in judgement versus the evidence given by a man. 

Both men may be angry, but incels *stay* angry.

At your age I was the same, after I got to college, I started to see life as it really is once I got to live on my own.

The only woman great in my life is my mother. She loves me like no woman will ever love me. The other women in my life? They were great as long as I was providing. Men love women and women love children. A woman will never love a man the way he expects it. That's a fact and a sad one. For me at least as I was growing up believing in romantic love.

Many guys on the other mgtow forum, probably bought this idea as well and went through divorce. You say that divorce and court system suck, but think about it: isn't it the women who get bored or whatever reason make the first step for the divorce?"

Like it's not ok to do to girls but it is ok to do to boys? How does this not traumatize them?

I always feel weird in MGTOW forums because I don’t actually hate women. I just work hard to avoid typical female bullshit and cut any women out of my life who try to do it. Like, I won’t ever marry again, I won’t date someone financially less secure than me and I won’t give in to emotional manipulation."
1161,,Oh I get it. They'll go way too far hating women and get the entire sub banned from reddit altogether.
1162,greenleefs,"I'm noticing a lot of deleted posts there. I recently posted about fucking the police, maybe it's that.

I've openly said on that sub, many times in the past, that I'm left-wing, even ran for office, am brown and anti-trump. It never was an issue until now.

1170,AwakenedLibrarian,"nope, mgtow is a reaction to all the cultural marxism you tacitly support in your statements. there would be no need for it as without all those fake “phobias” and the authoritarian hold with which they pervade society, you wouldnt need to be walking away from women or turtling from society. if they hadnt been empowered to destroy you with ease by invoking these ideals, mgtow would be spurious.

society is going to call your spitroasted brand of mgtow sexist, homophobic and transphobic regardless, because you support mens partial evasion of the system, which gives them carte blanche to pull a donald sutherland in the body snatchers."
1171,Chatter_,Same here. Was responding to some extremists talking about shunning off all women & then brought race into it.
1172,kissyoursister,"But the question is: why?

One thing I’ve learned from MGTOW, in my very young mind, is why should I give a shit if it has nothing to do with me? If it’s a family member, a healthy discussion or intervention about obesity is acceptable because it’s a loved one that could die as a result. I don’t see the point in making comments about a stranger’s weight. It doesn’t concern me, so there’s no point in me commenting. I’ve just learned to keep public remarks to myself unless somebody asks for my own opinion."

I didn't even reply to the notification because I knew this would be a battle that's not worth to be fought and I have bigger problems that require my energy. 

Your right. It's time that women learn about the reasons why more and more men are disinterested in marriage, having own kids or just being in a relationship. It doesn't have to be in a way that tells us ""you're all a bunch of disgusting evil shits without morals and the only way you're good for is to wreck a men."" more like ""hey. No need to be mad. It's just that the current laws disadvantages us and we don't want to risk losing our money and even freedom. It's just self defense that, hopefully, sounds logical to you."" just to answer some questions other women might have. 
I understand your reasons why you avoid women in the way you do and I feel really bad for you. If it would be men who could completely destroy me after divorcing I would want to stay away from them as well. 

Let's just hope that government wakes up, changes the laws that allow women to ruin their men if they divorce and starts letting men keep their money and property and treats them equally to women when the question who gets the custody over the kids needs to be answered. Society could be so much better if this change takes place."

1177,AmandaHolly,"I agree with you. There is no value in getting married. I am a woman, and completely agree with the point of MGTOW. I have a 20 year old son whom I’m trying to get to adopt the MGTOW mindset. He hooks up with any girl that will have him...then gets destroyed when he gets tossed aside. This has given me a HUGE wake up call when it comes to the mindset of Millennial women. I’m just worried he’s going to knock up one of these LVW, and get wrecked by the child support machine. He just doesn’t seem like he knows how to be happy with himself...thinks he NEEDS another half to make him whole. I’m single for life, by choice...I suppose the women version of MGTOW. The only part I don’t like about the main MGTOW group is that a lot of them seem to actually hate women, and revel in fucking them over. Personally, I wish marriage didn’t exist."

I'm not a mod there so I dont know the policies or whatnot, but it's not the moderating path I goto. A lot of subs do it, but that's up to the moderating teams.

I do think that talking shit about women certainly has its place. Consider golf courses or cigar clubs or poker tables. Men need a spot to complain amongst themselves about shit that frustrates them, and for a lot of men, that is women. 

I agree there should be subs that allow for that. There does need to be moderation though because the incel rhetoric can easily grow out of that, and that should be kept in check. A lot of that shit is pretty unhealthy."

>We need a community that doesn't ban men for trying to gather and help each other, and every other social media platform is happy to censor or ban any and all men's content if it isn't tits, ass, and/or beer.

Reddit admins are far above mods. If they don't like your sub, they'll find an excuse to quarantine/ban it. See the Trump-friendly sub for example.  They can even go into the database and directly edit comments without any trace. If you want to create a free speech community, reddit is not your best bet, and I have no idea what is. Sites like discord demand your phone number for """"verification"""", and if you happen to live in a country where burner phones are banned _(muh terrorism)_ then it's pretty much self-doxxing."
1292,SubaruOtter,"Eh, have a deeper look man, personally, I feel that if you're going to lump ""all women"" and ""all men"" you're equally creating an environment to foster this craziness, plus a lot of posts descend into ""I hate it when men/women do x"", and the ensuing discussion gets misogynistic or misandrist.

I think any group which has that weird, ""Hell YEAH"" attitude towards your post when you say ""I left someone who I think was bad"" is a bit odd. I support people leaving bad people, but I'm not jubilant about it. That's just me."

1313,DJ-Roukan,"Feminist will ALWAYS attack the speaker before the speech, because they cannot argue the contention put forth as they have no defense of such.

&#x200B;

Why do we think they have labeled all MRAs misogynist, all MGTOW as incels and pedophiles? Why did they try to ban the ""Red Pill"" documentary? 

&#x200B;

Show of hands kids, who has the answer? 

&#x200B;

Feminism exist today only as a function of censorship, and that is exactly why they try to paint you guys with that brush, to silence you and redirect from your argument.

&#x200B;

Look, I'm an MRA, but not MGTOW. I'm married, long term (I found a great one from a previous generation- well I may be MGTOW because I did go my own way), but the message is as clear as if it were a written like a flash burnt across the sky, and the only way it can be defended is by calling you ""misogynist"" or some other vile name so as to dismiss you and silence the conversation, keep people from looking up.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately there are too many women out there starting to agree, and as Dr. Smith stated, ""if men are not allowed to speak, I will speak for them"". I had a phone conversation recently with one of the most notable women in the MRM, and even she replied to my comment that ""I don't subscribe to women bashing"" with, ""well, society and women have a lot to account for"".  

&#x200B;

Feminism is quickly becoming a joke, a cliche', fodder for parody...and this issue is exactly why. The guys comment was fucking brilliant."
1314,30203forever,"And by ""family courts"" you mean the ""Divorce tribunals""? Because they're neither ""family"" nor ""courts"", IMHO...."
1315,30203forever,"I agree with what you wrote. Personally, I define feminism as the political movement of the sub-par females to leverage their vote in order to get their hands on the resources which they ""deserve"" but are not able or unwilling to get the traditional way (i.e. scamming the males out of their money under the current gynocentric laws). And they're using their phony ""victimhood"" because it helps greatly with that. The ""equality"" which the feminists are constantly harping about is actually the ""equality of outcome"" along the lines of: ""that woman was able to secure a good husband &/or job and  I was not; therefore, it's obvious that the patriarchy is oppressing me and I deserve to be compensated by society for being persecuted."" That's how the feminists really think and that's the very reason why you never argue with them: it's next to impossible to make someone understand something when their income depends on NOT understanding it. IMHO, the equality of outcome (i.e. communism) is not equality at all and I'm talking from personal experience, actually. As Aristotle said 2.5K years ago, ""The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal."" The feminism is evil in its most basic form and must be fought with everything we'we got because if it wins, the men will become the abject slaves, no doubt about it...."

1319,WildChad,"I have come to the exact same end conclusion that feminism, the way it trends, leads to re-introduction of slavery as it ultimately desires to have the power to arbitrarily call any sexual act a criminal offense whenever it wants - Only dictators are in the same position as the power they have is to command the hand of the law according to their will - In its completion this would reduce men to a slave class while women would be elevated to noble citizenry / master class, just like Ancient Greece and Rome had a slave class of sub-humans who were there to do all the work that could be exploited in any way on the whim of the master class citizens.  


This is the end game agenda, even if not conscious one, of feminism.  
In other words, even if well intended, this is the automatic final state if feminism does not meet enough resistance."
1320,DJ-Roukan,"You are not alone my friend. Most people have not heard a great many truths about feminism...because they have become so adept at the lie, have so much power, they can not only censor the movie, but the very fact that they did censor it.  They censor the truth, then they hide the truth, then they hide the fact that they hid the truth.

&#x200B;

Most people that I speak with on line, that still believe that feminism is about equality and not a hate group aimed at men, are so naive of the truth, have so little understanding, that it would take ten posts to bring them up to speed.

1326,DJ-Roukan,You bet. Glad to help.
1327,30203forever,">Maybe the femanuts try doing one of their ""studies"" on male Humor.

Not going to work because stupid people do not usually understand humor and hate the people who do (usually, the men). That's because the feminists are not only devoid of the sense of humor themselves, jealous of others who have it but are also very suspicious & fearful that people are joking at their expense (which is not entirely untrue...). As far as ""get a life"" goes, that's the core of the issue: they are feminists precisely because they can't get a life and NOT the other way around...."
1328,30203forever,"I saw that post an agree with that. In addition, the females want the right to reinterpret consent post-factum and sometimes years or decades after the fact. Case in point: the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. Not only that, they want their claims to be judged to be ""true till proven false"" and not the other way around (i.e. #BelieveAllWomen). In short they want the end of the Due Process but only in one direction because ""reasons"". I have a simple solution to all that mindfuckery, at least on the personal level. Do not engage with any ""regular"" women in the West. Avoid them like the plague they are. To me, they are all the property of the state, their real daddy-husband and I do not mess with the government property.... P.S. You're ""better"" than me because I reported, blocked that person & forgot about it..."
1329,DJ-Roukan,"and you are getting smarter every time I read you...

kidding of course, but dead on the money accurate."
1330,WildChad,"Oh yeah, I didn't even remember post-factum which is horrible.

In the worst case not only you'd need to record all your sex acts with women, you'd have to store them forever - And when it comes to the current practices of divorce courts, evidence for the man is often completely ignored by the judge - So practically you'd never be safe even with consent.

I think you are completely right about ending Due Process, which is currently in the process of being eroded for women just because vagina.

They often stick to me and express great joy when I'm pulling into the driveway even when I'm not the main food provider for them. They know my car a full 2 minutes early I swear.  
It's mutual. Ive always loved them and they notice.  

One cat in particular was so fond of me he wouldn't even touch his food until I took him up for a minute at least.  
He was unique, and he was stupid (inbred). We were both very attached to each other. I have a great picture of him with me but it's not on my phone. I always said that he actually wanted to be born as a dog.  

He died last year and I'm still missing him like crazy.

Politics should be on the sidebar as not allowed and I mostly could ignore the Freeper types on that sub but over time the stupidity just got under my skin.   Also, too many ""victims"" there.  Pretty sure I pissed some people off pointing that out.  Sure, things are somewhat stacked against men in our society, especially white men right now, but if you stand back and objectively look at things it is mostly background noise.   I will take being a white male in this society any day, we are NOT oppressed and if you have half a brain it is not hard to compete and succeed.   Thank god I am not saddled from birth with the crutch of ""victimhood"" like women and other groups are.

And I can say as far as ""MGTOW"" as a concept, probably 90+% of of guys on r/mgtow are just not there.   It seems more of an AA for men in pain dealing with redpill truths.    I wish them goodluck in their pursuit of ""mgtow"", its not for everyone thats for sure.   But FFS keep the reich wing political BS out of it.

1375,,"I left voluntarily. Too many self-defeatist foreveraloners that are not interested in self development. Not interested in sharing life strategies. Too eager to fall for the clickbait media. I've also been guilty of this in the past. It's very easy to get into the bitter loop concerning feminists. But brandishing all women as having the same agenda is just as stupid as a libtard saying all men are toxic. It serves no purpose. It brings nothing to the quality of your life. MGTOW subreddit in its current state is an echo chamber.

I've seen a conversion from when the incel subreddit got banned. Most of the MGTOWs who shared their wisdom are no longer on the subreddit. A MGTOW I met in London even calls them menimists and refuses to go back on there. A few good posters remain. But they are drowned out by the overwhelming outrage porn.

It's a sinking ship. And that's because visiting the subreddit leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. A hyper focus on the worst of female nature. The worst of society.

Men need male spaces though. Men need brotherhood. Is this subreddit got the markings to provide that? I'm not entirely sure at the moment. However, for me it's time to turn a new leaf. Get back to the original intention of MGTOW. It wasn't to shun yourself away from society. It was to avoid commitment aka marriage and anything that does not serve men on his path. It was to place your hobbies and interests at the forefront. To realise that you're more than just your biological imperative. And I kind of deviate here from most MGTOWs, I don't think hooking up with women is bad if you are smart about it. Essentially the first inception of MGTOWs were the single bachelor types. I think through MGTOW subreddit getting popular. With YouTubers echoing clickbait  like TFM reading out the horror stories of gynocentrism it's become a bastardised version of itself.

Anyways, just my thoughts."

I am convinced that r/MGTOW has been feminised and corrupted by feminists and anti-MGTOW shills. To be banned from the subreddit for having a discussion about MGTOW while the racist idiot sits in there doesn't surprise me. The fact that a text if admin would take sides with a racist does surprise me.

“I’m glad others are seeing this trend and speaking up as well. I first subscribed to MGTOW because there were good articles about self improvement and building better habits. The trend seems more and more externally focused and less and less about self improvement.

Believe it or not, I remember when this sub use to be a place of discussion, a place where men turned to - to better themselves on their new found path, a place where men have chosen to go their own way to rectify what’s been torn apart do to the aftermath’s of failed marriages and relationships. Now almost all of that helpful knowledge and sound advice is being clouded by articles and rants that reflect misogyny, and at times, pure black pilled hatred. 

I understand that a lot of us come to this sub with red pill rage and need that outlet, but that rage will be the very death of this sub. Downvote this into oblivion for all I care, but I know there are men here who feel the same, if they haven’t already moved on.

My comment:

[Just out of curiosity, can’t this be applied to males as well? A lot of my mates are pretty promiscuous dudes and have had plenty of one night stands. So with this logic, are they no different from the women this excerpt aims to shame? 

Not trying to ruffle feathers, just kinda curious on the stance about men that do the things MGTOW hate about women (cheating, sleeping around, using another person for any kind of temporary/ personal gain, etc.). I try not to keep dudes like that in my friend circle anymore,  I can certainly say I’ve seen a lot of men do these things that women are so demonized for.  I’ve certainly been fucked over by the opposite sex, but a lot of my mates have done the same to some genuinely nice women. 

As a single male, I wonder about the MGTOW movement and if it is too extreme of an ideology for me. Don’t mind the GMOW part, since that is the life I tend to lean towards as an introvert, but I love my mother, and sisters, and have met genuinely kind women.]


Hopefully some of you in this sub can answer this without me being banned first. I’m looking for camaraderie with people who aren’t so relationship focused and driven by the need for someone else in their life to make them happy, but MGTOW might be too extreme or me."

I'm all for male independence, but I feel that constantly going around in a circlejerk of hating women just proves that the people who hang out there are clearly not over it. Being one sided and keeping an eye out for only bad women which fit the narritive in your head is just asking to get into a toxic mindset imo: vicareously playing the victim of a minority of women who play the victim to take advantage of men

Well idk, either because I’m a chick or because I genuinely was trying to understand their logic- or both.. probably both.

I had pointed out that I was gaslighted by my ex boyfriend and somehow found myself at 19 years old paying all the rent, all the groceries, and meanwhile my ex boyfriend five years older than me- lying, cheating, and spending his money on a new bong or Xanax addiction- I was trying to point out that it wasn’t because he’s a man that he’s a shitty manipulative person.. 

I’m all for men feeling empowered without women.. but I found myself at mgtow because just like with “man haters”, neither gender should be held accountable for the world’s problems, or an individual’s problems.. and I was wondering what kind of logic they use since it does seem they blame women for all the world’s problems. 

I’d argue a lot of women’s problems are culturally pushed on women by other women, and same with men. 

And also, I have more male friends than female friends... like the two genders aren’t strictly romance based... but mgtow makes it out to be just a biological reproductive thing between the genders.. platonic relationships are important."

1512,Itiswrittenkjv1611,I was banned after contributing there for a year. I made a post title that may have made them think I was a woman. Maybe I was banned automatically by a bot or something. IDK But no mods will respond and it is stupid. Guess I will have to post here now.
1513,DiogenesObserves,This is what happens when normies shilling as mgtows infiltrate the sub.
1514,Akathist,An old account of mine was banned because I referred someone who complained about the state of that sub to MGTOW2. I suspect he was also banned.
1515,MParry6,"Banned for literally saying on a post about Instagram attention whoring, word for word “this could be applied to men too tbf”. Go to reply to some prick who replies with some massively triggered response and couldn’t.

Been on there since it was at like 26k. Tbh, it’s gotten more and more astray and negative since about the 60k user mark. The amount of posts I see by users using tinder is just ridiculous. I’m all for doing what you want but surely using tinder is the exact opposite of what that sub is all about. Certainly was when I first found it.

No reply from the mods, so I’ve decided I am going to keep messaging them until I get a response. I don’t want back in, if anything this is a blessing, but just want an explanation.

I’m hoping this place is more about actually going your own way and sharing uplifting posts, rather than constant negativity and enjoying when some woman gets killed or whatever."
1516,ViolentJenniferLopez,"I got banned for no reason that I can think of, other than having deleted my main account due to a doxxing threat.

I know this is pointless but whatever.

I'm as full on MGTOW as it gets but this does not and will never mean I vote repub.

Righties have to stop gatekeeping this ideology.

It's not political and has nothing to do with poltics.

I'm south asian and obviously this is to save me future conflict if my ethnicity is ever mentioned out of necessity

I've realized they toss repetitive memes and generally lack discussion to reinforce passionate dislike to wamen than move on. The brightside was witnessing beautiful photographs taken by some

It's as though they don't want men other than the like of themselves to go MGTOW and complain about blue pillers and simps making life harder for them whom are described to pander to the toxicity of a gynocentric establishment.

1520,women-are-the-proble,"I don’t think ever women in the world wants us dead or in their pocket but the numbers are rising and we need to break free from our biology. We are scared about other men because of our fear of being cuckolded and not having our genes progressed. What I am trying to say is a lot of these issues are to do with partners not matching ( ugly or ugly etc) and the capitalist system which is destroying the environmental and sociological spheres of life. We need to truly look at what we NEED in life not what we want. Because right now basic needs are not being met by 60% of the population. We are all connected and have the ability as a species to inflict pain on someone else emotionally and even subconsciously. 

It’s time we stopped saying left right etc and realised who the war is against- capitalism"

Most of the white men on that subreddit have a long way to go before they're able to redpill themselves when it comes to matters of race.  They think, speak and behave from the same deluded hive mind of whiteness that blue-pillers think, speak and behave from.

1525,Brandwein,"Oh wow didn't think the banning was so wide spread.

Happened to me too.

1536,In_This_Here_Economy,"MGTOW went to shit for the exact same reason feminism did: the reactionary, fringe elements have become the leading voices of the movement.  I don't share the beef with feminism that a lot of MGTOW men believe that they have to have.  I know and understand that feminism, at it's core, is just as much about dismantling gender roles for men as it is women.  If I am to be honest, it was actual feminism that taught me self respect as a man and why I was compelled to a lot of the behaviors and concepts of myself, women and the world that I had, and that reason is patriarchy.  The same men who brag about how it's been primarily men who've created civilizations and governments are the same ones who deny the existence of patriarchy unironically and under the spell of cognitive dissonance.

It's ridiculous, actually.  

The most important thing, I think, for a man to remember is that he doesn't have to hate women to recognize and respect himself as a human being, and he doesn't have to hate himself to recognize and respect the humanity of women."
1537,throwawayapparently9,"the real problem is not the act of ""getting banned."" 
you could always use throwaway accounts to get back there and I'm fine with it.
but the real probelm is that you ""can NOT contact them""! 
it doesn't matter how hard you try or if ""one of the old guys"" you were there, they will never respond you back, NEVER. 
I've been banned from dozens of subreddits, especially LGBTs, feminists, cuckoldery fetishists, adulteries, affair advices, cheating experiences, and I'm cool with getting banned from there, because they are my ""enemy"" territory, getting banned from there is EXPECTED. 
but when i got banned from mgtow? hell no, i wasn't expecting that. i was a men's right activist and a mgtow commentator at the time, and i always considered manosphere my FRIENDLY territory (except PUA and Incels, we don't share much in common) but i never expected a BAN from mgtow. 
the problem is, they won't tell you WHY they banned you and they'll never give you a SECOND chance ever again.
so if the moderators don't want to give a fuck about banned members, why should banned members give a fuck about them? 
and again, they're NOT the OFFICIAL mgtow, as they have confessed it themselves in subreddit. 

but after that, i can't trust any FRIENDLY territory anymore. 

I'm always expecting getting banned from MRA and MGTOW_2 now and i could never trust any territories anymore but i expect a little decency from moderators to respect me and tell me why i got banned and how i can get unbanned."

1556,-Entilzha_Valen-,"Well...got banned from there...again.  Not sure if it was for recommending this sub to someone who sounded more reasonable than most of the ‘tard’s there...

Or if it was for telling people to read the article in a linked post and not the narrative driven synopsis that someone made.

Basically the synopsis said the woman got away with the crime, she was released no charges.  But the article said she was re arrested, charged with multiple crimes, and was undergoing a psych evaluation.

Proof positive that the narrative is the most important thing there and not any form of truth.  Sounds like /r/politics."

I'm not sure that it's all that unpopular around here.  However I think that encouraging it is [a mistake](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/unique-everybody-else/201303/internet-ranting-and-the-myth-catharsis).  I'm not saying that people who are angry shouldn't be encouraged to discuss their anger and its underlying causes.  I am saying that the constant focus on negativity over on that sub is counterproductive and only helps hold people in that state and keeps them from moving on to better things."
1558,cooler_water,"Yes, but the majority of MGTOW1 posts/comments were all about misogyny, and anyone that thought otherwise was shunned by the masses. That isn't healthy "

1577,Implausible-asset,"I can tell you why I avoid women 24/7. Speaking only for myself:

1. Marriage is a raw deal for men. Everyone knows this. I dont want to subject myself to that kind of slavery.

2. Dating and girlfriends: Every girlfriend I've had has either cheated on me with someone who had more money or a better position in life. Monkey branching. I dont fault them for it now, it's just their nature. And I dont enjoy the feeling of a breakup when I was thinking everything was ok. Casual dating equates to more buying free dinners than romantic reward, and it's expensive I'd rather use those resources on my self. Also the breakup psycho factor. Consensual sex and turn into a rape claim that without any investigation at all can ruin your life. No thank you 

3. Women in the workplace: I am 100% professional all the time, and make sure I'm never alone with one. A false claim to HR about touching her butt or her being offended by a joke  can have you out on your ass faster than 5pm comes on a holiday weekend. It's not worth the risk.

4. Day to day life: they only talk to you if they want something from you. And I dont want to give them anything. I want to do what I want to do. 

Staying away from women keeps me focused, energized, and moving forward. It's the way I mgtow, and mgtow is freedom. "
1578,thalobby,They're probably afraid of getting #metoo'd

1625,Impossible-asset,Cognitive dissonance: don't think one can be mgtow and be married. Pretty sure that puts you into MRA territory. I mean the whole premise of mgtow is men not getting married and exposing themselves to the inherent liabilities of it all.
1626,,"Yea I was on the .com website for a while, it's all but fucked now.  I'm banned from the original sub as well"
1627,steelyknife1122,"You had probably been shadow banned before you were banned. I can't see some of your comments in the comment section, but I can see them on your profile."
1628,ArmondDillo,"Those cunts use a lot of shady tricks, they were fucking with me for weeks before i finally got outright banned. That fag /u/ss_camaro literally bans people if they're getting too many points, because he gets jealous. Also they didn't like me using the term ""roast beef whore."" They must, themselves, be sons of roast beef whores."
1629,In_This_Here_Economy,This.
1630,Loban8990,"Something I've been afraid of for the last year or so is MGTOW becoming an echo chamber. There was a time when the sub wasn't so vitriolic. We would share ideas, and hobbies and give advice. I've been a member there since 2014 (this in an alt account). I remember those days."
1631,-Entilzha_Valen-,"I'm too the point I think they ban for pretty much any post that gets reported.  So if you cause anyone butthurt and they report you, you get banned."
1632,ksimbobbery,Literally worse than incels
1633,yermanbob,"It occurs to me that both females and males, of all the flavours of pills, make these sorts of judgements based on their favourite celebrity of the moment.

To me it seams strange basing such a broad opinion on an extremely small evidence base of rich people.

Surely it would be easier to accept that normal people age in different ways, it's mostly dependent on lifestyle choice. Or am I missing something? While genes do play a role I'd argue that money /epigenetics is a far stronger contribution to change.

Perhaps I've had one to many beers?"
1634,Dharmathinker,"I agree. Even if there is some things to criticize about modern day women. It does no good at all to spend so much energy and time hating on them.  The idea of mgtow was clearly to focus on self development. and alot of them completely miss that.  

And god for bid you bring up the idea of talking about other things and not women.  Theyll call you names and just defend them selves"
1635,30203forever,"All their rules are bullshit and custom-made to be able to ban anyone for any reason or no reason at all. It appears to me though that they especially hate the MGTOW who are out of the red pill rage. No serious discussions allowed, methinks. But hey, I haven't been there for half a year since I got banned and not going back because that sub is as good as gone..."

1639,NathanHollister,"In all fairness, it's easy to spread. Just drop redpills on your friends and family. And feminism redpills more men every day as they expand the welfare state and make the laws against men worse (TFM mentioned a woman who got away with stabbing a man, and another who got only 15 months in prison for being complicit in a man's death).

Conversely, having kids just makes one more future feminist. Because odds are good you lose the kid to a feminist wench, or the public school indoctrinates your kid, or college indoctrinates him. Kids are fine, as long as you adopt and homeschool him. Otherwise, he's probably fucked no matter how redpill you are"
1640,Implausible-asset,"That's easy. Just apply mgtow philosophy to yourself when other men see you succeeding in life while they are struggling, theyll ask, and you tell them how. 

It's easy as that. Men know when something isnt working, but they do need to be able to see a logical, clear path out. And that is what mgtow is."
1641,Uncle_Vodka_237,"Yep, It will be interesting to see what happens to that sub over time."
1642,Tsukikoselenia,"Seems like a common pattern here. It's probably what happens when you go against what a mod thinks when he's in a bad day despite not having broken any rule. 

Which is kind of weird because you don't even have to defend women for this to happen; sometimes he's just triggered by what you were saying and seems to havethe self-control of a child."
1643,BoskOfPortKar,WTF
1644,AcrobaticAge,"What??? You were one of the few insightful guys there.

I better be prepared to be banned, since I have been openly vocal about how I don't like that sub getting ridden by incels."

1646,BluetoothMcGee,Username (and subsequent projection) checks out.
1647,XFinalPhantom,"Same, at one point, almost made me feel like I wasn’t Mgtow. But then I realized that it’s moderators who are assholes. Mgtow is a great train of thought, but we look no better than feminists. Sometimes I feel like they want women dead just like feminists want men dead. It’s toxic, I feel that not all women are bad, but marriage and relationships never worked to begin with. It’s society hoping for something to be true when it’s not in human nature."
1648,Uncle_Vodka_237,"Man, I'll tell ya. Reading that shit makes me so fucking glad I've given up on relationships.

> I hate myself, I hate this, I hate how complicated relationships are.

I agree with you when you say both genders are susceptible to having relationship doubts. Those incels only want to see it one way. All women are cancer etc..."
1649,DatingTank,"Lol, it was that same post that spiraled me to a ban. I just can't shut up when something is clearly fake or wrong, but people keep using it to confirm a narrative. It's exactly the same that the worst SJWs are known for. It's a shame they're not holding it to a higher standard in there. It's becoming increasingly toxic."
1650,DJDickJob,"It really is a shame, that sub used to be awesome. I learned a lot from that place and felt like sharing my own stories might help younger guys gain some insight, but I got banned for agreeing with someone that said MGTOW1 had started to seem sexist. I added that I think it's because a lot of incels have come here, and got immediately banned. I had been active on there for like 1.5 years and never had any problems. There's a special place in internet hell for all these bitch ass corrupt mods and admins."

1654,Impossible-asset,Why am I not surprised at all to that nonsense on mgtow. Has nothing to do with  mgtow at all.
1655,Impossible-asset,"I'll leave it up because:
1. If that's what you did to get banned from the mgtow sub, then that's what you did.
2. Please do not repeat that sort of behavior here.this is not a sub to engage in inflammatory commentary on
 Thank you."
1656,ksimbobbery,"That just makes you a bad, hateful person"
1657,MParry6,"It used to be about literally checking out and gong your own way. Now, with over 100k subs, it’s become some sort of mutated top trumps, women are pure scum zone that is so full of negativity and anger, it doesn’t help anything.

If you want to kill something, make it popular."
1658,Impossible-asset,"Welcome to mgtow. The 2 is incidental...

It's not a movement, it's a sub where we try and foster active conversation amongst men who are going there own way. 

The mods spend a *slight* bit of time trying to curate it constantly so it stays focused on the positive. 

For the bad stuff if it gets through, that report button and the good old downvote button used properly is a big help. 

Enjoy it here and hope to read your good contributions."
1659,Booksarepricey,A lot of it is just human nature. The negatives of it get lumped in as descriptors of the groups of people we don't like. It's incredibly polarizing.
1660,,"Yeah. Those guys are getting unstable with every passing day. There was a post for people to talk about their difficult childhoods on that sub. Guess what? Those motherfuckers had to come and ruin that. A particular asshat called me my father's bitch cuz my father treated me like shit and said I'd go back kissing his ass when I need him.

What a toxic shitshow of a sub. I just replied to the bastard and reported his comments. There are too many assholes who hide behind their devices and talk shit on the sub.

I'm thinking of unsubbing from that crapwaste."

1668,Implausible-asset,"I get it why they discuss women. Keyword being discuss. 
You have talk about what women do and their behaviors and how it affected you. It's good, its healthy. And it helps other men who may be stuck in similar situations find their way out of it. 

But what they do over there now is just bash bash bash women all the time but they dont offer solutions, advice, or success stories. "
1669,-Ecliptic-,"I got banned for pointing out they are the flipside of the SJW coin.  They were bitching about Captain Marvel being to SJW because of female lead...

The time before that banned for pointing out they hate Game of Thrones because it has a few strong female characters.

It's hilarious how they bitch about the stereotype and then work so damned hard to live down to it."

1671,SleepyMethHead,"Just like you opened yourself to be hurt by that man... us men do the same thing with women. We just do it for different reasons. 

But like in any sub reddit you’ll likely get banned if your going against the sentiment within that bubble of thought.

I agree platonic relationships are important, but they are hard to sustain. Friends I have that are girls disappear when they get into relationships 9/10 times and I hate when they breakup and want to be my friend again. But yes I enjoy female friends."
1672,nbjmcclellan,"Next time try pm’ing some user you see posting, MGTOW isn’t women friendly because it is men going their own way, not everyone going there own way. But if you’d like to pm me and ask about it feel free, I’m an avid humanitarian and a huge fan of almost all of what MGTOW stands for."
1673,BluetoothMcGee,"You wanna know why you were banned? It's because it's blatantly obvious that you didn't read [anything from](https://archive.fo/wCyUm) [the sidebar](https://archive.is/xPOqz) or the rules of the subreddit and instead chose to be yet another one of our run-of-the-mill trolls who does exactly what we expected: start drama and conflict masquerading as a ""debate"", and when called out, proceed to shame, project, and gaslight. You weren't ""genuinely"" trying to understand us. At all. No one bought your BS. And of course you're here portraying yourself as the victim of the banning that you yourself have initiated. It's almost like clockwork.

And you wonder why we pledged to stay away from your gender as far as possible."
1674,,"Originally MGTOW was more of a safe haven for men who have given up on women/traditional relationships. We dedicate the remainder of our lives to self satisfaction. I have no problems getting girls/laid/relationships, I'm just no longer intrested. 

Now the Incels (those who simply cannot get laid for the life of them) start claiming to be MGTOW, and spewing toxic female hate comments, have really ruined the face of the community. 

MGTOW2 is very humble and less interested in bashing women. I am open to discuss female nature, tactics, AWALT, but I don't hate them for being what they are. Its about us, not them. 

I was banned for my comments in MGTOW and really dont care. This sub is the true face of rhw community, and represents what it stands for. "

1677,Trek13,"your history and mine are pretty much the same.   Was on r/mgtow from around 20K users to around 100K.   When they banned me (the second time) I pretty much knew why.  Didn't ask why, just sent them a ""thank you"" note.   Needed the clean break from too much toxic negative shit."

1693,Spike-Ball,"Thank you for this. I was really interested in MGTOW at first, until I spent some time on the sub Reddit and saw by far mostly posts that focused on hating women. Hating women makes them just as bad as the extreme feminists that hate men. The existence of one justifies the other, and perpetuates it.

I thought it was great to see posts showing a member enjoying their life and doing something fun, until they make additional effort just to hate on women within the same post. And of course they ban anyone that criticizes or calls out their bullshit."
1694,Impossible-asset,"We do not ban users lightly. Obvious and repeated trolling, calls for violence, spam, and bots, yeah that'll catch a ban.

Oh, crap. I just had a hilarious, yet horrific, and likely inaccurate, thought. What if all of the mods weren't only women but *feminazis* who only created the sub to lure men to it and encourage them to post misogynistic BS so they can use a 3rd party program to extract user IPs, and are creating a secret database of ""the enemy"" to doxx them and bring them to ruination? Honestly, a lot of the things posted there would cause those men to get fired if their employers saw it. That would explain why they ban people who make sense.

Over the time period I was at MGTOW1  I could see the mods becoming less tolerant and more willing to use the ban hammer.     Was this because of the fast growth of the subreddit, now over 100K?    Perhaps they became overwhelmed somewhat.     Hope a similar thing does not happen to MGTOW2 as it grows."

MGTOW is married to the idea that you'll be happier without solipsistic women in it. But you become self-serving solipsistic yourself. You also become utterly miserable without fulfilling your biological imperative. It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons. 

Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men. So what's the difference? Because all I see is men like this too. Especially MGTOW men who aren't interested in building community. I spent a year trying to build a community around MGTOW with users and they were never interested. All they want to do is moan about women all day. 

MGTOW doesn't make you happy. Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving. Society as an whole has become too big. Where as men and women would thrive in smaller communities. There are too many issues just to blame it all on women. And as society increases so does its lack of empathy and the feeling you are just a number. So better to build small communities.

I do not agree with that and feminism is actually damaging woman on the long road. Just as men are *better* in natural fields, woman have insticts and operate on levels unimaginable for men. Man can be Simping for years and could not see it but woman will notice the shit much more quickly. You can lie a woman for a year but to a man awhole life. They have *antennas* or special instincts (mother instincts) that cannot be accessed by pure logic and intellect.

The fact that it's a community based subreddit that states to its members that it's nothing to do with community goes to show you that it is utterly self-serving. How is that any different than any woman or man you meet today in society?

MGTOW just plays into the narcissistic division segregationist society. It literally says, ""Okay society, you win! Now let me get my fill"" and instead becomes exactly what nihilist society wants in a MGTOW's own image. 

How did I draw that conclusion? That chase of career. The chase for material. Elliot Hulse said it better that ""I'm with you MGTOW but you focus too much on the matter. The mother world. The material.""

And I believe he is right to some extent. There's no harm in bettering your career but if that's all you do and all you aspire it material, what is your legacy? 

>Being self-serving doesn't mean I'm harming anyone else in the process

Not at all but its essentially why societies collapse. It's a communist-like mindset. And as the population grows into self-serving narcissism so does the utter disdain and divide amongst people. 

>MGTOW has made me happier than I've ever been, so I don't know what you mean by that. 

It's all about how it makes you feel. Which is the issue with this society. It's always self-entitled. Self-centered thinking about its own self. It doesn't want to better the lives of those around them. It is one degree away from feminism.

>Learning to not depend on anyone but myself for happiness is the biggest step I've taken in my entire life. The fact that there are shitty people from both genders has nothing to do with why MGTOW is still relevant.

MGTOW is relevant in a nihilist society. I've come to the conclusion its a way of coping and becoming just like modern women. Which only serves to divide and segregate everyone. 

But you never see MGTOWs want to get together and build a community. All you get is, ""MGTOW is about your own path"" And being surrounded by self-serving entitled men just reminds me of a male version of feminism. 

What beyond the basics of don't get married and be careful does MGTOW provide? There's no pearls of wisdom beyond a few YouTubers. Majority of golden posts are from The Red Pill and books that don't follow the self-serving approach.

And MGTOW can't even do what they set out to do anyway. They focus too much on negative female experience. They talk about women all day on MGTOW1 and how much monsters they are. They give women their power away by making them the boogeyman/woman.

Atleast The Red Pill aspires for community. Atleast it brings men into its fold and looks after them within their small community. MGTOW does nothing but worship the self. And that's how we got here in the first place.

So you can say MGTOW has helped you. Perhaps it has. But I didn't come here to serve myself. I came here for brotherhood because without it any community inevitably collapses. Just like the PUA community did.  Stronger together, divided we fall. And it will always be this way. A community without guidance is going nowhere. 
"
1811,Impossible-asset,"One thing that is an important consideration when you are talking about the principle of ""AWALT"" (all women are like that). It is pointless to bring up ""NAWALT"" (not all women are like that), because unless someone is genuinely disturbed in the head, they will know that out of the 4 billion women on the earth, it is not even statistically possible that every single one will be an ""awalt"" type. 

The whole reason that AWALT is even a saying is because there is enough of a risk in dating, relationships, and marriage today that AWALT is a reminder of a real danger you face as a man. 

If I were given a 50 gallon drum of apples, and only 10 of them were poisonous, but the only way to tell the poisonous ones from the good ones is after I take a bite, I wouldn't be worried about what my odds are of ""finding a good apple"". I'd slap a big warning label ""DANGER: POISONOUS APPLES, DO NOT EAT"" on the side, and leave the whole thing out by the dumpster for trash pickup. 

That's what AWALT is. It's a warning that engaging in an activity has many detriments, and few benefits. It's not a scientific statement. 

Many guys get stuck in being angry after being on the receiving end of a ""poisonous apple"" when it comes to women. And so they choose to walk away from that in the future. Some stay angry, which is what I am hoping to help get them out of by having a sub like this where they can talk with other mgtow men about how they can move on successfully. The other mgtow sub is for staying stuck in the anger side of things. 

What women do mgtow men want? well, depends. When it comes to marriage and cohabitation, the answer is none. For myself, I extend that to girlfriends, dating, and any non-professional relationship. Though some mgtow men are open to that."
1812,Deadpanpancakes,"Its not so much that there are a few ""good women"". I think looking at people through the lens of good and bad are too simplistic. People as a general rule are selfish and self serving. Obviously it is to a degree that doesnt jeopardize other things they want. Also, people tend to delude themselves into thinking that they arent ""wrong or bad"" when they want to justify doing something that is pretty abhorrent. Im more concerned about the society around us that holds women to many double standards or the fact that theres sometimes no recourse for a man and nobody seems to give a shit.  You take the shaky moral relativistic nature of women and their selfish attitude and combine it with the male hating legal system and you get men opting out because it is the reasonable thing to do."

>It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons.

It does matter that not all women are evil as you say. There are plenty of evil women to go around and all it takes is one to destroy a man's life.

>Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men

This is the men and women are equal lie. Why? Because lets say you have 2 children, the one every time he does something wrong you punish and the other child you allow to do what ever he wants. Who do you think is going to be well behaved the child that was getting punished every time he did something wrong or the child that you did not punish when he did something wrong? It's obvious that it's going to be the child that was getting punished when he did something wrong. In our case men are being punished and women are being allow to go unpunished or get a slap on the wrist. Just look at
all the women that have falsely accused men of rape for example. When was the last time you heard of a man falsely accusing a woman of rape? There is no way men and women are going to act the same when women have the state backing them and men just have
themselves backing them. Also men and women are different so they are not going act the same. Men were the protectors and providers because men think others. Just look what happens when there is a catastrophe. It's men that jump into rescue others at a risk to their own lives.

>All they want to do is moan about women all day.

What this guy is effectively saying is if you're going way why do you talk about women so much. The reason men need to talk about female nature is because we are trying to help other young men not to fall into the traps women and society are trying to get young men to fall into.

>Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving.

Obviously men are going to start becoming self-serving. What did you expect men to be generous when women are so selfish? So men should just continue to give and give and give while women continue to abuse men?

>Society as an whole has become too big

So this guy is into eugenics.

We only get one day at a time, it's best enjoyed if we're living in it!"
1839,HonkHonkBro,"Wow. Haven't been on Reddit in a while and now it's hard hitting to have this as one of the first things to see. Let me reach out to ya man to man dude. I lost my mom about a decade ago, middle school. Gained a step mom since. It completely devoured everything from before and nobody in my family was in any way the same since. I still struggle to this day to understand what kind of person my mom was and who my dad was vs how he is now. My step mom is very different from my mom. I also now have sisters and half sisters. I am the sole brother, but not eldest. I mention this because it all gave me some of the most painful experiences that have made me more eye opened than average, and I want it to help you and other men too. Unlike many men, women haven't been an experience to me through media, gfs, etc. It was and still is direct and open. Losing a parent is tough. Losing a wife is tough. Losing a daughter is tough. It shakes people usually, it makes strong people vulnerable, but it can just as easily make vulnerable people strong. One thing it has opened my eyes to, is that whatever good a mother teaches needs to be strongly considered. Some lessons need to be combed through, analyzed and filtered. Some were spoken, others are shown. Do you know what one of the BIGGEST eye opener was and the one thing I absolutely swore, no matter what, to honor? Her last note before she passed:

Do not ever get a girl pregnant before you are ready.

Let that sink in, as that note itself negotiates between life and death. To me, it was a clear warning, whether it was meant to be or not. And I decided that I now have one blood parent left, a man. My father. And despite his own flaws, I realize that now he's become even more vital as he is the only other male in my family as both of my grandfathers have also passed and my uncles are distant from him in ways I am not. He went through his own deep psychological trauma, and I realize now he struggled as I did, a man expected to ""be a man"" while other family members benefited through other men's support and/or empathy he rarely got. Now, despite differences, I do feel closer to him than other family even maybe more than his second wife or his own mom. We bond as father son, as it should be and as men supporting men, as it also should be. Take this as you may."
1840,mgtow-Dream0,sorry for your loss brother.   and ya that is probs the realest statement.
1841,iceman8199,"Don’t ever apologize for a statement like that. I am fortunate enough to have a great family. My dad passed when he was 70 back in 2012 of prostate cancer (after a 12 year battle). And my oldest brother just passed of a heart attack this past September at age 54.

Life is precious, man. My mom and my middle brother are still alive. He is 51, my mom is 78. I don’t know how much time she has left, but I certainly believe it’s not a lot. 

My mom has been the one woman in my life that I can completely trust and she never steers me wrong. My dad was the same way. 

Consider yourself lucky to have a mom like that, but also she was lucky to have you in her life as well, it sounds like to me from the way you speak of her. 

The best thing you can do is go on and live your life in her honor, especially since she is the one who gave it to you. I have lost a lot of people in my life that I loved, and that is the best tribute you can give. 

Good luck, man. We’re all here for ya."
1842,tangyorangatang,"This doesnt seem to be talked about much here, but the first step for a man becoming MGTOW in life is when he becomes financially and emotionally independent of his mother (and father, but more so mother). 

The stereotype of lazy millennials is partly due to mothers not letting their kids grow up. They keep them at home, pay their bills, pack their lunch, emotionally coddle them etc. Even when the kid is in their 20s, or worse 30s. 

MGTOW isn't just about being independent of relationships, it's about being independent of all women, and even all people. I'm sorry for your loss, and I'm probably being a bit insensitive here, but maybe I can present a productive and healthy point of view to look at this from."
1843,nknarula,"You're lucky in a way. My mother didn't do that. She was mean and gaslighting me constantly. I sked my Dad while he was alive why mom komhated me and his reply was, ""because you remind her of me"". Mom is still alive, but stopped talking to me when I questioned her about some bad behavior on her part when I was 5. My question was basically just asking her why she called me a bastard all the time when u was 5."

1848,DonMelbourne,"> MGTOW isn't just about being independent of relationships, it's about being independent of all women, and even all people.

No, it really isn't. **MGTOW is the RATIONAL decision to avoid legal entanglements with women based on a cost/benefit analysis of marriage/co-habitation. You build your world your way.**

What you are talking about is something different. You can be MGTOW and be independent of people, certainly. But going your own way is about your own choices. If that includes dependence on people, then that can also be a choice consistent with MGTOW, at least in my humble opinion.

My fear is that we start locking ideas into what MGTOW is that really has nothing to do with MGTOW. All people -- men and women -- should have healthy relationships with family, as long as their own needs aren't compromised. I agree that ideally we should be independent of our parents, but it isn't a MGTOW thing, it is a maturity thing. I'm happy to discuss if you disagree.

As a MGTOW, you can love your mother, you can even be dependent on her; just don't marry her."

I'm 60 years old, I love my mother and I will be devastated when she passes. There is an inter-dependence there, since I provide physical care and she provides some emotional support. Am I going my own way, in your opinion?

I'm not really arguing with you, in that I have my own definition of MGTOW which I am happy to stick to, and no doubt you are the same. I'm just interested in understanding where you are coming from."

It's like a lifelong alcoholic getting clean and then telling everyone not to drink or being a lifelong pot smoker but supporting keeping it illegal. It's great and all, but people usually have to play the field in order to get it out of their system. Just be careful when you play the field and you'll be fine.

I wouldn't expect a 20 year old to remain a lifelong loner just because of a saying some 50 year old wrote after doing the exact opposite. It doesn't make the sayings not true, but a 20 year old will feel deprived if he actually takes this advice, in my opinion."

With America's steady rise in popularity in terms of entertainment and politics over the decades, people all over the world have been increasingly made more ""western"", which translates into taking in all the bad points of being an american.

Even in countries like mine which couldn't be further from US, both geographically, and socially, you can see the cancer of western feminism creeping in and breaking society from the inside.

It's difficult to think where feminism is going right now, but for me, feminism as a movement became redundant by the year 2000. Hey, atleast you don't have to worry about fake allegations right?"
1884,rquasius,"I've said it before and I think Jordan Peterson has too.   The only way this problem with Western women will get solved at this point is if SANE women start countering the wackiness of the 3rd wave feminism being spawned.  Because you posting here is preaching to the choir.  Some women are standing up, like  Bettina Arndt,  Karen Straughan  and others.

Thanks for posting your point of view, always nice to hear it is not just us ""MGTOWS"" that have these types of thoughts.   I think modern society breeds mental illnesses and social media just throws fuel on the fire, the more I examine modern life the more I feel like it impacts all of us in a negative way at one point or another, man, woman, straight , gay, whatever alphabet letters one likes modern society will shit on you at some point.

1920,,"The problem is that the extreme majority of women who are anti-feminists still want all the power and privileges feminism has brought them.  They are against feminism for victimizing men (and for being crazy), but just as strongly against removing things that give them advantages and power.  Such as legal preference in child custody and alimony and the stupidly easy divorce laws, etc.  And when I say ""legal preference"" I mean that the woman is by default the legal provider to the child and so there are actually men out there who pay their ex-wife child support even though the men in question have custody of the child.

Basically, most women who are anti-feminism are pro-girl power.  Which is feminism just without being openly anti-male.  Feminism = anti-male to get power, girl power = pro female to get power.  The power and privileges and dominance they want is the same, they just try to get it by being nice instead of by being hostile."

1923,,"It'll probably catch up with them during their performance evals, but that's an year out."
1924,,"Hmm, my observation hasn't quite been that. I'm friends with two gay men who've shared their very deep misgivings about the metoo movement, and the ""liberal"" left in general. One of them is a libertarian voting white man, while the other is a Republican voting latino man. One of the my other trans friends is openly pro-Trump, who she sees as the only person who's crazy enough to stand up to the ""liberal"" left (her words, not mine).

On the larger screen there are groups like Gays for Trump who are definitely not aligned with #metoo folks.

As all of you know, there's a personal and professional cost to not being on board with these liberal movements. Especially if you're living in a large, ""liberal"" city, it can be very isolating for LGBT people to be vocal about their beliefs about these catchy-named movements which lack any substance. Not making any justifications though

1925,,"Genuine question - how do you think I could've stopped getting the award? 

I shared here because I wanted to get it off my chest and fwiw, this seemed like the only place a post like this would be tolerated (even with a throwaway account). Do you think I was treated more positively because I was a woman? If yes, how could I have stopped that?"
1926,,"Skepticism is very healthy, especially of things online.

I mentioned elsewhere that I do believe I got and still get special treatment. I despise that, but most of the time it's out of my hands. Those who know me will vouch for the fact that I don't seek it out.

I do think I can be metooed falsely. False allegations of this kind are usually made by people who are mentally unbalanced, and there is no scarcity of psychological issues in the lesbian community. I've had one very close encounter with something like that. I'd share it, but I feel I've shared too much identifying information already, and I don't want to get doxxed.

I'd probably get 50/50 custody ... unless my ex could spin my lack of support for feminism into something evil. I don't know, and I don't want to find out.

Our experiences are definitely different. But that doesn't mean that I can't see absolute abuse of the social and judicial systems at the hands of these women. I have seen more things than I've written here. It's not just about me receiving shit at the hands of women."

1928,,"I have to make sure that I'm not being put in leadership positions just because I'm a woman. I've actually been offered to lead teams in areas I'm not comfortable in, and it's a bit of a pickle trying to figure out how to weasel myself out of it without ruffling feathers or causing drama. If I say that I don't think I'm capable enough for the role, people seem to want to ""encourage"" me (because women need encouragement?) 

Luckily, the team I'm with right now, I'm fully certain that I'm a right fit for them, and they for me (at least till six months ago, when they hired the other two women). I know I'd be miserable if I were in a position I wasn't qualified or capable of being in, and I'd fight that tooth and nail. I take pride in my work, and I derive a lot of my self esteem from doing a good job at whatever I do -- I'd hate it to be taken away from me.

This is precisely why I'm against how programs advocating more diversity in tech fields are structured. It just makes everyone miserable.

Having said that, I'm sure I have received opportunities because I was a woman. The prominent one that comes to mind is that I funded my graduate studies partially off a women-only scholarship. I'm not sure how I feel about that. On one hand, I feel that if someone wants to pay money to a certain group of people, they should be allowed to do that. On the other hand, it sucked very bad to see my male peers go through financial difficulties I didn't have to go through, for the most part (though all of us, men and women, were broke, to various degrees, in grad school)"

1965,DangZagnut,"I agree, others have mentioned that as well, but I just weirdly like the flavor profile.

If I'm making this more mexican style, I don't even use beans or corn or that other nonsense."
1966,DangZagnut,"Very easy, its not at all complicated.  And I didn't put a single cheffy skill on it, although you could, because I had already spent 6 hours simmering beans.

* Can of pinto beans

* Can of Kidney beans

* Can of sweet corn kernels

* half or full lb. ground beef.  I went with half.

* trinity ( which is a mix of celery/greenpepper/onions ) or you could just use an onion.  Trinity is a Louisiana thing.

* Chili peppers, I went with two green jalapeños and two red chilies.

* Can of diced tomatoes.

* chicken stock

So first I put the trinity and beef together in the pot, with a knob of butter and let that brown up for awhile, add some garlic, let that do its thing for a bit, then start throwing the cans in.

Beans, then corn, let that sort of combine, and do the tomatoes last.  After all that I add the diced of peppers, seeds and all to give it a little spice.

After this has sort of done its thing for awhile, I add enough chicken stock to over everything, this is gong to reduce for awhile so I make sure it's all covered, also I don't know how ""wet"" I want it to be as there tends to be a lot of absorption.

Seasoning is whatever flavor mix of chili powder, cumin, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and some more garlic if warranted.  I have no specific spice blend, i just sort of make it up as I go and flavor adjust.  NO salt as all the canned crap has too much anyway.

So if everything seems fine I bring to a boil then a very low simmer and ignore it for an hour, then after it's reduced the liquid a bit I'll ladle it into a bowl, top with shredded cheese, and squirt sour cream on.

The sour cream helps with the chilis, the corn sweetness helps balance the tomatoes acidity, and the butter adds a smoothness dimension to the rendered beef fat.  top with some green onions and I'm all good.

You could eat eat with fritos, but I don't particularly do that."

Sally miller Gerhardt another very famous feminist academic said that males need to be reduced to just ten percent of the world's population, those left alive should be put into concentration camps.

My mom used to do it to me. She'd give me points for doing good things like getting good grades, helping her around the house, helping dad with his office work etc.

And then I could use these to buy myself things, like a new toy helicopter, or a bike or a game boy or something.

But the difference is, I was fucking 5 years old and this is a grown ass man, who I presume makes his own money. 

It made sense when my mom did it to 5 year old me, and I'm thankful she did that, she and dad taught me about managing responsibility and the value of hard work among other things.

I'm 19 now and my mom and dad don't do it anymore, since they know that the system has outlived its usefulness

But this is a grown adult, and even I can recognise that theres something really wrong about this whole issue"

If a man said to his friends ""I'd like to go, but I better not, my wife wouldn't like it!"", his friends would probably laugh, and understand.

If a woman said to her friends ""I'd like to go, but I better not, my husband wouldn't like it!"", her friends would be concerned and ask ""Is everything okay at home? Are you being bullied?"""

Its batshit crazy but this is (partly) how women work. There's no such thing as a strong independent woman, they've coined that phrase to make them feel like they're good at stuff.

No good deed goes unpunished. Usually the ""nice way"" of handling this is to make up an excuse. If the person persists - they are the ones being rude, not you. People in general can have a strong sense of entitlement.   


Being an attractive/cute woman, they can get people to do things for them. Good for her, but it's of no benefit to you. False accusations are real, and have even happened to Uber drivers out there who had it all filmed luckily.

Find out if you're codependent. Fix that, and life will be easy. You can say no from the start. I was co-d for  45 years without knowing it, because I wasnt a simp. I just never did anything for ME, and thought letting others do things for me was a hassle for them. 

You take away the joy others get by denying help or gifts, and likewise you steal peoples independence and decision making by doing everything for them.

A nitpick with how you phrased this: I think most women have no idea that MGTOW exists. 

Women and **men** discount MGTOW when they initially hear about it because it goes against the current narrative: men should get married, or at least pursue women, so that they can be happy(!) 

I think the kick-back against MGTOW is through a genuine desire to help men achieve happiness(!) by getting married. 'Won't you be lonely', etc. Painting it as though women hate MGTOW because it teaches men to put himself first is too broad a brush. Certainly some women might see it that way, but for the majority of women who hear about MGTOW: their criticisms of MGTOW are similar to men's criticisms."

That wasn't long ago. And for the most part, it's business as usual in this feminist society, but the cracks are present. 

What I predict will happen is either society will self correct completely, making gender distinction once again fashionable and even marketable. A push back mechanism against this gender neutrality. This could make this whole gender war just a cringe phase in our history. There's still room for ""Something in between"" in this. 

Another possibility is the eventual elimination of traditional roles or behavior models attached to sex. This is the ultimate end game of this feminist agenda. 

Either is a solid possibility. Humans are a highly programmable species. Our sense of morality and normality changes over time, and if things continue as they are now, it's inevitable."

-
Ayup... I have noted that many, **many** times within my comments in /r/MGTOW.
-
Even came up with a term for them: they're not so much MGTOW as they are the **""Ex""-**Men -- as in **""Ex""**-husbands (the ones who were married & got divorce-raped) and **""Ex""**-boyfriends (the ones who were just cohabiting or in some other ""LTR"" short of the official-legal paperwork) -- and generally speaking they're just going through their *""I'm DONE with women! [And THIS time I really mean it!!]""* phase.

-
I've also noted that -- per both statistics on divorced guys, and my anecdotal observations of men in general -- THAT stage typically lasts anywhere from a month to about a year or so (maybe a bit longer if it was a ""brutal"" breakup or devastating divorce-rape) -- before they start ""testing the waters"" (flirting, eyeing up women to at least potentially ""date"" or ""hookup"" with, logging onto {or back onto} Tinder, etc)...

-
And then, in about 2/3 of the cases, within 5 years they're ""remarried"" again (in scare quotes because they MIGHT just ""cohabit"" instead, avoiding the official-legal paperwork, as if that will save their arse)... with **most** of the remaining 1/3 just taking a bit longer (possibly having one or more ""aborted midstream"" attempts at relationships that fell short of an actual LTR/cohabit/marriage).

-
Overall, I'd bet that LESS than 1/10 (~10%) of them **actually** manage to live the rest of their lives as *true* ""MGTOW"" -- they're just TOO habituated to either the sex and/or the ""in a relationship"" identity, etc -- and too ILL-equipped to actually ""go it alone."""

2165,Frelsi_8899,"I view most women this way. 

Here's an experiment. 

Try to have female friends where the quality of the friendship is on par with your guy friends. Suspend any sexual desires, and just try to have a friendship. 

It's when you start holding women accountable to the same standard as men. When your expectations of their behavior are the same as men, that's when you'll start seeing the core problems. 

Most of them are psychotic. Most can barely keep an actual conversation. Most cannot escape their nature and cannot fathom you in any other context outside that of utility. Regardless of your best efforts to befriend a female with any hope of forming a normal friendship. Disappointingly you'll end up just being that nice shoulder to cry on. 

You'll quickly fall into the stereotypical bullshit where you sit around listening to her relationship woes. Until she's vented enough, has a paradigm shift and now has no need for the dynamic of the relationship she pushed. So she will drop you. 

Sorry to say this, but we only ended up in this shitstorm thanks to feminism. In our school days, we had it right. Most of us weren't friends with girls. We had a saying ""Chicks are for banging"". 

I'm 42 now, and yeah I even have a few female friends. They're all ""normal"" by female standards, but when you get closer they're flakey, self-absorbed and frankly a bit insane."

And then the irony of it is that the ""new"" one they eventually pick -- choose or fall for or end up with depending on how you look at it/label it -- is often (and we're talking *blatantly/obviously*) ***cut from the same EXACT cloth*** as the one they just divorced/got divorce-raped by/were alternating between crying & raging & grieving over just a year or so prior when they were in their reactionary (faux-MGTOW) ""I'm DUN with women!"" stage/phase.

-
We're talking almost IDENTICAL... as in even down to their NAMES\*...
-
So they divorce and/or get divorced by *Louisa* (that bitch, can you believe she cheated with the NEIGHBOR, expected to be forgiven and for hubby to still be NICE to that neighbor?)... but then FF a couple of years and who do they hookup with and marry but a 2x divorcee (with kids and thus one or more of her ""ex/baby-daddy"" guys nearby), and she is named... wait-for-it... *Luisa!*  

-
WTF? That's like trading off an old used Chevy because, well *""it got dented up in an accident""* and you just CAN'T STAND the idea of driving a dented up car (etc) -- but then going out and buying **another** old used Chevy, except one that's even MORE dented up because it's been in *multiple* accidents (and from the looks of it possibly even driven in a ""demolition derby"").

-
Moreover, while there usually ARE some -- relatively superficial -- differences (i.e. the first wife was a blonde, the second a brunette, etc) when it comes to voice & speaking pattern, inflections/accent, even general overall behavior & ""character"" of the person... DESPITE the insistence of the guy that ""this one is DIFFERENT from the other one""; the resemblance is sort of ""uncanny""

-
A half dozen guys that I know PERSONALLY (as in been friends either with them or with their families for decades) have followed that EXACT same pattern\*\*... it's to the point that I figure one can PREDICT (with something like at least, *if not better than,* 50% accuracy) both when and who (name/character) they WILL ""partner up with"" again in fairly short order.

-
**But to get back to YOUR point...**
-
Yes I'd say you're correct in that it is somewhere *around* if not ***more than half*** of the guys on various MGTOW forums (/r/MGTOW and /r/MGTOW2 especially) who follow that pattern.

---

And then, as you said at the end of your prior comment:

>>On the other had you have guys like me that aren't mad, we just don't give a sh!t.

EXACTLY.
-
Unfortunately... because MGTOW forums are virtually the LAST ""male space"" that allows such bitching *(sort of the same as why the guy being cheated on/divorced ends up calling his [never-married] BACHELOR buddy at 2AM*\*\*\**)* -- we end up getting painted with the brush of THEIR ""blue pill raging."" (And while **WE** calmly, coldly, objectively {and yes often a bit harshly/brutally} talk about the REALITY of female nature {and MALE nature as well, though that is often overlooked/forgotten}; **THEY** {recently or 'in the midst of' divorce/d guys) come in, repeat & exaggerate the points about WIMMIN... in an angry ""red pill"" RAGING-story fashion, bitch about their wives/gf's {especially the ""cheating"" etc}... and so the accusations of ""misogyny"" {which then have some validity}.)

-
Just like the ""incels"" -- the not only NEVER been married, NEVER ""fucked""; but *most often NEVER dated, kissed, or been even the least bit 'intimate' with a female in real life* -- who plop in, MISunderstand what MGTOW is about (often only imbibing and regurgitating the superficial ""meme-pic"" garbage), and thus contribute to the mischaracterization of the whole enterprise.

-
**The TEMPTATION** is to BLAME them... but of course the fault really lies with US (the true/actual/real ""MGTOW"" -- that is time-tested/proven as such); in that **we take PITY on these ""pathetic"" creatures** and let them into our ""clubhouse.""

-

---
\* Which I often have to wonder whether it isn't ""on purpose"" as a sort of safety/insurance -- I mean so long as the name SOUNDS the same, then if in some moment of passion (or memory error) they say their EX's name, well no one will be the wiser -- but regardless, it's rather WEIRD/TELLING that the guy who WAS married to ""Louisa"" ends up marrying a ""Luisa""; or likewise with other name-combos; the guy who divorced ""Cathy"" then marries a ""Katherine"" [Kathy], or yet again from Sarah to Sara, Susan/Suzzane[Susie/Suzie], Mari/Mary & even Marianne/Mary-Anne, Ginny/Jennifer[Jenny], Kristina/Christiana [Kris/Chris & even Krissy/Chrissie etc] and so on...

-
\*\* And there are other elements too: basically the DEPTH/HEIGHT of the ""RAGE"" and/or depression/crying that ensues... is a predictor, **not** of them *truly* becoming or following MGTOW, but rather the opposite; the MORE they rage (or cry, complain, etc -- same thing really) the MORE likely they are to ""return to the plantation"" for round #2 (and #3, etc).

-
\*\*\* Mainly because -- well not only do WE actually ""understand"" the situation (we've seen/heard it dozens if not hundreds of times before) -- but we're the only ones that will (or even practically CAN) actually TAKE their calls... especially at that hour of the day/night.

Moreover, the following:

>>Usually, at least from my own personal observations, the single mothers who are getting praised aren't getting praised for intentionally raising their children alone, but for doing the best they can to raise them alone because the man bounced and is not being a father.

That ""Usually"" there at the beginning tells me you have an inherent **prejudice** in this regard... one that you are NOT being honest about."
2185,Frelsi_8899,"The enabling aspect in all of this is that many people alive today are just living off the technological advancements of others. They do not have the intelligence to actively participate in this. They have no real social obligations either. 

They walk around with a very limited understanding of things because they're so arrogant they assume anything outside of their sphere applies through their projective nature. 

They also have far too much time on their hands and get deeply caught up in first world problems. 

Now a subset of these due to their vindictive nature and misguided compasses are just in it to stir social unrest. Some even might believe they're doing good, but without the intelligence and foresight, they cannot fathom the deeper implications of their agendas and they have no empathy to begin with anyways. 

They're a product of ""Princess syndrome"". They believe they're special, better than everyone else and always correct. 

So how do you reason with these people? Worse is that all considering, vast changes here can occur within even one generation.

2186,,"I specifically said ""in my experience"" for that exact reason. You may have a valid argument if I implied this was a fact in all cases. However, I made it very clear that my statement was based upon pure anecdotal evidence. Why are you so determined to be combative over such a non-issue, anyway? In my observations, that, indeed, is usually the case. That's strictly *my* reality. If you've observed and/or personally experienced differently, that is strictly *your* reality. It doesn't make either of us entirely right or wrong, nor does it suggest that the scenario described in the OP is purely a fabrication that never happens. I was offering a different perspective on the point in the discussion which is based on a false premise; that all single mothers are proud to be single mothers and shamelessly flaunt such a status. 

There are multiple causes of single motherhood where praising said mothers for raising their children alone is appropriate. The example I listed  in my original post is common in my community. Right below that is the father being murdered. Right below that is the father being imprisoned. All of these examples were caused by either the fathers themselves or third parties. The single mothers who manage to raise their kids alone when faced with these situations deserve to be encouraged for it.

On the flip side, single fathers get special attention as well because they go against a negative stereotype that fathers turn deadbeat when they separate from the mothers of their children. They also receive well-deserved praise if they raise their children due to the mother being an addict, imprisoned, or dead. There are many variables to these situations, and frankly, I find it crass and myopic to paint all single mothers with a broad brush because of this."

Guys. Am I missing something here? This sub states it's for focusing on independant male life, not for focusing on women, and yet here is another shitpost about johnny Depp's girlfriend.

I'm thinking every time some OP who isnt an obvious alt account or troll breaks the rules, I lock the post, and then give OP 24 hours to post something about how mgtow is helping their life. With a positive perspective, or take a ban that gives them enough time to think something up. 

I'm serious... this is NOT a carbon copy or refugee camp for men who want to lay claim to being ""mgtow"" and just spending their time bitching and complaining about women. 

THINK about what mgtow is doing for you to make YOU better. Then post that. You can talk about where YOU used to be when you were blue pulled, and you can relate that to where you are now that you are a mgtow. 

That's what this sub is for, and constantly removing posts and saying ""refer to sub rules"" is not being as effective as I'd like in promoting the content this sub was meant to showcase.

Hell, I actually don't see anything wrong with having a romantic or sexual relationship with women.

To me, that is the whole idea behind MGTOW- having the courage to do what is right for you regardless of societal expectations.

I would say guys do it to but they are either assholes or being sarcastic and will let you know right away. But even the assholes are rather rare in doing this because they know such behavior could lead to an asswhupping or at least people not wanting to hang around them.

Some single women seem to think they are above society's niceness as though they were a celebrity. They see nothing wrong shit testing their host despite the obvious rudeness of it all.

However there is another reason for it as well. They think being a bitch makes them more attractive because they have been picked up by guys who were jerks to them. It's a reversal of expectations. Girls are used to guys being nice to them so they take it for granted. When a decent looking guy comes along and doesn't kiss her ass, she thinks he must be on a higher tier therefore she finds him more attractive than the nice guys. 

Guys are more used to women being bitches to them or at least cold and indifferent. Guys are just likely to be put out by a bitchy woman either getting angry or losing their self esteem. The guys not phased by it are the usual pump&dumpers whom the girls later will claim they are tired of due to all the ghosting."

This is extremely true. I don't come from a background of having been screwed over, my marriage never had time to go bad. So i never developed the personal distaste. Thus, i don't avoid women at all except the part of being alone with one.   


But i do see that the more attractive ones are the ones that can't in the least understand why they're not wrapping me around their finger.   


To be honest, If i would say that I have a ""type"" these days.. even though i don't engage.. It would be the plain janes. They are usually much more relaxed about things.

They want to feel like they've made a guy their little chump, to manipulate.
I'd say its quite fashionable for the female to have a little pussy-begger-slave behind her as I see this sort of behavior quite frequently. In my opinion, it gets her respect and jealousy from the others in the female collective or ""hivemind"". This phenomena seems to be quite ubiquitous these days, given the emasculating soy boy producing society we live in."

And despite my username an excellent father as well haha. We've been talking divorce because despite doing well I just haven't had the ""passion"" she craves. Kinda hard to be passionate when she won't even touch me.  But I do speak her love language which is gift giving and words of affirmation. It just hasn't been doing anything. I told her maybe talking divorce would ignore that spark in me to want that from happening. How could I fear losing her and divorce if we didn't go through with it? And it did. Started researching and man...fuck I just don't want to do it lol. I know id be settling and that's a bitch thing to do but I just want to be absolutely sure for the sake of our child.

Well come to find out she's been cheating on me. Just found out last week actually. I don't know all the nittty gritty details and honestly I just don't care or need to know..I know all I need to know which is to get the fuck out while I can. 2 wrongs don't make a right and we both have contributed to making a shitty situation

So yeah...I just have zero fucks to give right now. We're going through with divorce and keeping it amicable. We're going mediation route, no lawyers. We make the same amount and want to split everything evenly which I'm cool with.

I'm just a bit scared in how I'll survive on just my income. Family is a state away. Ill be ok just may have to do some side gigs or get a 2nd job and figure out if renting an apartment or owning a condo/townhome would be best for me. A lot to think over.

2251,Heisenbergeffect,"Here's some things that helped me early on.   


Set up a home, make it your way and start living in it like YOU want to. But, my one big advice is this. Keep it clean. There is nothing that can bring your spirits down like a messy home, and once it gets really messy, the task of cleaning it seems bigger and bigger. It took a long time before I managed to pull myself together and start doing this right. But it made a huge difference in how i felt about myself. As well as being able to open the front door and not be embarrassed. I was in a long slump and my house was a total mess.   


Don't live to impress, get only the home you need. There's only 5 people in the world that actually care about your home, the rest are either ok with whatever you have or jealous. And you don't need jealousy in your life.   


Wealth protection before generation. Pay off your debts, even if it sucks. Don't start to try and invest etc until you have your debt situation well under control. ESPECIALLY high interest debt. a 19% credit card is a much better investment to pay off than the stock market. And once you start owning things that other people have payments on, you'll see how much money that actually is. I couldn't believe how much money I was able to save once I had no more payments. Even though I understood it theoretically, the feeling once you see the numbers start adding up in your accounts is pretty powerful.   


And above all else. One day at a time, nothing happens immediately."
2252,ValhallaBoundBoy,You're getting full / majority custody?
2253,MementoMordor,"They can't help it. It's in their DNA to test potential partners, they are not bad people. Just be aware.
In your case, she probably saw you as a provider of some sort. They have different rules for this and the ones they really want. 
Maybe you are soft or you got played by her or yourself. Learn, accept, adapt! (sounded like a self help book there :))"
2254,Uniqueinsult,"Well this is how the story goes these days man. I woke up at 17 after dating a crazy young woman, tested the waters of a relationship again at 18. Conclusion: weird world we are living in."

Fortunately I'm debt free. Unbeknownst to me my wife wracked up quite a bit of debt over the past few years. I might have some responsibility with that which sucks but you're right I will get whatever comes my way cleaned up first. I don't know much about investing anyways I do have a 401k going which is good tho"

This is something women will pick up on rather easily, where you may not have. If he meant that, it's a hint. If not, a diss."
2266,iluvfrostidflaks,"i see your point. if thats what he meant then i’ll apologize for my other comments, but it really looks more like some random sneaky insult. and the point of what i said earlier is that these sort of tests and other asshole behavior won’t get women very far with men unless they find one who is willing to put up with it. in my case most of it was unwarranted and i stood up for myself early on after noticing a pattern of totally unwarranted bs. thats when she took off. lol."

No, not a healthy meal but guess what?  It is a HELLUVA improvement from what you were eating.  That's how progress works.  Later, you'll replace your first can of coke with water.  But for now, pat yourself on the back for improving.

If you focus on the goal, you are indeed ""low value"".  However, if you focus on the PATH (which I am a believer of), you are actually high value because you are following the Way.  A man who looks to improve and acts upon it?  He is nothing short of nobility.

You're fucking awesome man. You've accepted where you are, accepted how society works and accepted that YOU, not others, are the change that needs to happen.

I say GOOD FOR YOU MAN. I've been down in low value territory and I'm heading there again with my life choices. Higher value people who are consistent don't often appreciate how HARD it is to climb out of a rut. But, those of us who have done it DO KNOW.

If a good and truly high value woman comes along, with whom you're properly compatible with and you two can work synergistically as a good team, all the better. 

Also have you considered fasting? Amazing benefits if you can stand it, whether intermittently or prolonged.

I really feel identified with you because i spent a lot of time through my adolescence and early 20's  thinking i was a cool guy, but i didn't take care of my own hygiene. i weighed 100 pounds(Lol i know i was skinny AF). and i always blamed it on other people about my own failures.

1 year ago i began to grow a beard, hit the gym and eat properly, and i've realised that people respect me more and i really feel good about myself, i didn't even do it because of external acceptance, but rather self love and self improvement."

2292,bladeofgrass90,"If you are concerned with weight, you're in the perfect part of the internet to find help. There are quite a few subreddits here that'll surely be helpful. 

Before that, are you lazy? If it's a YES, then we have something in common. Are you cheap? If it's a YES, then we have something in common. Do you not like exercise at the moment? If it's a YES, Then we have something again in common.

 Are you determined? If there answer is YES then here are a few subbreddits to help you out r/intermittentfasting, r/fasting, r/OMAD. There have been countless videos and articles on the internet of people that have had great success with Intermittent Fasting (IF). I have. Take a look at the before and after progress pics in both r/fasting and r/intermittentfasting.

Visit those subbreddits, reply here or private message me, I'd be happy to help if anyway I can. There's numerous positive benefits of IF; loosing weight is almost like one of the minor benefits but it's the main reason most are attracted to it. I've been doing it almost a year now; it's a lifestyle.

Here's an animated video about Water fasting/ Fasting to get some points across: [https://youtu.be/DghrZNUP5vo](https://youtu.be/DghrZNUP5vo)

Trust me, it's worth the watch.

Adding exercise to the melting pot only  expedites the process. Exercise is tough to get into but I like to compare it to taking a shower. At first you don't wanna get into the water but when you do, it's difficult to leave it. It's in NO WAY NECESSARY to loose weight but it gets you to the goal quicker.

Change is difficult but admitting that you need to change is already a step in the right direction.

Side note: I am new to Reddit (was a lurker until recently) so I don't know if linking other subbreddits is fine or not so please let me know anyone.."

Plants don't grow up to the light of the sun, to spite the darkness of their beginnings as seeds in soil. They are doing it to grow. And so you are growing towards the light of your potential. 

You have given yourself credit; so what would condemning yourself, really do?

Well done!"

2297,MajIssuesCaptObvious,"You're off to a great start. Oftentimes, working on our physical/health shortcomings leads to greater things. In fact, a study showed that exercise had a more positive affect on young boys' confidence than receiving high marks in school. I'm sure that has an affect on adults as well. 

Don't stop there, though. Being an overall high value person TO YOURSELF means also exercising your brain. Read books that offer positive information on personality, psychology, confidence, and even finance so you can be well rounded. Not get books on how to manipulate people or get rich quick junk. Even if you read 3 books a year, that's a lot more information than you had the year before. 

Good luck, man, and congrats on the forward momentum. Stay on that shit!"
2298,avtarius,"When using the term ""value"", you have to understand relative value.

When thots are brainwashed into thinking ""they're worth it"", ""I deserve better"", etc. without understanding the real ecosystem, anyone can be a ""low value man"".

But that's them, their label for anyone they don't choose. Are you really low value ? Or were you tricked into thinking you're low value ?

2301,Bluejuju543,"Sugar creates the same dopamine spike as cocaine.  It is addictive. I think of sugar addiction like smoking, I've seen how tough it is to quite smoking, well sugar is no different.  The fact you already lowered your cola intake I think is a win.

Too much sugar and other refined carbs will keep your insulin levels high and make it tough to loose weight.  Insulin tells your fat cells to store energy (you want them to release energy) and it also blocks Leptin from working in your brain.  Leptin is what makes you feel full and is created by your fat cells.  If sugar wasn't screwing up the harmonies as you put weight on you would naturally just start feeling full sooner and eat less.

I started at 340 as well and by following a non strict keto diet and fasting I dropped to 260 in like 6 months.  I am currently hanging around 285 but then I do eat too much sugar/refined carbs currently.  It's not all about calorie reduction, hormones play a huge factor too (more then just insulin and leptin).

Some good sources are Jason Fung, Robert Lustig, Tim Noakes.  You can find books or if you are like me there are youtube videos of presentations and interviews.

You can become the man you want to be without the burden of alimony, child support and other impediments. If given a choice of having to   work off a hundred pounds or suffer for decades from imploding marriage, I'd choose the former. Please don't make an effort to do this to get a woman; out of the frying pan into the fire. 

From personal experience: your task is like rolling a giant boulder. It will take a lot of exausting energy to get it rolling and seem futile. Make the effort your goal, not the results. Do this and you'll one day notice  that the boulder is rolling under it's own inertia and pulling you along. Health, fitness and personal growth will feel better than anything you've experienced."

2323,rakeshkook,"The first achievement in life must always be proper food, good exercise and good sleep. If a man doesn't take care of these, whatever he achieves in life is utterly useless.

These are simple things and yet is very hard for most people. These are routine things that if done well greatly enhance your physique and energy levels which improve your mindset which improves your overall success in life.

Eating a consistent healthy meals properly spaced out and making a promise that you cook your meals as much as everyday till you are habituated to it that you do not want outside food. Cooking is a valuable skill that must be taught to every kid otherwise you will be lazy and start looking for fast junk food that ends up doing more damage to you..

Always making sure having good sleep. Yes. Here needs discipline. You go to sleep and wake up at same time as much as possible everyday,. This also requires discipline.

Always making sure you get to walk and do few strength training exercises and bit of yoga and meditation combined. This also requires bit of self-discipline.

If you can consistently do this everyday, you are already a great achiever in life. Your physique will be manly, perfect and energetic.

Remember you are not low value. Just that you did not have proper direction in life and that is okay. It can always be changed gradually. It is tough but it can be done.

Just as with anything, our minds also should be managed. Most people let their minds road around and stressed and anxious which leads to addictions, illness and other self-destructive habits. One must learn to know what is important and what is not important, what is essential to one's life and what is not essential. Then let your mind work around these principles. Your thoughts also will align with these values. And you will see that your mind will actually start working for you rather than against you. Mind is awesome power. If you think low value, it feeds back on itself and your body and mind will work to make low value through depression and feelings of low self-esteem. Do not worry about what others may perceive you. Rather change how you perceive yourself even if you are fat, you can start seeing yourself more positively rather than negatively.

Instead of society defining you and validating you, rather validate yourself from inside. seek validation and value from inside of you. It helps you keep peace and happiness no matter the outer circumstances.

You need not achieve big things in life to feel better. All you need to do is take care of yourself properly without falling into addictions, self-destructive habits and behaviors. This - self-reliance -  is itself a big achievement. It is smaller things that you do each day that make your life meaningful and purposeful. If done well, it adds up and makes you feel great and better about yourself."

2326,bambambam10,"Low value man is a term women coined since they size up based on looks, money, etc.  The term low value man should not exist in your own vocabulary.  there are only two types of men you should think about.  There are weak men and strong men. If you are weak, know that you can become strong through hard work and humility. If you are strong, stay humble, remember what it took to become strong to stay strong.  Fortify both your physical and mental.  You should never put yourself down, and call yourself low value.  You are a man that has room to improve, that is all.  Value is subjective... who is validating your value? Is it you?  Are you saying you are low value because that's how women perceive you?  Clinging on to your value as a man, based on someone else's opinion is the worst thing you could do. Learn to reject external validation. You do not need this. 

Know that you are accountable for every decision you make for yourself and no one else is doing that for you.  If you listen to someone else's suggestions, it is you who is accepting this.   If you decide to eat food you want to eat, that's also on you.  You make these decisions.  

The most important thing you can do for yourself is understand how your own mind works and how you can convince yourself to be what you want to be.  When you're chasing your goals, never half ass, always put 100% effort, persist and don't give up when you make mistakes.

In my case, the main problem was literally buying too much food, I would eat it all quickly and then go back to the store a few days later to buy too much again. I was spending like $600 a month on groceries alone, which I now halved. Impose a restricted food budget upon yourself so you don't buy more than you need, and save the rest.

I was addicted to sugary drinks too, so I switched to diet soda. Well, I'm still addicted, but at least it's 0 cal. I can drink 2 liters in a day if I want to and it's still gonna be 0 cal. I always buy a bunch of 12-packs whenever they go on sale. This is the one and only thing I don't limit myself for; helps me cope with the constant hunger pangs. So far so good."

The whole idea about this shutdown is to keep the numbers manageable so that if we do see more cases we can handle them.

2472,Rascal_Blacktail,I’d also argue that farenheit 451 is more applicable as well. Everyone focuses on the government surveillance in 1984 but never the self censorship and self submission found in Fahrenheit 451. I find that book to be far more prophetic with society’s current sensibilities
2473,NathanHollister,"So? How long should society be shut down for? Because as soon as the shutdown ends, cases immediately start to skyrocket again. The virus is going to run its course, either now or after the quarantine ends. Why delay it?

2502,30203forever,"Yep. If there was only one thing to remember about women (and the primate females in general: Thank you David Attenborough!) it's that they are biologically amoral.

2504,Hawgster,After being betrayed and divorced. Still losing so much financially to it every month. I don't think I care to find a woman ever again. Just look forward to the rare times when I can get my kids. Pretty much what I live for at this point.
2505,GlobalAsshat,"That's really the way to do it. You hear that old cliche that you have to love yourself before you can love someone else. Life goes in a natural progression where important skills are built as you grow up and a lot of people get fucked up in childhood by not having good parents, a good father figure, or a good circle of friends, and that fucks up their personality, so they end up socially awkward, lacking the ability to hold an interesting conversation or make people laugh or in general small talk, and for men this really gives them a big disadvantage with women and life in general if they can't fix it.

Social-proofing is by far the most important skill to have in life. It's one of the essential skills that leads to a stepping stone to bigger things in life. A large majority of men have varying levels of beta in them but the ones who don't grow up socially well adjusted really end up being the ""creeps"" of society. There's also the matter of having no father figure and an overprotective, coddling mother... I've seen examples of what happens to kids with this situation, still living with grandma at age 40.. nice enough guys but never really pushed to be independent in any way. Women can get away with this because men are always chasing and ""saving"" them, but for men this will lead to a feeling of unfulfillment because men are biologically wired to want to achieve greatness."
2506,CDAYt,"Women? Bah! I’m chasing money fam.

2512,Traveler11819,"what's the old saying?

You will lose a lot of money chasing women.. but you won't lose women chasing money"
2513,rockstarsheep,"No matter what anyone says, your biology is going to predispose you towards wanting to mate. At a certain age, when your sex hormones kick in, and you have a sex drive, as sure the moon exerts an influence on the tides - you are going to feel a pull towards whatever is your sexual preference. That's just Nature / Life at work. It's an undeniable fact, for most people. 

Unfortunately, this can play havoc with you. And it does; for men and women. As this sub is focused on men and men's issues, we focus on that. In a way, ""MGTOW"" or ""GYOW"" is really a form of transcendency. That is to say, to transcend your natural drives; master them and shape them, so you create a form of life that suits you best. That's really just the beginning though. 

Over time, you change as a man. Your testosterone levels go up, peak, and then come down. Many men, mellow out, with time and age. They are less aggressive or seek to be less dominant over others. And a whole host of other changes.

There's inherently wrong with having different kinds of relationships with people. In fact, you need to relate and work with many different kinds of people over your life time. Men and Women, have been trying to figure each other out for who knows how long. Perhaps since the dawn of time. We form complex relationships with each other; whether it's family, friends or lovers. Some are long term relationships and some are short term. We all make mistakes; every single one of us. It's how we work towards resolving them, which counts more than anything else. Unfortunately we live in a very strange time, where there is a sort meaning vacuum and people are just super confused. A lot of ""traditional"" ideas, have been thrown away, being considered old fashioned, useless and meaningless. However, that can't all be true though. 

* Dignity
* Trust
* Faithfulness
* Honour
* Responsibility
* Integrity

Are these values and virtues, really to be thrown in the trashcan? I don't think so. 

And really, finding someone to really bond with, is incredibly, if not the most difficult thing to achieve. It does seem like a fairytale. I can maybe count three couples, over the course of the last almost half-century, that I consider to have a really good, mutually beneficial relationship. The next segment is okay, to not so great and then there's a vast gulf of just mediocre, to terrible and then awful. But it is indeed possible to find someone decent. How, when and where? Nobody can answer that. 

And my friend, the only thing set in stone is that you are born and that you will die. Everything is up for grabs. Probabilities and possibilities; you just don't know. The likelihood of better results, depends on you and the decisions that you make. You may need to take your time and work hard at yourself and those you allow in to your inner world. You probably will. 

The only ""advice"" I can give is to vet everyone in your inner world. Make sure that they add to your world and you add to theirs. More than likely the emptiness you feel, probably really has nothing to do with women as such, but about the meaning and purpose that you are going to give and find in your life. Seek that out first, and everything else can fit in around that."
2514,starfox863,Good for you
2515,Erwinblackthorn,"Women don't fill the void. They chain us to decrease our options. That's why they are called the old ball and chain.

Think about trying to travel somewhere. First you need permission from your bank, to see if you have the money. Then you need permission from your job, so you don't get fired. Then you need permission from the government to see if you have a visa. Then you need permission from the airline to see if you have a plane that will take you. Then after all that, you need permission from the girl.

She's at the top of the permission pyramid. The one factor that doesn't even involve the actual travel process, and this is the one that has top priority. And if you don't please that one, your trip becomes a miserable mess that you paid for.

That's the kind of stuff that makes us go ""why the hell do I bother adding that extra factor, when it doesn't even please me? What are my options?""

I know the options: hand, porn, hoe. HPH, or HPP if you want to pay for a prostitute."
2516,copper_blood,Also make sure your new girlfriend has a life too.
2517,Aszourus,"Saying the point of MGTOW is to not have a girlfriend is thinking with the original r/MGTOW mentality. Not all women are the same just like not all men are pigs. AWALT is a childish concept.
There are still women who submit to their men and are mother and caretaker figures who don't mind life being that way, these women are also hated by feminists. There's even women who actively have been fighting for men's rights before you guys even knew of this whole movement so be a little adult and logical and realize that while the majority of women all think the same there's always an exception to the rule.
Saying stuff like this is just like feminists saying all men cheat and all men are toxic.
MGTOW is putting yourself first, learning to recognize the toxic women and avoid them, doing what you want on your terms. If she wants to be in your life there's sacrifices she should make. And just like people said here, don't settle with anyone in any way that makes them entitled to take your shit from you. Be the best version for yourself that you can be, and don't let any woman stand in your way. If she doesn't like it that way then she can take the highway."
2518,bassheadstang,"Women are a burden on men, especially when you live with them. 

I’ve done the monk thing and found myself wanting to jump anything that wiggled. /r peopleofwalmart were turning me on. Lol

I’ve done the pump and dump thing and that became a lot of work. 

Tinder hookups come at a price. Bitches be crazy but I did meet a few that are cool. 

I kinda fell into the poly lifestyle and have become what’s known as solo-poly. I don’t live with women or commit to one woman. I’ve actually had a few at the same time recently. They have nesters that do all the bf/husband shit and I’m just the swinging dick. I currently have 5 on a rotation. They feed me and clean my house and drain my balls. I don’t have to do shit. They have no reason to lie yet some still can’t help it. It’s pretty sweet over all but you have to know women."
2519,neri_Skabadu,Both people should be in a right place for a relationship so if you're not ready never rush into it because it can ruin you. I know too many people who got heartbroken and burned just cause they were desperate. Live your best life and then if there's still some place for love find someone.
2520,ThePanther1989,Absolutely right...having a girlfriend/ wife doesn't make life better automatically... sometimes it just makes things worse!

2526,soelc3,"> Women can get away with this because men are always chasing and ""saving"" them, but for men this will lead to a feeling of unfulfillment because men are biologically wired to want to achieve greatness.

And maybe this is a part of our nature that works against us, an evolutionary baggage we're better off casting aside. By definition, only a minority can achieve greatness, because to be great means to be great relative to someone else. The majority of men are going to lose in the arms race of greatness, just like the majority of men will be betas no matter how much lifting and self-improvement they do, because the game is always graded on a curve. Individual men can rise up and down the hierarchy, but only at the expense of other men, as the 80/20 rule remains in place. What the majority of men need is compassion and a path forward, to self-esteem and self-actualization, that doesn't rely on throwing themselves into Darwin's grinder for a shot at reproduction."
2527,CalmElk,">for men this really gives them a big disadvantage with women and life in general if they can't fix it.

Why do men need to attract women before they can go MGTOW? This sounds like gatekeeping.

> Social-proofing is by far the most important skill to have in life. It's one of the essential skills that leads to a stepping stone to bigger things in life.

Why do I need to care about the rat race? I just want to go my own way.

People should love themselves but they shouldn't have to attract women and reach the top of society to prove their value."
2528,avtarius,The point of MGTOW is playing the game on your own terms ... Not all MGTOW are monks
2529,1st10Amendments,"AIUI, the point to MGTOW is to avoid entangling interactions with females; by which I mean no LTR in one’s personal life and to be VERY careful in one’s business dealings with women. 

For some MGTOW, a STR MAY be a risk worth taking, but NOT to cohabitate or to intermingle finances in any way. 

For others, it may mean Monk Mode, whether that’s be for a short term or permanently. 

Other than that, MGTOW is about self-actualization and personal growth. 

But I could be wrong. YMMV."

2543,rockstarsheep,"Thank you for your kindness, my friend. Believe it or not, I haven't directly done this. 

Through some of my other comments, there are glimmers of the truth. To put a finer point on things; no, I haven't. I suppose if I might be able to help others, then I could be persuaded to discuss my blunders and the insights I have derived from them. Truly it is a treasure trove of what not to do, and occasionally a nugget of wisdom. 

What have I started, very slowly, is to create some YouTube content. It's not specifically MGTOW, but it is related to finding and living in a meaningful way. Believe it or not, I have some training as a therapist, so it integrates some of that. 

Now, if you have a particular subject that you find important and might want me to write on, I would be happy to consider it as a contribution here. What do you think?"
2544,Aszourus,"Exactly.

We spend years spoiling the shit out of women, meeting every single expectation they have and then complain about them being spoiled. Works the same as with your kids. You raise them to be people to get everything they want asking as they beg or cry for it they are going to grow up to be pieces of sh*t who don't know the worth if anything and are used to being spoiled."
2545,MajIssuesCaptObvious,"You can have a gf, just don't give her legal rights to what you've worked for by cohabitation, marriage, or having a kid."
2546,TheVineyard1996,It's about not having a woman dictate your life. If we want romantic exclusivity and sexual fidelity then that is fine as long as it is on our OWN terms. Understand? We aren't priests nor trying to be James Bond sleeping with every woman we see. It's about going on your own path regardless if society wants us to or not.
2547,Frinkst21,"The exclusivity is a non-issue to me. The issue is men are expected to adapt and give up so much for their partner which is why they feel so lost after a break-up.

More people, and more importantly, young men are increasingly becoming conscious of this, which is why we see a large shift in dating strategies and the masses abandoning the olds traditional ways."
2557,rockstarsheep,"Pick something that is relevant to you. That always makes it easier. 

You have touched on a very interesting subject though. In fact this might be something to explore. What is it though? 

There is no *summa summarum*; which means. There is a sum of all sums. A coherent system of hypotheses; whether these are ideas that come to us from the sciences, philosophy or any of the other humanities - that neatly folds things together. At least not in this particular subject. 

It would then appear, that there is no central theme, beyond the very narrow confines of such ideas as - hypergamy^•. 

^•= I call to attention, the notion of hypergamy, because it is one of the bedrock concepts of RP ideology, as it relates to the nature of women; and for two reasons. 

The first is that it might very well be a retrospective projected idea, less than what reality actually is, in itself. Some academic work has begun to actually interrogate this concept, and it would appear, that it may not be completely true in an absolute sense. 

Now, this is not unusual. Often, with knowledge, and the discovery of it, we can at times, mislabel certain phenomena, because we either do not understand it.  Or, out of convenience, impose a definition that is meant to be temporary, but through common use, becomes the standard definition. 

That is to say, it may indeed be incorrect. This poses a problem to someone like Rollo Tomassi, Richard Cooper and a whole slew of others, who have purchased their position of authority on either, misinformation, disinformation, or pure chicanery. They have a vested interest in maintaining and defending their position, because, in one way or another, their relevance and in some cases, their income relies on this. They have a vested interest in their truth, as it pays them to do so. They have an incentive here, which also stretches further in to the lives of those who take their thoughts, opinions and insights as incontrovertible truth. 

As no one has risen to the challenge, or indeed opportunity, to test the hypothesis of hypergamy as such, the idea and those who advocate it, have been safe in their assumptions. However, this is slowly changing. There may be an element of truth to it, however, it may also be, that it has been starkly over emphasised. 

Just recently, Shawn T. Smith; a highly trained and capable psychologist, has very politely, questioned hypergamy. And it with some interest that I watched Rollo squirm, as the headlights of professional rigour and experience, started to question, what really might be a pet theory at best and pure speculation at worst. 

Rollo has the gift of the gab, and can twine a word salad of concepts and ideas, in order to muddy the water. He can, as a fall back, cling to the notion of the stories he has heard from others, and use this as proof. Now, there may be some truth, in the stories of others, but there is such a lack of sophistication in terms of definitions and the collection of data, for the purposes of deriving some sort of truth; that cottage wisdom will do ... for now. 

That is not to victimise or lionise him. We all make judgments of error, and believe in incorrect assessments. Every one of us. It just gets highly amplified when a personal misgiving is transmitted to a broader audience, that then accepts it as unquestionable truth. The concept may require some calibration, however, that may cause the invalidation of some of the key premises. 

We will see if the truth is more important than the individual, in good time. 

Now, the second part is this. 

The nature of men. I have yet to encounter a term, such as hypergamy, when it relates to the *innate nature of men*. I am quite confident that the feminists would clamber to screech out the term; Patriarchy! 

Laughable as that is, it is still a very powerful concept at play in our world. It is at best, a shorthand summary to describe how women have been exploited and victimised for the benefit of men. Now, before I descend in to that pit of hell, I'll stop. And continue as such.

Men **and** Women can behave themselves in less than ideal ways. Both sexes can be destructive, shameless, thoughtless, cruel and otherwise indifferent. On the reverse of this, both sexes can be creative, remorseful, thoughtful, kind and interested. Some men **and** women, can exhibit more or less of the above. And we can further narrow things down. 

Moving on; some men are not particularly fantastic human beings. They can exhibit some of the lesser qualities that they're accused of, but to wholesale clump everyone together, is a massive mistake. This also brings in to question, the measure or measures by which we want to judge men or women. Who is deriving the score card, and how are they keeping score? What are they enumerating and quantifying, for the purposes of judgment. Nobody really seems to know. It is taken as a given. 

There are no easy to grasp values to use, but general concepts of acceptable behaviour. They in themselves can be horrible stereotypes, or indeed, truths. 

So, we seem to lack a critical framework, by which to evaluate and comment on the nature  of men and women. Beyond the tropes of; ""Lift and make bank!"" 

My little conclusion is this. We need to be critical of accepted wisdoms, or apparent truths, and not go with face value agreements of their validity. We need to have proper discussions to explore the ideas that we have been given. To me, that is an essential part of going your own way; responsibility for the evaluation of information, for the purpose of defining a set of values that you can live a good life by. 

A very big problem to overcome, is the demands of immediacy. Now, now, now. Most good things, do not come about in the - *right here and now*. They take time to cultivate. It takes work. It requires some humility, patience and courage. And most of all, it demands honesty. That my good friend, is quite difficult to achieve. And it is a problem that has been with us, for a very long time.

So, there you go! My little thoughts for the day. Thank you for your kindness and I hope that you are keeping and doing well."
2558,Aszourus,"I am talking about also our responsibility, you say media as if it's an entity of its own run by itself. Let me remind you most big media corporations are run by men themselves. So yes we have been digging our own graves for years. The existence of simps should be proof enough that enough men keep catering to women and in turn making then expect that kind of behaviour from everyone. and BTW I'm not the op, I'm not chasing any dragon. I am a happily single man doing my thing. But that doesn't mean I am not reasonable or logical enough to realize that you can not neither man or women 100% all in one group and say ALL of these people are the same. Believing that is plain ignorant, even though j agree there aren't many women who are different."

Sorry dog lovers -- I tried getting a dog and it just didn't do it for me.

It is possible to get plenty of physical affection without sex, romantic love, or commitment, via professional cuddlers. If that had been available to me in the past, it would have saved me a lot of depressive episodes and other disasters in my life."

The reason is that, for the past several years, we've seen nothing but all these stories about how ""science shows"" that men ""need"" sex and female companionship to be ""healthy.""

There are still some who are sticking by that, like the Campaign Against Sex Robots woman.  I've also seen some pushback against that from the femmstappo, specifically the whole complaint about the tendency for men to be ""emotional golddiggers"" on their wives, and that the wives need to be compensated for the ""unpaid emotional labor"" of loving their husbands...or...something...

Which means that more and more people, I think, are going to come around to our point of view.  And if folks like Sprankle won't, the feminists surely will, when they actually think about this ""need for human companionship"" and ""empathy,"" and realize the implications for them."

2646,NakedValhallaBoyyy,I'm pretty sure I'm getting laid tomorrow.
2647,evilpigclone,"Watching more ducktales (2017) the nostalgia is amazing. Also scrooge is literally the embodiment of mgtow. Filthy rich, went on amazing adventures his whole life. No long term relationships to hold him back. Got some awesome nephews and an adopted niece to take on adventures and fill the family/parental gap."
2648,Dead_Art,Probably going to cook homemade Tonkotsu Ramen for my bro's and hit a few bars with whoever wants to go out. I need to start reclaiming some of my old haunts from she who will not be named
2649,Zbbroxx,"I'm going to watch the Barnum and Bailey shit show that is Valentine's Day at the gym. 

Watch a gym full of thirsty dudes flock to the one lone female in the gym until the staff starts throwing them out. 

I'm placing the over under at 10. Last year 12 dudes got tossed out and the year before was 8."
2650,30203forever,I'll do absolutely nothing out of ordinary to signify it. Non serviam.
2651,goat-head-man,"Friday is the first day of my weekend. Stay home, spend some quality time with my dogs, cook a good meal, read a few more chapters of ""The Art of War"" by Sun Tzu (an interesting study of tactics that can be applied to work, business, even social interaction).
Possibly do some winter cleaning on the 4x4 so its ready for spring. Cheers!"

2658,starzwillsucceed,I'll be programming my Virtual Reality Racing game I'm making for the Oculus Quest.
2659,ZeusTheSeductivEagle,"Hanging out with my long distance ""gf"" I see her like once a month for the weekend. I said I would end it when it got complicated. It's been 5 years."
2660,Impossible-asset,"Tomorrow is Valentines day. 

I call it Ballentines day, (an ENTIRELY underrated scotch, fellas. I mean no shit, its GOOD).

So I treat myself usually by getting dressed up, I buy myself a long-stem rose and go to a steak house. I'll have a scotch (most places have at least a couple good selections). And I'll have a big fat porterhouse. I have beer with my porterhouse. Good Dark beer. Then I pay my bill and leave. But heres the twist. I leave the OTHER rose that I dried over the mantle for a year on the table, and take the new one home to dry. I put it in the mantle over the fireplace to dry out in the coming year. Yes I do this, yes its kindof stupid, and I enjoy it immensely.

I take the bill for the evening and I total up the cost of the scotch, meal, and uber to and from the steakhouse, and then I double it and put that extra amount (I would have spent on a dste) into my stock funds to make interest in the coming year). 

It's a stupid ritual I've done for the past 10 years or so. It just reminds me of how short-lived a valentines day celebration can be, and when I look at the rose that's drying on the mantle, I think of the money that is making me interest instead of just being gone. 

Sunday I'll be getting myself a nice young Korean whore in DC for a couple hours to enjoy, my dose of eros for the quarter.  

Then I'll kick back with some more ballentines on the rocks, and some good english tobacco from my grandfather's pipe, and enjoy picking my guitar on the back deck and watch the sun silhouette the hills before dipping behind them. 

Love yourself. Treat yourself, have a tasteful reminder of what you walked away from, and associate it with your increasing wealth as you do something for your own, pure enjoyment. 

That's what I'm doing on ballentines day weekend."
2661,Straightouttajakku12,Gonna try a new boba place with my Valentine before they go to work that day. Other than that just enough my bomb-ass chocolates and watch some x-files.
2662,DJDickJob,"I'll celebrate by not celebrating stupid fucking imaginary made-up holidays. Just drinking beer and listening to loud ass music like I always do, and playing with my insane little shithead puppy and maybe give her some extra food. 

Sorry ladies, my dog is cooler than you. Buy your own chocolate."

2674,MajIssuesCaptObvious,"Work in the morning, fix someone's car (for pay), install a new dish washer, then spend time with my son...

2710,PubliusVirgilius,"I like the idea with putting the amount that you would spend on a woman on a date, aside in savings!

And you definitely know how to treat yourself and enjoy life. 

I think most people dont know how to enjoy small things in live, like a good drink, food in your own company.

What tobacco do you smoke?
I also love to smoke pipe tobacco and collect/smoke pipes."

2724,Zbbroxx,"My gym is phenomenal. This is the one night a year it's like this. 

Most of these guys are the ones that remember that gym membership they have and never use. They figure it's a good place to find a woman. 

Since most of the bodybuilders and other powerlifters are out doing their thing and the boys that are there won't go near an actual barbell I can hog the deadlift platform without screwing with someone else's training."
2725,starzwillsucceed,"Right now I'm just prototyping because I just started learning how to make games in Oculus which I'm actually still waiting for since there was a back order.

Thanks for the ask though!"
2726,Impossible-asset,"I smoke on occassion more out of fond memories if my grandfather and my uncle. Both of them smoked a LOT of cigars and cigarettes, but brought their pipes out on special occassions and when they would play cards and sip whiskey. 

I was a little kid and watching the activity was like watching a meeting of the Gods. No women allowed, and no kids while the men were conversing amongst themselves. 

My grandfather's pipe is an old Hungarian type with a flat bottom so it sits and doesnt roll about. My uncle favored an old meershaum pipe. They both came to me as heirlooms, but I rarely smoke them. I prefer a church warden for cooler smoke and my tobacco of choice is usually something simple like proper english or any old downhill. I dont smoke enough to appreciate the nuances of a particular variety. It's just a good thing I enjoy from time to time to remember those old legendary Italians gathered around the table outside."
2727,Impossible-asset,"I suppose I should clarify the context. 

I was using ""stupid"" as a casual-speech synonym of ""frivolous"". Which I suppose I should have used. 

The little ritual is ""frivolous"" in nature. It's not necessary for me to do in order to stay mgtow, it's just a little something for me that I enjoy for myself."
2728,Straightouttajakku12,Good bot
2729,DJDickJob,And it also doesn't take a genius to look at my comment and realize I never claimed to be a genius.
2730,PubliusVirgilius,Haha  I was just joking. Enjoy!
2731,UnKnownSurviving,"Nice! lol ahaha ha. Just wear a condom. If she resists, forced her to take a condom in her pussy. I think some girls want to go bare, but that’s so dangerous! Don’t do it! I had a girl once, but she was so ugly and fat. Not worth it. I went bare but not for long. Thanks God I didn’t cum in that fat blub of whale fat. 

That sex almost killed me. She was so fat, I didn’t know what I was doing. But she sat on top of me. Nearly suffocated me."
2732,JD-Anderson,It sure has gotten a lot easier to bang the basic ones in the last 10 years or so. I just compliment them on their tattoos.
2733,PubliusVirgilius,Haha exactly
2734,Cfaraway,"Are you actually kidding me?? That's pathetic. Who goes to the gym to chase girls anyway? Oy. Fair play to the staff for tossing their asses, and good on you for hitting the deads & mocking the sad simps."
2735,Straightouttajakku12,Your attitude sure did
2736,NakedValhallaBoyyy,"> That sex almost killed me. She was so fat, I didn’t know what I was doing. But she sat on top of me. Nearly suffocated me.

I don't know why you decided to tell us this, it was not necessary. It's written like the opening hook for a novel."
2737,Confined09,Dear god 🤣
2738,LesterBurnham97,"Do you even believe the BS you wrote?
Bragging about awful sex with a fat ugly girl. Well you still gave it to her! And after banging her you have the guts to complain about something so obvious like her being fat and ugly. Guys like you are the reason MGTOW's are called misogynistic assholes. You present yourself as personified unclassyness.

@Mods: I really know that i am disrespectful to this guy but somebtjings need to be said and i stand by my words and since the first sub got quarantined i really get sick ny guys who show bwhaviour like this here in a sub where we do not want crap like this. The story is not even funny. I take any punishment you see fit for my outburst if anyone reports me."
2739,NewWorldSurvival,Best Reddit comment I've ever read.

2741,bassheadstang,I haven’t paid for a date in years. They usually come right to me. Sometimes faster than dominos. Lol
2742,DJDickJob,"Alright Mr. Internet Mindreader, I don't know where you got your superpowers of interpreting my attitude through a basic ass comment, but my superpowers come in the form of ""block user"" because you're starting to sound like the one with a shitty attitude.

2751,NewWorldSurvival,Fucking too right brother
2752,sandstonexray,This is certainly better than MGTOW1 but if you need a break from tinder bios and snap stories you should probably unplug for a while.
2753,onbakeplatinum,"I get along fine with the women in my life, I just have no interest in dating and find the majority of women out there unappealing, just like I do men. And I like being alone. I wish mgtow2 was named ""mgtows against misogyny"""
2754,CDAYt,"I don’t even believe that some of the people on MGTOW1 genuinely dislike ALL women either. The sub has become a place to aggressively express frustration in poor partners in the past with the name MGTOW attached to it.

People complain about the habits of the gender they’re dating, its entirely natural it doesn’t inherently target every single member of that society. Those guys just need to stop calling themselves Mgtow"
2755,sus_not_sus,You're in the right place brother
2756,poison-fang-blade,I consider myself purple pill and think that the truth is somewhere in the middle. I still feel sexually attracted to them but I don't think that's even worth approaching them with that intention nowadays. I find it hard to connect with the vast majority of them even at a friendship level. Most of them look too boring to me.
2757,ChadManning1989,"r/MGTOW is now just r/Incels rebranded.

&#x200B;

If you have questions, or observations on life in general, r/MGTOW2 is all for it."
2758,ohishitmypantsagain,Many here can attest to being banned from MGTOW1 simply by not blindly adhering to their mantra of woman hate.  Anything exhibited that is slightly less than frothing vitriol and BANNED!
2759,DoctorMartain,"I would take a step back from Tinder and Social media all together , try it for a few days , delete the apps so the notifications dont temp you to take a look."
2760,BunsAreBest,"Not all woman are like that but a lot are. As a woman I talk a lot with other woman. I notice how we can say what ever they want about men. Here’s some not needed examples: I only date tall men, that guys butt is cute, he is suck a dick, any short guy is not a guy. If a guy said any of this about woman, he’s being sexist. We need to get rid of this double standard. It pisses me off so much because woman preach equality yet say this shit. It’s not equal, society is going to turn woman dominated if it continues."
2761,michaelklr,"MGTOW sub is truly the male version of feminists with no logic or reasoning, all MGTOW does is try to control free thought and speech. Mgtow2 is completely different, as in way better. 
I got banned from MGTOW because I asked if they were banning people just like the feminists at FDS that want to control free thought and speech. It was embarrassing to know that the mods at MGTOW were not like us men that have gone our way."
2762,Friendly-Casper,"Word of advice, quit using dating apps.  They're a pox upon society and the people who came up with them should be met with a short stop at the end of a long rope.  I'd also avoid even so much as looking at the OG Mgtow.  How that section has managed to not end up quarantined or banned yet is just a slight bit confusing."
2763,ausgamer529,Not all women are bad. Alot of them that I work with at my job are okay people hell even a few O consider freinds. But there are always ones who you should identify and avoid like the plague. The ones who will ruin someones career just for fun
2764,Yasai101,"Mgtow is just that, going YOUR own way. Whatever that might be."
2765,TheMF-J,Yes it is and I agree with every word you said.  You’ll find this a likeminded place
2766,themightyJG,"i want to believe nawalt, sadly i never met a woman that wasnt like the females they describe on mgtow1 at least at some level."
2767,stephenkodampuly666,"Everyone are not feminazis. Only a few powerful people are feminazis, they are making all the problems in the society. But How many woman did we see fighting against them or speaking against them in public? Little to rare. Maybe they won't know about these things, Who knows? Even if they knew, there is no guarantees that they will speak against it in public. Because whatever these minority feminazis are doing are beneficial for vast majority of the woman. They might say this is a bad situation in a private conversation, that will definitely make them look like an innocent person. Since we rarely see woman speak up against modern feminism, we have to believe that they are content with all these. When woman were not content, they started feminism."
2768,Germantaffer,"In the moment I entered mgtow1 I see the room full of hate, harsh verdicts and was really badly surprised. I think we have really to renegiotate the role models and the modern feminism, that wants to pressure both genders in new negative role models, 
I understand hate, sometimey I feel hate too, but it's not useful. The idea of lying moribund in my bed looking back in my  life and realizing, that is full of hate is a sad idea."
2769,MajIssuesCaptObvious,Nothing else needs to be said.
2770,DojoKanojoCho5,Boom ^^
2771,M26PershingTank,"You would think they will understand female biology and learn to live with it. As long as you don't get involved with them romantically, life can still goes on easily. 
Hell I'm fine with being friendzoned since I still make them pay for their own food, movies etc. No romantic attachments. 



Mgtow1 is stuck in this never ending red pill rage. It's time for them to walk away and enjoy life. I understand women today aren't the house wives they're hyped up to be, but it's not a big deal. Go your own way."
2772,DonMelbourne,"> I don’t even believe that some of the people on MGTOW1 genuinely dislike ALL women either. The sub has become a place to aggressively express frustration in poor partners in the past with the name MGTOW attached to it.

I call it ""red pill rabies"", where someone expresses hyperbolic anger against women, and others support him, actually validating the person's anger. It isn't healthy. MGTOW is a positive statement for individual ownership. ""MGTOW is freedom"" is so true. That's why I like this sub. Now go, my brother, live your life and don't worry about MGTOW1 anymore!"
2773,Fobilas,"Exactly.  I imagine most people feel very protective of themselves after a horrible breakup.  They become cynical of the opposite sex. It's not displaying strength. They did not adapt as well as others to a common tragedy in life.  In this way, the mgtow1 mentality is a mental health problem. 

I think mgtow1 is legit hate/anger though. It's like how I hated rich kids growing up because some of them were mean to poor kids.  Or how I hate cops because I've seen them haul off good people into cages. I am hurt, and I want to sooth my vulnerability with hate. When I say stuff like, ""Cops are bastards,"" I'm not in denial that I'm expressing anger and hatred. I am NOT being misunderstood. I am making **dehumanizing generalizations** about a large group of people, and people will condemn me for thar behavior deservingly.

Although perhaps I'm tone policing. If someone is right, it's ad hom to say, ""u mad, bro?"""
2774,Doctor_Red_Pill,I think mgtow1 is fine. It’s a good place to vent. Although I would change the name to “Post-roasties” because it’s obvious the people there are still holding on to some baggage from bad relationships.
2775,lonewolfhistory,I think TFM kinda expresses it best. MGTOW is a path or cycle that begins in unadulterated hate and rage. I think many in mgtow1 are just in that part of the cycle. I just wish there was a sub for every state of the path
2776,inconspeakuous,"Everyone's just a sex addict anymore, goes for both men and women. Very hard to find a good relationship with the opposite sex, friend or girlfriend.

2778,inconspeakuous,"I try over and over and somehow I keep breaking. what pissed me off most was that I messaged a girl on Tinder and she really led me on, all the way up until I jerked off to one of her pics (I was 30 days clean on nofap). Turns out she's just a camgirl trying to get a new customer.

I felt so empty.

No more girls until I straighten out my own life."
2779,inconspeakuous,"Women get away with all of that because of the halo effect that they hide behind. It's really not 100% their fault if you ask me. It's men's faults for being sex addicts and letting women step all over them. If their man denies them anything, they threaten him with sexual rejection.

I think I read somewhere that 75% of women turn down 90% of men just so they can try to get the 'perfect' man, which is 10% of men. I forget the numbers, but they're ballpark.

Tinder is a perfect example of that. I read on a social experiment that average-looking women get more likes and matches than above-average looking men. I tried it myself and put a stock photo of a decent looking girl on a fake account (just one pic, no bio and no other info) and got over 100 likes in a day then deleted it. I believe I'm a good looking guy (not a 9 or 10/10 by any means) and I have racked up about 30 likes in a month.

And then it's even more heartbreaking when I'm around girls who are always talking about how there are no good men around anymore. It really hurts, and it makes me question myself. I wish I could tell them that, but it would just make me look worse.


And that's what brought me here. I'm not ashamed to say that I'm tired of hurt feelings. I'm just going to go my own way until I figure my life out, and maybe even cross paths with someone who isn't perfect, but at least respects my values (doesn't have to agree) and treats me like a human being.

/r/mgtow is a subreddit, not a person.  It doesn't learn anything.

Its individual contributors do.  They get past their rage, and then generally move on.  They might still participate on the sub, but with less of the rage-memes and so on.

However, every day thousands of new men are born into the world, and trained to be bluepilled.  Eventually many will become redpilled and will enter the rage phase.  Then they join /r/mgtow and many other subs.

There will always be more new MGTOW than experienced ones, because MGTOW is a growing group.  

You might feel like you're speaking into the void when you try to help them, but you're not.  You actually are helping people.  It is just that the people you help are quickly replaced by 100 others who still need your help.  You'll never be done if your goal is to redpill the world.  

Just be at peace with it.  Accept that there will always be a ton of new MGTOW who are raging.  Help those you're willing to help.  Realize you can't help them all, but most will eventually figure it out.

And of course people will judge MGTOW by the vocal ragers.  Who cares..."

Calling women on their shit = / = women hating .

Usually what happens with pictures like this is you end up with low-effort comments, and a bunch of ""hur-dur wahmens"" comments start popping up which makes more work for the mod team. 

Pictures like this would be better off being posted on mgtow1, which does allow for more of the meaning and images.

Always be making improvements and progression in all aspects of life - personal, professional, physical, mental, emotional and never forget financial. If you have goals set in these areas and are continually striving, you won't have much time to think about anything else but will be achieving new levels of success regularly.

I wasted at least a decade bouncing around addictions, and have finally settled on [beekeeping](/r/beekeepers) and reading. I never had any problems being a simple chump (i.e. dating), but have spent a lot of time, recently, working on just myself. I fuck up all the time with most of those past addictive personality traits — but have been clean from prescription speeds for over eleven years, now. It feels good to think about that!

We're all still young enough (in spite of being fifteen years older than OP) to make important changes. Even minor setbacks (here and there, if uncontrollable <-- work on that) can help re-determine the determined seeker.

I spent a good part of January on ""a bender"" (i.e. not taking my own advice), and would recommend that you focus on good things and filling your time outside of typical addictions (admitting that beekeeping is going to get quite out of hand, this year... just like anything that stimulates the amygdala and other pleasure centers)."

2836,LesterBurnham97,"Okay this might be a bit longer.

At first there will be of course no damage at all directly from this i can agree on that. But do you want to read genuine stories or just fiction? I prefer genuine stuff. The reason why somebody might come here to write crap is to gain karma to sideway the mod bot. Look at the amount of upvotes this has. So after that person has made enough karma his posts and comments will not be monitored automatically and this person is able to post hateful crap what might get the reddit mods on plan sooner or later and the same can happen here as to the original sub. 

So something you said has got me confused. That is that being distrusting is a blue pill problem. Being blue pilled is believing in marriage, true love in the romantic way and in women being the angel like beings that is sold to society everyday and everywhere. When there is a problem it is too much trust as a blue pilled person just puts his trust into this belief. 

Also as you got red pilled didn't you accept the mesage that in this day and age the law and society gave so much power to women that this power can easily be abused and ruin your whole life. So taking the red pill inhabits an amount of distrust itself. 

Another thing i want to say. I noticed a behaviour in more and more mgtow guys as if mgtow is kind of religious enlightenment. In your post it is the phrase about coming from a place of truth. This sounds like religion and not anymore like facts based idea for a lifestyle. Be aware i do not want to offend you because from my pov you can believe in whatever you want but mgtow never had the goal to be a movement or kind of a religious substitute for traditional believes. It is based on a skeptical, realistic, logical view on society, ltr and marriage.

To sum it all up. I am a natural born skeptic and directly noticed some obvious flaws in this story and wanted to get all guys here aware of those flaws. Because just believing in anything someone posts and cheering the op for any crap that fits the banner of mgtow turns this sub into a circle jerking echo chamber.

So i ask you to let this points i made sink into your head to digest them and get where i am coming from. 

Have a good one"

2838,Sid_Insidious,"Paragraph 1: I never thought about that, but I wouldn't put it past some anti-MGTOW fruitcake. Generally though, left-wing ideologues are the laziest people you'll ever meet. They make a lot of noise, but aside from pointing a finger and screeching some leftist accusation (raaaaaaape!) they're pretty much useless.

Paragraph 2: Blue Pill people lie to themselves on a continual and ongoing basis - they have to. You can't have that much cognitive dissonance and lack of self-reflection without some serious lies. ""If I try real hard, I won't get divorced like those other guys."" ""She doesn't like me for what I provide to her, she likes me for WHO I AM.""  ""Guys who get divorced were just a-holes or bad neglectful husbands. Divorce doesn't usually happen to guys like me.""  ""Hypergamy, AF/BB, Briffault's law... that's just stuff bitter ugly losers say. Females are just delicate nurturing creatures."" ""I can make her happy so I am not worried. You can't make a woman happy - you're a loser, who can't get laid.""  Right.

Paragraph 3: Red Pill is truth to me. I refer to it as ""Red Pill Truth"". It's the truth that smashes a culture and a lifetime full of bullshit lies. MGTOW is truth - MGTOW is a way to be true to one's self, and explore what one's true values are. Truth doesn't have to be religious. Truth is just something some of us seek in life. Others avoid the truth like the plague. 

Paragraph 4. I didn't mean to crap on your skepticism. I'm very skeptical too, by nature. I was just offering a positive spin on it. Aka, even though it's annoying or even offensive, what can they really do? If they're outed as a sock puppet or troll, they get das ban hamma, ya?

2904,if-kennedy,Got banned for saying I’m a woman
2905,everythingisahoax,"I just got banned from that sub. Awaiting response from mods as to the reason why. Upon seeing comments in this megathread, I doubt one of their fragile mods ever will. The irony is that the sub is modded by insecure males who have lowered and deluded themselves into the same rhetorics and tactics of feminist sub mods (silencing and ad hominems). There's no rationality or discussions there; just memes, hate mongering and an underlying tone of white supremacy. Unsubbed. Good riddance."

MGTOW has unfortunately always been seemingly dominated by boneheaded right wing Americans with little political education beyond a single fetid corporate news source. They're all for displaying their superior alpha masculinity for having 'moved off the plantation"" but point out out that right wing politics is nothing more than obedience to authoritarian institutions, debt servitude and flag waving group think etc and the hive pile on. They can't handle it.

And now out-and-out fascist sympathizers are welcomed to the fold. I guess that's no surprise given the amount of 'white genocide' retards that lurk there.

Looking at the rules for this sub and noticing one of them explicitly states ""no racist/nazi shit"" suggests it's quite a problem in certain MGTOW circles."
2912,Sideofcaution,"I was banned due to me stating that even though I am gay the problems of modern women is equally reverberating within the morally contradicting cage of modern gay communities (tribalism, ego boosting, hypergamy, increase in stds, etc) but because I am gay my opinion doesn’t matter in MGTOW."
2913,MetaCognitio,"Not quite r/mgtow but got banned from /r/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen for responding to this post:

> Is having daughters the ultimate cuckoldry?

> I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.

> Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.

> As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically


That post is freaking weird and creepy. My response:


> This is some weird creepy pedo shit. What are you going to do? Have sex with her yourself. As long as she makes you proud and does great in life, who really cares? Yeah she is gonna have sex, as long as she respects herself, who cares? Would it bother you if she waited till marriage too? Or is the thought of your daughter ever having a boyfriend/husband to difficult for you.

> For me, as long as she does not turn out to be a loser, being passed around by a bunch of losers, marries a great guy and does well in life, it is not too much of my business.

> This obsessing over your child's vagina is weird and creepy.

Sounds like the dude wants to ravage his daughter or is bothered about her ever having sex, even if it is her husband. Anyone that talks about his daughter's 'tight pussy' has some serious issues. That post is weird beyond belief."
2914,,"not banned but I realized how toxic and hateful a lot of the dudes there are, people suck, sadly sometimes people you date or marry are shit, and if you decide to focus on yourself I'm all for that

the difference being actually 'going your own way', not posting about how trash women were to you every day and living in an echo chamber

But the last conversation some seem quite upset, because I kind of took more of a middle ground position vs to an extreme side that is common in that sub."
2919,Adernain,"Is there a sub we can post about the original MGTOW and how sexist, hateful and misogynistic it is? 

I got banned for making a comment and agreeing with someone about how the sub changed, became full of conservatives who hate women and are sexist. They generalise every woman, behaving like you cant find love with a woman and have a nice life. Like so many men did on this earth."

Permabanned. no explanation."
2941,NoPidgeonChess,I got banned for saying that there’s a vocal minority of men bashing women and that’s why MGTOW gets a bad rep. No response either to my message.

2947,keropokemans,"Someone posted a really hateful comment about an actress and I got banned for saying ""WTF man""

Really the post I was commenting of was a bit surrealist claiming that for this actress to be recognized she should be walking with no skirt and cum dripping from his pants

2948,simplisticallysimple,"I got banned for ""concern trolling."" Sigh. What an abomination that sub is. The community is such a shame and unrepresentative of the ideology itself since MGTOW is actually one of the sanest philosophies in today's world."

2950,RaskolniFao,"banned for saying a joke.. concern trolling btw

there is not freedom of expression with those cuck mods

never again"
2951,MuleFool42,"I just got banned. I'm actually not sure why. I did comment on a post that harboring hate is not healthy. That hating shows that you care, that hating gives power to the other person to use against you. Then I got banned. At least, that's what I think it was for. I am waiting for them to tell me what I did wrong.

[Edit] I actually told them that I didn't care why I was banned. Then I un-joined. They don't seem to be able to tolerate different points of view. I guess they're just like woke SJWs that get triggered easily."
2952,stormspireit,I got banned for saying a man is obliged to provide for his wife. Lol don't like to provide? then don't marry. Got banned by saying the truth. Mods there are the equivalent of feminazis.  Just as bad as feminists.

2954,gielrebel,HAHAHAHA got banned for saying not marrying is an unhealthy mindset which is running away from the problem than taking a challenge to work with it. Well If you need to ban everyone showing a different perspective certainly your beliefs are weak !
2955,veronikuh,"I just got banned for saying that I was a woman feminist and support MGTOW. 🤷🏻‍♀️ They also deleted all the positive comments people posted in response. I guess if you’re a feminist and say something kind to them, you’re ruining the illusion that we are the enemy and deserve to be banned."
2956,wsmith79,I got banned for speaking out against the political memes that are being posted there.  The right wing is attempting to infiltrate mgtow and fill it with nothing but political rhetoric
2957,Ferg_NZ,"I got banned for ""concern trolling"" whatever the fuck that means.  I pointed out it was possible to be MGTOW without looking and acting like a woman hating incel and if the sub wanted to improve their image, they needed to tone down the gratuitous anti-woman posts."
2958,Factor13th,"I am about to just leave mgtow1because guys there act like they cuckedtow. They believe you an mra because you simply make the piint that a lazy mgtow that just watches the world burn.. Is just as bad as a femnist.

For a group about men they sure do act beta."
2959,thoughtOG83,"What I do not understand is why so many MGTOW's mock women for having cats, when so many MGTOW's post pictures of themselves with dogs.

And hating women is just nonsensical.

One can be wary of them, yes.

But to hate women is to hate life, especially if ostensibly you're a heterosexual.

I wasn't banned, but I could tell that it was very echo chamber- esque.

MGTOW was originally about protecting oneself during a divorce.

They have posts with FGTOW's (fakes going their own way) decrying their own sisters, like they are going to be accused of incest or something.

That shit be weird."

2968,rhamnouse,"RANT begins..
I have been permanently banned from r/MGTOW for no reason and without any explanation. The one place where you could talk like a free man and add value without the fear of someone shutting you down. Or so I thought. The mods have chosen to hide behind their screens and not respond after repeated requests to give a reason. I went back and saw my activity to see what might've triggered the ban although I've not violated a single rule. I might've answered questions meant for ladies in some other subs and interacted with different kinds of people, none of which is a reason to ban. Why I'm so disappointed with this particular ban is that MGTOW is a good forum for men to develop self-respect and develop their personalities independent of their SMV, to rid themselves of societal baggage. This ban has thrown all that to the dogs and made me question if a good part of its members are really cucks who just want to have the feminazi experience because they are deprived of it elsewhere...

I was extremely respectful and was upfront about being a woman so they wouldn’t feel lied too. A few people were nice and gave me honest and respectful explanations but the majority was just hateful insults. I got banned for “spamming” and spreading “feminism” 

I thought it was ironic that i gave them the opportunity to clear the air and make themselves seem like a legitimate sub and they chose to hate me for it. I don’t care what other men do, power to y’all for focusing on yourselves and even more power to you for not having to be hateful in order to do it"

I can post any of the links from my comment here if anyone wants.

I PMed them to ask why they had banned me, but I didn't get a response. My personal theory is that whilst the /r/MGTOW mods are likely not particularly homophobic themselves, perhaps they are being 'sponsored' in some way by far-right elements who very much are."

Oh, and I called them neckbeards. Just felt like sharing this somewhere and it seemed related. Because the guy with ""mgtow"" flair really gave off extremely strong /r/mgtow vibes and he made ""meme"" remarks entirely unrelated to the topic at hand. Such as hating on ""soyboys"" or using other political ""meme"" insults which would make him seem cool amongst his friends. And it being just a matter of time until I will get banned in the first mgtow sub. Granted how I'm generally not sure whether I really belong into mgtow subs, but I find it interesting regardless.

3026,jporter910101017383,"I got banned for saying someone’s an incel because all his posts weren’t actually about mgtow but hating women, I called him out on It and said people like him give us a bad name then got banned"

3028,CameronSins,"Ive been in MGTOW since the day we were 9000 subs 
I posted some opinion about Trump (denying of climate change) and I think that was what got me the axe

I still visit the place , and I hope maybe someday the mods will let me back in"

3034,Karmacowmelon,Banned from MGTOW. Look at my post history for why.
3035,Loban8990,"I got banned randomly yesterday. Messaged the mods twice, and still no answer."
3036,Justlivinhere,I just got banned for making a post on why woman cant support mgtow. Im fairly new to reddit so the terms incel and mgtow are new to me and i was guinenly curious why they wont allow woman. I thought it was a great idea as i wanted to introduce a kid of friends of mine to that sub because he really dont have much hobbys and i hoped that sub could support him in finding his own way. But damn those man are full of hate and full of themselves and not about going their own way.
3037,TigPlaze,I may be banned at mgtow 1.  I make posts there and they never show up.  WTF?  They're totally on topic posts without any flaming of anyone.
3038,,[removed]
3039,dolcesaur,Why did they ban me? All I did was make a simple comment
3040,,[removed]
3041,5fingerdiscounts,Why mgtow banning people?
3042,debanked,"Yes banned. No idea why, whatever

I had got out most of my redpill rage, so I guess they sent me on my way"
3043,,"So wow, I can't believe I just got banned from r/MGTOW. I thought I was one of their brothers. I loved the content that was posted. I didn't see it as hateful at all. I saw it as frustrated and hurt red pilled men who needed to vent. All was well until I notice some of my comments were getting no activity, so I made this post.

>I have been suspicious of any posts or comments I make that have no activity, so I asked one of the members to try to look at any of my posts or comments that stay at 1 karma. More and more recently, my comments are missing and my posts are removed without explanation. When I attempt to contact mods, I get ignored. Mods, if you have a problem with me, talk to me. Don't ignore me. If you are overwhelmed with mod stuff, get more mods to help. It's really irritating to try to participate in a sub when my stuff gets randomly removed for no reason.

When that post was deleted, I pressed the mods for an explanation and I got banned. If they really don't want to deal with people or the stress of moderating a sub, they should step down as mods. Just removing submissions and comments without explanation is an unacceptable way to run a forum regardless of the subject of the forum."
3044,Sepinde,"Got banned for advocating letting men go their own way, even if that way isn't away from women"

It just got me by surprise."
3047,Anthony_Fellowlin,Got banned for questioning an incel
3048,Buckeye44302,Not sure why I got banned.  It was a thread where guys were being keyboard warriors and really ripping on women.  Didn't defend the women so much as tried to get them to see a bit of perspective.  Always thought going your own way meant not caring what women said or did and you just focus on doing things you want to do.
3049,RT-AC66U,Yep
3050,Matiyah,"I just got banned five minutes ago for making a dark joke about a certain female who posted some crap which was posted on the sub.  Apparently, that's considered threatening.  Even though said rule isnt listed on the community page at all but can be found if you attempt to message the mods.  I think they do that for plausible deniability.

While reading their rules the hypocrisy is kind of stunning.  The whole philosophy is about freedom yet enforcing those rules means that people with a different opinion on social issues wont be able to post there.  \*Confused Jackie Chan\*"
3051,Natty-Not-Guilty,got banned for saying getting the snip is beta
3052,themightyJG,i was banned for no apparent reason.
3053,OverlordWhiteWolf,Banned for...something. I honestly don’t know. I wasn’t given a reason. Replied to the ban message twice and messaged one of the mods. No reply.
3054,TheDemonWhoComes,wasnt banned but what's wrong with the original mgtow?
3055,lost-icon,I got banned from the 'witchcraft women against patriarchy' sub. Must've touched a nerve.
3056,Sandman10372,"I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure this comment got me banned by whatever tradcon misogynist pussy is running the show over there now.

""These comments prove that a bunch of you guys have a stick up your ass and are opposed to people having fun. If you guys approach women with 1/10th the vitriol you display in the comments, you're never going to get laid, much less by multiple women at one time...poor bastards."""

when you allow women to run rampant with no supervision and no social or legal consequences for degenerate behavior feminism, promiscuity and other forms of degeneracy are the result. Thats all i said and i got banned. I would think thats common sense but i guess not."
3059,nla6219,This MGTOW sub is far better so far. Refreshing to find a place where my speech wont be censored

3067,Ferg_NZ,"I was exactly the same.   They called it ""concern trolling"" when I said they could do better than hating on women with gratuitous posts."
3068,E_T_0629,"Yeah. Because they think that the only way for a man to go on his fucking way is to sit around and post threads on a forum about how you hate women, instead of just visiting cool places, and befriending people regardless of their gender."
3069,Toshiba1point0,omg...sorry thats ridiculous

MGTOW and bi as well. Understandably men are far less judgemental and psychotic and make great partners, so I totally feel you."
3081,MuleFool42,"It's a terrible sub. I was there because I believe that MGTOW is important for all men, especially young men just starting out. But they require racism, sexism, and overall bigotry. No thanks. This is a much better sub and I hope that the majority of MGTOW migrate to this sub."
3082,monk2019,">Agree, mgtow should not be political or strive to be it, it should be a platform to provide information to those who seek it. Not one to advocate for trump/hillary/whatever politician or similar stuff."
3083,pedanticpterodactyl,Nobody is more obsessed with Chad than incels!

3091,Azuzu88,"Yeah, I just got banned for calling out a holocaust denier. I had also noticed a real slide down in to women-hating posts and very little about actually going your own way. Seems it is very much the new r/incels."
3092,MuleFool42,"I agree because I thought that's where the most like minded people were for me, but they are actually just a hate group. I think MGTOW is important for men, all men, and that ultimately it has to do with investing one one's self. It's not about hate. 

They will never get out of their own prison. Thank goodness for this sub instead."
3093,MuleFool42,Nobody will reply. The mods are just as spineless as the members of that sub.
3094,,I’ve just been banned for making this exact comparison; between feminists and MGTOW.
3095,AlanTheGr8,"Yesh they has landed. The pro hillary wants to be homosexual but still cant get inshills haz landed.

Your daughter wants to slut it up and catch a beta on the downward slide.   


Respecto-boy will NEVER get 'her best', emotion/love/lust/pussy/asshole/tits-wise, but McThuggins is gonna blast his gangsta seed up in her cunt raw and call her a slut while he slaps her. Respecto-boy will 'luck out' later when he signs on to her shitshow for a chance at some boring, condom'ed, purely missionary-style bi-monthly access to her haggered out hairy Arby's roast beef bun, overproofed pizza dough ass, and sagging 'tiger striped' dangle-melons...   


You should have taken the lead a LONG, long time ago instead of letting wifey turn your daughters into young cum-guzzling fucktoy mercenaries that bring ruin to our society. She's a fucktoy now, you can't remove the many, many gangsta-ass dicks she's ridden from her soul, and she's eternally pairbound to some random piece of shit thug life asshole. Mocha Latte Bebbies will be coming soon, and Grampa gonna have to pony up 'cause McThuggins ain't payin' shit bitch."

3109,PhoenixRising-MGTOW,Definitely. I haven’t been banned but I clearly see the same thing you do. Loads of female trolls on MGTOW posting Incel type BS to try to discredit the movement.

3116,DevilSweets,"Of course not.


There are always two sides of every coin:


One side is the MGTOW sub reddit that have been infested with cuck mods who will ban you for anything that's not against the rules cuz of feefees.


And the other side is this sub that want to ignore female nature and hypergamy by overloading the sub with other subjects....as if they you to forget the main catalyst for why men went MGTOW in the first place.



The only ""safe place"" that you can't get banned from is YouTube. Peace brother."
3117,Mercyz89,Just got banned as well for no reason lol. They got feminist mods over there?

3133,The-Deviant-One,"There is a good reason for some of us who were posting photography. I can't speak for the guys who were just googling nice shots and posting them, dunno WTF that's about. But there's so much negativity over there. Sulking and stories of guys getting hammered on by life and society. I'm actually doing really well which is why I started posting my personal photography there. Along with snippets of little successes I'm having in my life. Life is hard, MTGOW can seem daunting to new comers and guys down on their luck. I wanted to show that you can straighten your shit up and have a good time and thing's end up positively for MGTOW guys."

3136,xxMeccxx,Same lol I made sarcastic posts but they didn't like it at all
3137,,I do need someone like that!!
3138,MuleFool42,Totally agree. They get triggered easily.
3139,MuleFool42,"Which is fine with me. r/MGTOW is a place for children who are in a suspended stage of development. Screw that. 

MGTOW is so much more. The rejection of hate should be part of it, as well as the intense focus on self around personal, professional, physical, financial, mental, emotional, and spiritual goals. 

It really should not be a hate group, which is what r/MGTOW is intent on being. 

What a bunch of fucking losers."

3141,justAcuriousDalek,Funny. Cos I think we have the same goal. Autonomy
3142,,I got banned for “concern trolling” as well. Apparently that means that you are pretending to be on the side of MGTOW when you really aren’t. How they determine that someone is a concern troll is beyond me
3143,itriedbut,Merely getting a reason for why you were banned Is actually amazing. I got nothing.
3144,screamifyouredriving,It's been taken over by incels.

3147,thoughtOG83,"How was this downvoted?  


Even once?"
3148,donkeynique,"And then to come in here and see people saying the problem with the sub is clearly feminist infiltration or that the mods are cucks... Nah man. If that is a MGTOW's best guess on why the sub is toxic, the sub is just toxic MGTOW. No infiltration needed."
3149,n00bRECON_BR,"I can agree with that there are many FGTOW, but the mocking over woman with cats is just a stereotype kind of joke (i guess), it means that woman with cats are so desesperated for atention cuz they cant get laid (or something like that) so they use that stereotype to use as an argument. MGTOW posts pictures of them with dogs cuz it is popular belif that dogs are the most loyal living creature to a man. Than they also use that as an argument to prove that dogs are more loyal than the average modern woman. I hope I helped you."
3150,GazingIntotheAbyss1,"I think there is a law of the universe that every group eventually descends into a collective circle jerk. The mark of wisdom is to know when to move on, and to not be to attached so one is able to move on when that time arrives"

3164,wsmith79,Yep.  It’s been highjacked by political agents and apparently they have mod support

It’s one of a very few places that men can be open, and receive feedback from other men, who’ve probably had similar experiences. We don’t all agree with each, but we get it. Some men have been through more than words could ever express in this thread. I’ve personally visited one of the women’s thread here, very clear about men not posting there. I get it. I believe you meant no harm, but deciding to remove a hornets nest in your porch is synonymous with attempting to reason with some of us. We need a place of our own to bitch and moan amongst our own.

I had created a few accounts down the road to keep my daily red pills since I don't use Reddit for much else.

However, this time around I am pretty sure being in a mgtow sub where you feel like walking on eggshells like a relationship with a woman is last thing I want.

Fuck them."
3185,FlintAustin,"Yup you are not alone man. As you clearly see here lol.

There has been something fishy since last year. I was shadow banned for about 2 weeks. Then I was banned for 'low effort' post and unbanned once I wrote them about 5-6 times.

Again banned again lol.

I think they are too concerned about not being perceived a certain way.

Basically bashing females is encouraged and seems to be a hard lean on male-victim narrative. More like a systematic way to impress young minds but censor experienced men who see the grey than just black and white."

3189,Solid_Gold_Turd,Unbanned? Does such a thing even happen over there?
3190,Impossible-asset,"Correct, because people havent stopped being banned from there without any reason. And they still post here in the main forum, which then gets clogged with posts on the subject. So that's why there is another thread."

3202,PoseidonLordoftheSea,"Same here, man. I didn’t realize how toxic it was until it tried to drag me even deeper. I’m glad I’m thinking much healthier thoughts these days. It’s hard to feel happy when you’re carrying around hatred for an entire gender"

3207,JihadNinjaCowboy,That's pretty meta.
3208,ausgamer529,I made a post and was banned a half our later. Asked why and they said gay men aren't real men
3209,fromo_latte,Or if it’s a biological man identifying as a woman... that’s fair game.
3210,Toshiba1point0,I would but its been way too long.
3211,Azuzu88,"Yeah, a lot of incels and woman-haters seemed to have joined the group. I miss the days when it was guys bonding through shared stories of why the went MGTOW and what they're up to."
3212,MarcusAurileus70,Yep banned for calling out hatred. That sub is dead.
3213,transcis,Boob-shaped mountain?
3214,GTOH4U,Have you ever researched the 6 million jews died though? The jews were making the exact same claim of 6 million dying in the Russian pogroms a decade earlier. It's in their talmud the 6 million figure.
3215,everythingisahoax,Yup.. and still no response. Maybe mommy took the wifi away again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3216,ThatPercussionGuy,It's literally just pinkpillfeminism except with guys

30 upvotes. I got 4 downvotes. 

Dude talking about his daughter's 'tight pussy' or her getting 'fucked in every hole' 🤮

When I told the mod he should be ashamed of having that post on the sub, they were actually ashamed of my 'virtue signalling' response."

3221,MetaCognitio,I was the one that got banned for calling him out!
3222,MelodicBrush,"That's my point. Exactly the same happened to me. I only said that my gf seems to be an exception. Boom ban. They want to make the sub into a hate sub an nothing else, so that they can discredit MGTOW as just being men that want all women dead or something."
3223,GoatKnows,"Well I will say this when there is over a 90% chance you will interact with a womanbin some form and you demand that there is 100% no reason to talk about it as though it doesn't exist you are setting men up to fail. Because your mail, your Uber driver, your public transportation ride, & much more will include women. And all it takes is one slip up to arm her with the key to destroying you"
3224,the_milk_is_back,"I get that. But to be MGTOW is to acknowledge certain things regarding society and women. But to dwell on it is simply NOT going one's own way. And to be so rigid in judging people is just a miserable way to live life.

In my experience the padawans like posts such as ""look at this post-wall thot looking for a simp orbiter beta provider"".

The masters like ""I'm learning to truly enjoy life being single and here's this car I'm restoring"" or ""me and my friend on the lake at sunrise going fishing""

The rage stage is real, but life is so much better when you leave it behind."
3225,haagendaas,Yeah one of those guys called me a “fake MGTOW” all because I “only” refused to do hookups and came into relationships cautiously because I knew the dangers
3226,GoatKnows,"My brother to me I understand if it's hate speach their will be threats of violence but the truth is MGTOW & GYOW is about avoiding women & staying in your goal. And to avoid reminding men about a danger that is in their instinct to come help that's only a trap. For example a woman & her kids are stuck on the road, & a man helps without knowing that he set himself up for the woman to lie that he tried to rape her in front of her kids, just so she can get attention. MGTOW needs to keep that fear of contact with the modern American women who for attention will not only weaponize herself but her bastard children. We men already know how to deal with one another it's that danger of wanting to be honorable & helpful that women prey on & it's something we have to fight against every moment. Oh a women can't lift her package tried to help accused of stealing, oh a woman bumped into a you she fell you tried to help claims you touched her inappropriately. 

Yes by being MGTOW & GYOW we declared victory & freedom, but our guard must stay up as all times not against women but our own nature that will lead us to helping them."
3227,passsingstrange,They are angreerrry
3228,kayfab,"Yeah this is kind of weird, this is why i never follow religion nor politics."
3229,AlanTheGr8,People should be free to pro anti trump everywhere and not banbed for it unless its trolling etc. Free speach isbunkown to most of reddit and trp is quarantined but incest and dogsex subs r not..insanity
3230,kayfab,completely stupid ban and unbanned what ever happen to freedom of speech now there are a zillion rules to follow or you get banned before posting.....
3231,kayfab,Sorry to offend you fatty
3232,Svartanatten,It's all socialism?
3233,AlanTheGr8,"I swear that MensRights and MGTOW are stealth channels that is  are psyops. There are lots of silly mods there,  that may or not be women, and the goal may be to give the appearance of free speach while shadow banning all posts that hit close to home or are too dangerous and truthful.

&#x200B;

It would be too obvious to outright ban ALL male speach so it gives them plausable deniablility and cover.

&#x200B;

Also many of the mods may be easily triggered, have a bad life, general mean trolls, etc.

&#x200B;

I think a lot of reddit, like IRC, and early internet, people camped out or bought names of channels/domains so that they could control them.

&#x200B;

For instance it wouldn't surprise me at all if a Woman  were to start a channel called MGTOW to monitor and control all thought that goes through there.

&#x200B;

Heck, men could run some feminist channels. Wouldn't that be funny. Laff"
3234,Yonisensei18,"Damn, same exact time happened to me"
3235,Yonisensei18,"At this point, I have already stopped trying"
3236,tegs98,Yeah
3237,DiccDucc,"Right. I commented on a post in where a couple were both acting like children, and was neither on the man's side, or the woman's side. I wrote about how both of them were immature, and how neither should be in a relationship before they mature a little bit more.   


Then I got called an anti-male cuck (for calling both people in the couple assholes) and banned. 

&#x200B;

Yikes."
3238,gielrebel,didn't catch your drift here mate.
3239,veronikuh,That’s exactly what I said! It is the same goal! Feminism allowed me to define myself apart from my relationship to men. And MGTOW allows men to define themselves apart from their relationship to women. I think it’s awesome for everyone to do that. And I’m glad this group aims to do that without conflating it with viewing women as the enemy. Cheers. Solidarity brothers.
3240,Ferg_NZ,">How they determine that someone is a concern troll is beyond me

I agree.  I think ""concern trolling"" is a bullshit way of deflecting from an issue.  Concern trolling doesn't exist outside of reddit."
3241,Factor13th,Seems like they most have lol Mgtow doesnt need a leader they all gotta learn to stand on their own two feet and learn to fight.. No point in bitching if they wont do anything about it.
3242,Factor13th,"To be honest I wouldnt give a shit. I am always honest and wont be shut up whether people, ban, kick, beat me up, or kill me. No point in complaining and not doing anything.

While feminist and betas kep destroying our lives in society."
3243,Factor13th,I got banned for making points on why it's a movement and for disrespecting someone who was acting stupid with me lol
3244,AlanTheGr8,Not all
3245,pwandapop,How? They banned me for saying something they didn’t like and I think that’s toxic and shouldn’t be encouraged.
3246,pwandapop,I got banned for saying you shouldn’t say all women are sick fucks
3247,krugerand9,i suspect a feminist has covertly broken into the mods club over there.
3248,IntellegoTheTrue1,He must be the same incel he swore to kick off r/MGTOW. Ugh
3249,The-Deviant-One,"Same. Been active and in good standing for a very long time. Banned, no warning, no response."
3250,T0000009,"That's my guess.

A Commie fag or feminist cunt infiltrator is doing it."
3251,ZombiNawhal,"Bingo! Part of me wonders if they have a secret idealog Moderator that they don't know about? How could they be so wilfully closed minded?

It boggles the mind."
3252,Untowardopinions,Jfc the persecution complex.  Literally ALL OF REDDIT is men talking to men about their hobbies.  You just also want to drop in “and women fucking suck” somewhere you won’t get called an incel for it.
3253,cmdralpha,That exactly what happened to me just unsubscribe cause there is no point anymore
3254,double-happiness,"Well, what's your explanation then? Why are they being so censorious when that's so much against MGTOW philosophy?"
3255,AlanTheGr8,"Why? What is the preffered word for homosexual these days? Ppl get so butthurt and keep changing the preferred words... Unless the intent is bad the word isnt bad. Black, colored, gay, whatever.

They hate themselves so they ban u. Same with that story of woman who bans if u say female.

Its a crazy world of everyonevis king of their microbubble. Oh king! Ban! Im a queen! Ban! Dont assume my gender! They are just looking to make others miserable.

And it spills into the real world... It was busy at the gas station pumps and i waited and i finally started pulling into one and someone else who had just got their literally went ape shit and cursing me late 40s asshat acting like 5yr old.

So Im like u want 2 fight bro? And hea like yeah get out of ur car! So I start 2 video him and he fled... What a mighty wuss crybaby. 

The mods are like him x10 -20, years"
3256,BeckyLynchIsBetter,"I think it's stupid, but okay. Thanks for letting me know, btw."
3257,,you're joking. will you seriously get banned for that here?
3258,GSV-ZeroGravitas,"Well balanced and sensible? I've been called some atrocious things in my time, but never that!!🤣"
3259,,"tbf MGTOW isn't a movement, they don't want to fix anything."
3260,krugerand9,"we don't move forward.

 Isnt that obvious to you? 

Guess not because you have a woman's brain."
3261,,"Seriously, it's almost like they are trying to give the movement a bad name and get it banned from Reddit. I can't say I blame the rest of the world for assuming we're just a bunch of bitter incels when the men who are supposedly ""going their own way"" literally just obsessively talk about women and nothing else."
3262,IntellegoTheTrue1,"Learning how to deal with people the best way possible is not niceism or blue pilled attitude, it's just a tool to save yourself from mental stress and useless conflict. Lately I learned the value of it, I think it should be a staple of MGTOW to learn how to deal with people. Monk mode is just toxic and bad for self improvement, even if you have s job that doesn't require interaction much"
3263,DangZagnut,"I can't, /u/Impossible-asset banned me.  You don't see me posting do you?

It still doesn't answer the question why there isn't a ""banned from MGTOW2 mega thread""."
3264,theanchorman05,Don't talk logic with him. Just say something horrible about women and he'll go away.
3265,DespawnMe,Lol okie dokie
3266,Drayelya,"That is not the point of the ideology of MGTOW. MGTOW advocates for men deciding what way they want to go, even if that way isn’t in line with how other MGTOW think. The point is to offer/receive advice but, not to force your own personal idea of what MGTOW is down another man’s throat. This is why a lot of the monks have left the main MGTOW sub or even got banned for ridiculing how it’s members act."
3267,wathon2,"this.   Freedom of speech for me but not for thee. 

Sounds familiar,  sounds like feminism.   No wonder people equate MGTOW to feminism.  

The MODS over at MGTOW (if they are reading this comment) need to get their heads out of their asses and take a long look in the mirror."
3268,nla6219,"Im far from liberal, i oppose almost everything modern day liberals/leftists stand for. That being said and even being a Theocratic Distributist personally I believe in free speech for all whether i agree with you or not. The only laws that are legit are the original amendments in the U.S. constitution. Everything else has no validity. Any laws or policies that say you have no right to speech, privacy or armaments are unconstitutional, invalid and must be fought against. The internet is the new public sphere and free speech for all must be preserved and defended. (Including liberals Lol)"

3272,Fylix_Aerou,"Dude, *WHAT*? I've seen the topic touched on in comments with respect, but to see that from the main MGTOW sub boggles me. What an asshat.

I'm not sure if you watch TFM by chance, but he's addressed the topic before. Going your way isn't just about relationships, but a path to self actualization without the need for external validation. Gay men and bi men absolutely can be MGTOW."
3273,Fylix_Aerou,"Sorry for the second post, but I did want to show an example of something good I found from the subreddit.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/744lyd/gay_and_mgtow/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I'm so sorry that mod was a flaming shitbag. Keep going your own way, dude."
3274,poopiedoodie710,Closest I’ve found to any sort of positive space for men has been r/menslib. Admittedly I’m kinda leery about this sub but I’ll give it a chance; r/MGTOW has some warped individuals on there lol
3275,MuleFool42,"Exactly. Men need to share stories, collaborate, and support each other. That's what it should be, instead it's a cesspool over there. This is a much better sub."
3276,GTOH4U,"Yep, that's where it's going. Just an incel woman hating jerk circle rather that a positive group where people discussed what path they were taking and how to do it etc."
3277,,"this exactly. 

Westerners have been so brainwashed by the 6 million lie it is utterly ridiculous to have an educated discussion about this.

I have seen the information you are talking about and the 6 million figure was lauded by jewish press going back into the 1800s for a number of events."
3278,DyingSociety,I like to think that most individuals are sane in mgtow but this screams mental health issues. Maybe I shouldn't associate myself with these people considering what the mod did...
3279,weasted_,Mb rip bro
3280,simplisticallysimple,"No doubt, but we all already know that. Like I said, there's a time and place for everything. And I hope this place wouldn't become a place for that. Men seem to have trouble discussing women ""dispassionately"" because most have been burned bad and can't shake off that bitterness. In the end, it devolves into women-bashing all over again, like r/MGTOW."

3283,MuleFool42,"I think that, over time, r/MGTOW2 will be more popular as it is the essence of what MGTOW should be, and not a bunch of fringe haters."
3284,nla6219,You are the first feminist i have ever heard say anything even remotely reasonable or sane. Im shocked and impressed. I dont know what else to say lol. Two thumbs up 👍👍😅
3285,alamsohel1990,true way to go
3286,cursed_deity,i don't think so because the first time got banned was because i gave the tip to not hate women but to simply ignore them and focus on bettering yourself
3287,IntellegoTheTrue1,Yeah that sounds like a reasonable thing
3288,cursed_deity,"come on, lets not use incel as an insult. 

we should be better as that"
3289,T0000009,"you can tell it's subversion of some kind, look at what get's posted now and the quality of the comments."
3290,FlintAustin,"Yup. I am pretty sure there is a woman somewhere there.

Some faggot admin found his way in but left his balls behind."
3291,FlintAustin,"The whole point for mgtow is men doing their thing and speaking their mind.

Some men will always have some reservations toward liking or disliking women that swings on extreme ends. But they have a very narrow approach.

Kind of good to be banned. Was being too pessimistic."
3292,Loban8990,I already have. Ive been a member of that sub from my other account since 2014 and a year on this one. Ive always followed thier rules so it is annoying to just be kicked out with no explanation. But whatever I unsubbed from there with both accounts.
3293,,Cause you sound like a dumb liberal fag to the mods in your comment thats explanation enough
3294,unblackmailable,"Maybe it's more simple than that.  Let me kick in an open door.  I don't think they ban you because they hate themselves, I think they ban just because they can.  What I believe at this point is, that one must present themselves as more than virtuous or you get cannibalised by your own kind, e.g. not red enough for a communist, not green enough for an environmentalist ... it's all very political in a sense that politics have become the new religion.  The Spanish inquisition didn't only burn demons, they got innocent people to."
3295,vHohenheim23,"It is stupid. You should be allowed to say whatever you want, exactly because it is a public domain. It's called freedom of speech/expression etc. 

So I guess the main question should be. Is reddit a platform(does not censor as they won't be forced to take responsibility for content made on their platform) or a publisher(a bunch of illiterates that censor opposition)...? Which one is it? 

It's even more disconcerting when the interpretation of ""racism/nazism"", ""women-hating"" etc gets left to a  bunch of overly sensitive man-children. 

What offends them, might not offend you or me. What they deem ""hatred"" might not be hatred at all. They just don't like the message, so they delete it and ban the user to silence any opposing opinions. 

Are homosexuals equal to the rest of us, or are they a protected class to the point where you'll get banned just for calling someone gay? Because that is what the latter looks like, that's then not ""equality"" like they bark the whole day, it's enforcing a ""protected class"". That's something entirely different, but that is the type of nonsense you get left with when a bunch of fruitcakes get to decide the ""rules"" everyone should ""abide"" at instead of leaving everyone to discuss issues, regardless of how ""offensive"" it is; like any supposed-to-be civilized nation."
3296,unblackmailable,"you're right.  I was thinking about a sword of Damocles that hangs over one's head when saying something slighty off, when I wrote it.  It came across totally differently.  But calling it stupid might not be correct either.  If it's stupid but it prevents a negative result...it's just ignorance."
3297,kittynovalove,You’re proving my point
3298,FlintAustin,"Monk mode is toxic? Not sure what interaction with others plays a factor here.

What is toxic is this notion of self-improvement masquerading some serious underlying desire to feel validated from others.

A monk has achieved far greater self-improvement living amidst the constant chaos."
3299,Pliyii,Because there isn't. There question answered. No need to get philosophical about it.
3300,WolverineDLogan,The moderating team must be full of those damn incels.
3301,ausgamer529,"My way is the only way I'm going from now on. I tried my best with women for years and it was height and looking too young that made relationships impossible with them. Now that I have a man in my life who loves me it is like a huge weight lifted from me. 
Thanks for the support brother"
3302,Azuzu88,"For a while I noticed quite a few guys speaking up about how the self-improvement posts had died out and all of the posts were about hating women, but they eventually dried up."
3303,MetaCognitio,"I stay on the fringes to be honest. I listen to what some of the youtubers and posters have to say, but the deeper parts of the MGTOW community have some really screwed up people (and some that aren't obviously). Some of these guys literally HATE women.

The fact that I got banned, the post has 34 upvotes and the guy has a daughter really bothers me. At least some of the replies are better. Although one spoke about that being the reason why there are selective abortions in India so they can have male children 🤮"

3314,AlanTheGr8,"Well yeah anyone who is smarter or better at anything is seen as a threat and not as a cohort/assett/friend and is instantly destroyed.

All the musicians jealous of my music or pua skills did everything the could to kneecap and ban me.

But what ur saying is a lil diff.

What ur saying is anything outside the norm must be eliminated. Like the japanese say the nail thar sticks uo must be hammered down."
3315,Ferg_NZ,You raise a good point.  If you are not extreme then you are treated as some sort of mutant.  There is nothing wrong with having empathy for other positions.
3316,Impossible-asset,"Context is important here. 

If you show up and start making posts about ""this is gay, that is gay, I might go eat some hay I can make things out of clay, and lay by the bay, I just may, whaddya say?""  Well, then your post would get removed and the mods would tell you at least what rule of the sub you were breaking. 

It you persist at it and constantly become a nuisance, then you should be shadow banned or temporarily banned. But you have to try pretty hard for that to happen here. 

As for freedom ot speech. Well, yes and no. We do want to encourage people to discuss things here, as long as it falls within the direction and purpose of the sub. And that is basically one that mgtow is a healthy life philosophy for men. 

Its not a place just bash on women or complain about access to or lack thereof of sex. It's for men who are walking a mgtow journey and want to talk with others who are doing the same, and offer advice or answer questions for men who would like to and have questions about it.  On topic discussion. 

If we just said ""hey it's a free speech bastion"" we'd end up with a meme-littered negativity fest and before long the sub would get shut down. 

So yes, the sub is moderated to keep the level of discussion elevated, for the benefit of all the subscribers. I hope that helps explain things a bit."
3317,Frelsi_8899,"I agree with everything you said, unfortunately, there's no fixing it. 

And it doesn't stop there. There's a mod on /r/infidelity that bans post just at the sheer mention of pronouns she deems unfit. Eg: Female. Until that sub I had no idea that some people consider the word female an insult. I just use it as a synonym for women. 

Same like I call women, birds, chicks, chicas, for the last few decades no one ever took offense. 

Problem is 1 foul moron, who's actually in charge of a pretty serious sub, which is the first sub people go to looking for information and support for infidelity, a VERY serious subject matter, are at the whim of some feminist with the emotional EQ of a 5-year-old and the mannerisms and maturity of a stubborn 19 year old. 

At no point do these people step back and just let the users of these subs get on with what they want. 

And does their policing really help? Well, no one likes to be policed. But if it hits the point where it's no fun anymore, or simply broken, that's when subs lose traction, and when that happens Reddit loses traction."
3318,IntellegoTheTrue1,If you monk till the point you can't talk and interact with people with some sort of self awareness there is no MGTOW group where you don't risk to be kicked out from. MGTOW is not about solipsism.

It is always best policy to be up front with your boundaries.

Those who disagree covertly, i.e. accept up front, but ""change their mind"" later,  
You can always go firmly back you having been already up front with her so you have yourself covered.

Thus as a gentleman and if you are interested it would have been  nice thing to do. In todays society there is alot of femists but keep in mind not everyone is and I dont think should change the way you approach women. Maybe she did back out because she wanted a free meal or maybe she didnt. Women are wired different than us. Maybe she just took it a little offensive. Either way, you shoot your shot with your women if you cant do an inexpensive meal after you were the one that asked her out. Than maybe you should wait till a girl asks you out. I dont mean anything in a bad way. A single meal wont kill you if its a girl that really interests you."

Women equate money to interest, weather or not you are a cheapskate and it generally just bruises there ego. Isnt always a problem but it doesn't help your cause.
The other night I was at a club and I asked these girls if they wanted to dance on the main dance floor and she said she would if I bought her friend a drink.

3389,Amphibole_,"But it's normal for women to want to be paid for. Their attraction is heavily based on being taken care of.

3392,hundakuten,Are you sure you're not looking for a PUA forum?
3393,Blexit2020,">She's just some woman with traditional values...

Exactly. I keep trying to tell some of y'all that you're gonna mess around and shoot yourselves in the foot because you're pushing away good women with Conservative, traditional values; likely women who have some kind of religious upbringing. Generally, not all, but *generally,* these types of women are anti-feminist and embrace their roles as women which is to be a help -meet to their husbands. I honestly don't know what else to say anymore, because it's not dissimilar from what feminists do to men and then complain about there ""not being any good men left."" Well, it's because all of the ""good men"" you want have traditional values, and your emasculating BS is a complete turn off to them. So, they walk away from or avoid you completely. 

It's the same with MGTOW/red pill men who are still dating for whatever reason. If you try to pull that ""true equality"" mess on a woman with traditional values, she's going to be turned off. That means, you just pushed away a woman that likely believes in submitting to her husband, the man being the head of the household, home cooked meals, washing your drawls, and keeping the marriage bed undefiled and satisfactory, and you being [the king of the castle](https://youtu.be/_e1Hw39C7lE). These women are also usually raised that approaching men is forward and unladylike, so the *only* way you can encounter her is if you do the courting. A woman that is ok with ""going dutch,"" NSA sex, hanging out in bars drinking and carrying on, is likely a feminist! The very type of person a lot of MGTOW men say they're actively trying to avoid. It's like they want a woman with traditional values, but feminist behaviors. It don't work that way, pimpin' lol. You either get a lady with traditional values whom you have to present with equally traditional values or you get a feminist. Those are your options if you choose to date instead of going monk. 

There are a lot of good men and women out there who want to love and connect with someone and start a family. And feminists and MGTOW cats are gonna mess around and push good candidates away because they're trying so hard to ""beat the system"" and prove a point. Once you've gotten to a point where you're actively blocking your own blessings, it is *then* that you've become a slave to the system. I've seen this happen in person. This girl got mad because this guy who was interested in her opened the door for her. This guy's a complete gentleman and a darn good catch. He has very traditional values and will make an excellent husband and father some day. And this heifer had the nerve to get mad because he opened doors for her? She sure didn't get mad when he was paying for her meals and driving up his gas getting her to work every day, though. If I sound irritated, I am, because this is my little brother I'm talking about, and I didn't appreciate the way this girl did him at **all.**

Traditional values don't mix with feminism and MGTOW. So if you want to date and adhere to MGTOW, you're going to be relegated to the feminists you hate, because a woman with traditional values will be put off by you. Period."
3394,Ridewithme38,"Its not so much a game he's playing as he has a type. Just like you may not want to date a fat girl, he does not want to date a girl who doesnt contribute equally."
3395,KhajiitFL,"FYI: PUA != MGTOW

You're striking me as a PUA type that flies a MGTOW flag"
3396,Thotsithinknots,Np yea. You are correct. I've had 10s pay insist on paying their way. You stuck to your guns. Respect. I'm the same way. Draw that hard line.
3397,Amphibole_,"Just because he isn't completely ignorant to the dating scene doesn't mean he's involving himself in it. 

Did you know that some people go MGTOW as a response from learning red pill theory, opposed to just blindly going along without understanding the social dynamics relating to it?"
3398,Amphibole_,"You make a good point, but I think it's too easy to say traditional = good, equality = bad. 

I mean the above is 'probably' true if you want a long term relationship like your brother, but the reverse is true for men who don't want one, and are just interested in the short term right?

And the OP rejected someone for holding traditional values, indicating he just wanted someone for the short term. 

I would argue that short term isn't worth it, especially given the type of people who want equality, as you said. But the same goes for long term. Just because they're traditional, doesn't mean it's a good deal, nor does it mean they're any different from most other women at heart (AWALT). It's up to each individual (who dates) to decide which they want, and if they go for the reverse, what more can they expect than to get hurt.

&#x200B;

I suppose there are also women who take this traditional perspective of wanting to be paid for, and then acting in every way non-conservative. I think that's the reason for the OP to make this thread. He's trying to warn us of women who kinda chameleon traditionalism to exploit mens' wallets?

 

But again, the OP indicated to the woman he wants something short term (equal pay), and she rejected on terms that either (1) she doesn't want short term, or (2) she's chameleoning traditionalism for a free meal.

So, is he warning us of (1) or (2)... well he never found out which one she was, so it's all too likely she's simply traditional. Leaving me to ask, why did he make this thread and why is everyone pretending there is a lesson to be learnt from his story?"
3399,,"Men paying for dates ended when women largely entered the workforce in ww1 and ww2. Now, there is no reason for not go half on dates."
3400,Amphibole_,"When I said he's playing a game, I was referring to him trying to go on dates with women. All that 'nonsense', it is all just part of what women are, and these things repel MGTOW individuals. 

&#x200B;

But if the OP wants to date that's fine and it's on him. He can want a relationship with someone who pays for themself. But it goes both ways. She can also want someone who pays for her. 

The difference is he wants equality, and she doesn't. But if you want a sustainable relationship, equality is irrelevant, as attraction is asymmetrical. Again, it's up to him but just don't complain about what you're choosing to engage in."
3401,Amphibole_,"What did I say that makes you think so, and why? I'm a MGTOW who never dates or anything of the like, nor do I intend to ever in the future.

I'm arguing that the dating scene is asymmetrical for biological reasons, and if people choose to date, this is something that they must accept. Personally, this would be a downside to dating but as a MGTOW, I don't date so idgaf and idk who in this sub would care."
3402,Thotsithinknots,I would even tell her she should be ashamed of herself its 2019!
3403,bunnytron,"Usually when the girl insists on paying for herself, it means she is not interested and has friend-zoned. But I also know of many exceptions where if the man is unemployed/underemployed or they’re college-aged that going Dutch is common practice"
3404,hundakuten,"Man, you make me cringe so hard"
3405,Blexit2020,"I was being very general when I said good men/women have traditional values. Obviously, people are individuals and should be judged by their character. I wasn't so much stating that people with traditional values are usually ""good people to be in relationships with"" as I was stating that people who are good candidates for relationships usually have traditional values. Does that make sense?

All in all, I, too, am unsure what the exact message OP is trying to convey, here. To draw parallels with feminists again, it's like complaining that there are men out there who have the ""nerve and audacity"" to expect a woman to be more submissive, feminine, and allow him to lead. It just sounds like a typical situation of encountering someone who doesn't share your values and with whom you're incompatible. That's...*normal.* There's nothing wrong with having traditional values, and if one doesn't want to adhere to traditional values, they have every right to look elsewhere. But there's no reason to ring the proverbial alarm and ""warn"" others that people with traditional values exist. Even if the intent was to imply the ""chameleon theory"" it's still unnecessary. That's like saying, ""Beware of ""smiling faces."" Sometimes people are nice to others just to get what they want out of them."" Naw, really, lol?

>Just because they're traditional, doesn't mean it's a good deal, nor does it mean they're any different from most other women at heart (AWALT). 

That's very true. But it is a good temperature gauge, for sure.

Maybe it's because I'm a socially awkward weirdo, but I'll never understand why so many people who claim to be tired of being generalized by certain groups then proceed to generalize others themselves. Literally every demographic does this ad nauseam; *especially* these past few years. I swear, depending on the subject matter, every online discussion involves some variation of the following:

White people always...

Black people always...

Conservatives always...

Liberals always...

Immigrants always...

[Insert religious group here] always...

Men always...

Women always...

Do you ever think that we'll get to a point in society where we start judging people based upon *who* they are instead of *what* they are? The fact that humans are even managing to coexist anymore with this type of thinking being so widespread is nothing short of a miracle. I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop, because it's like everyone is just sick of everyone now, lol."
3406,Impossible-asset,Pretty much this.
3407,KhajiitFL,">Their attraction is heavily based on being taken care of.

Hallmarks of pick-up artistry."
3408,BilboBagginhole,Go back to r/MGTOW with that shit.  Nothing said here should make you cringe.
3409,Amphibole_,"Uh-huh, that's right. 

Both your posts are aggressive with no argumentative value. 

I'd ask why you're even here but looking at the quality of your speech, I'm scared that you'll call me a poo poo head or something..."
3410,Amphibole_,"Honestly, I haven't really noticed much generalising of groups directly. I mean there is a strong media agenda against straight white males in games and movies and all that, but it's a bit specific..

I'm trying to think of what it's most similar to and I just come up with the general dislike of people who are in a different category to yourself, or really just people who have different opinions.

But at the same time, the internet makes it so much easier to avoid it and only speaking to people who hold the same opinions. Take MGTOW for example, even with a heavy social rejection of MGTOW, it's easy to find this sub.

This leads me to the next point, that even within the groups there may be differences in opinion. But a ridiculous proportion of society are ignorant in many ways. They don't look to correct fallacies in their arguments, or find problems with their behaviour to improve. 

What I'm getting to is that most people who dislike people for having different opinions, are also almost always going to confide in their own group, where they will choose to avoid discussions of any disagreements. This provides them with a safe place, so they won't have a strong need to leave their group to attack others (too frequently). For this I don't think there will be any major repercussions on a societal level. 

Having said this, it feels like the topic is too vague for my answer to hold any meaning. but at the same time, I'm thinking that there can't just be a reason for society to crumble, but there must also be a sufficient driving force. Enough people have to respond in a particular way, and I don't see this happening."
3411,Amphibole_,"I don't care if it's a hallmark of anything. I'm saying what I think is true.

As a middle-aged lifelong feminist, the RPR nearly destroyed me. Having a place to just vent like mad, even if it was kinda a craphole, was extremely beneficial. Sometimes a person really does just need to bitch about things, before they can move on. It supplied that. 

It honestly reminded me of some of the trauma-recovery forums that I used to frequent."
3424,MachoNacho031,Funny how MGTOW is gone but female dating strategy is alive and well
3425,gaucho2005,">lots of angry incels

You got that right."
3426,LongjumpingChance,"the mods at mgtow are pure inbreds who ban people who question anything at all. glad they got nuked.

they actually damage the reputation of mgtowers with their nazi-like silence of dissent"
3427,Paskalis1,👍🏻👌🏻
3428,anubhav23,It actually made me realise the truth everyone was afraid to speak out.
3429,Herbivore4Life,"It is odd (and actually sad) that you have to learn that it is OK to not get married and have a family. 

I have always dreaded having to do that, but figured it was what everyone did and if not you are a failure. It was such a immense feeling of relief when I realized a few years ago, that No, I don’t have to do any of that. Fuck what society says."
3430,veasel79,"Nah, I was just saying thanks. I think it’s unacceptable bullshit that anything male gets quarantined and the subs such as u named don’t have to succumb to that standard. 

I saw some red pill rage on OG but very few actually disturbing things.  Men do not poses a space anywhere including reddit to vent . 

Too many ppl join subs to troll, or get all righteous like some ahem unmentioned offshoots of OG and they complain and cause trouble to either have it removed or molded in the image they deem it to be . 

So in finale another thanks to all the dudes that commented, posted , and made me laugh, keep perspective on what I was going through and everything else.

Love ya all brother ✌️"
3431,wishiwasthruhikin117,I agree. It’s only going to make people more vocal. It’s not about the Mgtow title. It’s about men learning to respect themselves again.
3432,MGTOWJayJay,“Fake Mgtows” lol
3433,DavidLoPan13,"It was always things I suspected but everyone would just call me cynical. Oh just keep trying. You will meet the right one. Yeah, I’m kinda done with that. Relationships are exhausting."
3434,DavidLoPan13,When I first came discovered mgtow and started researching all the info I knew it was correct. Because almost everything mgtow expresses matched up to my life experiences and what I was observing around me. All the advice I got from friends and loved ones never matched up to reality.
3435,Bubba421,"MGTOW is really about enjoying yourselves even without the company of women, not hating women."
3436,gaucho2005,"I don't know what you mean by that, but your username is telling me it probably isn't good."

3464,MyLittlePonyofDoom,They don’t make em like that in Australia
3465,MajIssuesCaptObvious,"What van did you use, and what about repairs and reliability? How much was it to get the van-home built, in time and dollars? I'm sure it was less than the total cost of having to buy a car plus first month's rent and deposit .

You're doing it right, man. Congrats so much. Your sacrifices have paid off. It sounds so cool, I bet they don't even feel like sacrifices, though, lol.

What do your family and friends think of it all, van life and the home purchase? And the fact that no dating is what made it all possible?"
3466,,"Not really. Can’t be more that 1,200 sq ft or so"
3467,Impossible-asset,"Sure. I did comptia A+, Network +, Security +, and Server +. 

Working on MCSA now."
3468,Impossible-asset,"It was much, MUCH easier than I thought it would be to pull off. 

I looked at what I had: lots of expenses, chasing each payday, going nowhere.

I sat down and said ""what will I need to DO in order to be able to afford my own home."" The answers were:

1. Get more education to get passed that HR door.

2. Be willing to leave california and GO to where the job is. 

3. Live minimalist for a while to save money. 

Vanlife took care of the minimalism along with not spending as much money getting laid. No rent is a big advantage. 
The education came from ""oh, not at work? Cool, study. Hit the gym, then study.""
Willing to move was ""oh theres that job offer in coal-tar West Virginia or Flat-snows North Dakota? I'm in. 

And it just turns out that being willing to do that got me where I am now, and this house just plopped into my lap. 

You can make it happen bro."
3469,Impossible-asset,"It is. But I built it to be somewhat stealthy. Just another plumber or painter or florists van just sitting in the parking lot or on the street with all the other Van's that sit there overnight. 

I insulated it for the cold, put in an indoor-safe heater to help keep it comfy. I installed solar panels and batteries so I could run my fridge and indoor lights and phone chargers. Put in a clean and grey water tank and a 12v pump so I could have running water, and a propane stove so I could prepare simple meals like eggs or make tea and such. Toilet was a home depot bucket with pipe insulation for a seat. 

All in all, it was pretty comfortable living. I even put in a twin size mattress. 

And while I'm watching a study video for a certification, or lord of the rings, or sleeping, to anyone passing by, it's just another white van.

And I moved it around. One night its walmart supercenter, the next an industrial street, then a hotel parking lot where there are lots of other Vans. If I was feeling really ballsy, I'd just stay in the parking lot at work. Lots of people in and out there so no need to be alarmed. 

It was fun, and I know that I can do it successfully in the future if I need to. But now, it can just be for fun camping someplace."
3470,,What are you talking about?
3471,Impossible-asset,"Sure. But that's everywhere. I dont know of any place that doesnt have property taxes. Some places have higher rates than others. 

On this one, the taxes come out to about $700 or so a year. I dont want to own something that isnt making me money so my plan is to have part of it be an office for my home-based business, have another part pay for itself either with a tenant or with a hobby that can also be profitable. 

I'd rather pay a few hundred in taxes per year than pay the entirety of someone elses mortgage for them in a rental."
3472,Impossible-asset,"I did my build in a dodge ram promaster. 2017 model year so the van was a little pricey, but I know that it will do fine in adverse road conditions. Also it has the front wheel drive so better stability on wet roads. 

They say the annual cost of ownership for that model year is about $500, so I'm good with that. 

It took about three weeks to do the build, with the solar power setup costing the most BY FAR. About 3k, but I have enough power and batteries to last a full week of apocalyptic darkness and a ray of sunshine will charge them to full. 

As for tjme, it was a lot of time, but me and my dad were just having fun doing the build together, with frequent hardware store runs and bbq. 

Family and friends and coworkers thought I was batshit insane, until they saw the finished build. Then the script was flipped and they thought it was a great idea once the ""where do you park and poop?"" Problems were addressed. 

I'll admit on some nights when it was getting down to zero, it would get a little chilly, maybe 58 degrees. But still glad I did it and have the van, now for fun, and necessity if needed."
3473,ragnar_graybeard87,"Wow lots of work. Great job, man."
3474,BluePillCypher,👍🏾🙂
3475,MajIssuesCaptObvious,"Wow. Just... wow! What an awesome post. You are living the dream. Whenever you miss vanlyfe, you can just go sleep in the van in you're driveway, lol."
3476,Impossible-asset,"Thanks. In total the journey from ""dead end job barely squeaking by in a studio apartment in los angeles"" to ""I own my own home and have a career now"" has been less than 24 months."
3477,Impossible-asset,"Oh I plan on travelling to do a lot of sight-seeing. And wherever I go, I wont be paying for any expensive hotels. Saves half the cost of the trip tight there. 

Vanlife has some drawbacks, but it is a lot of fun."
3478,ragnar_graybeard87,That's extremely inspiring. Appreciate you sharing with us and of course keep up the good work.
3479,Impossible-asset,"100% this. Focus on the positive and yourself in explanations, and not ""because women do (x)""."
3480,Pliyii,Yep. Attacking woman-kind while stating the reason that you're not in a relationship just shows where your mind is in respects to that.
3481,,[deleted]
3482,EnslavedOpethFan053,I just say I enjoy being single and have no intentions of changing it anytime soon.
3483,mgtowyear4,"Why even explain. Smile, play to their narratives, shake hands, do what you want."
3484,FlourishedCass,I've always held the belief that those who need mgtow will find it organically.
3485,magx01,"Yup, exactly what I do. I usually just say something to the effect of ""I seem to flourish when I am not in a relationship.....I'm wired differently I guess."""
3486,GlobalAsshat,"I come on the internet because I dont want to talk about myself. That's all normal people talk about all day long is each other.  He did this, she did that, I did this, they did that... Basically just a bunch of stories that I generally dont have a lot of interest in I will admit, though in order to develop people skills you do have to fake interest. (No, I'm not that much fun at parties.)
 
 Internet forums are a haven for snarky intellectuals and introverts to gather and discuss ideas.  I get stimulation pondering the deeper issues in life, as opposed to which bar or restaurant I'm going to go to a co-worker with or how such and such a co-worker is so hot or whatever they talk about. Its always about other people.

Dont get me wrong I dont think I'm superior because I'm an ideas person, I just dont care about talking about people all day long. It is fascinating to see the reaction of these people when you bring up something intellectually stimulating. Their eyes glaze over in the same way. Clearly they get their stimulation discussing people.

I guess it stems from not having many friends in childhood. Most people will banter as adults in a similar manner to how they did it as kids. There are so many examples at work with both genders... This is why I say people dont have as much free will as they think they do...observing human behavior and researching psychology.... Its fascinating to watch personalities develop in young kids even from the same parents... You can do things to change yourself but it does seem the level of dominance and submissiveness a person has is part genetic, probably why women instinctually seek out strong men.

Number one reason to get over the red pill rage... You're getting mad at evolution and DNA."
3487,screaminjj,BuT mUh FeMiNaZiS!
3488,dreadnaut91,"Mgtow has let me get my shit together. That makes people jealous but they don't want to accept that women just suck now. I've been meeting a lot of people recently and they are all blown away by what I've done in the last few years. Every argument they throw at me I just respond with ""I'm doing just fine on my own"". I'll just continue to be the best example of mgtow I can and hopefully people follow."

3490,Gordon-G,Men Guarding Their Own Wallets MGTOW
3491,Platinum247365,"I need to remind myself of this from time to time. When I get asked why I'm not dating or don't have a gf, I want to say that I want to improve myself and enjoy my freedom. I don't say ""women do x"" as someone else said, but I tend to rant about how bad marriage is. I need to focus on the positive."
3492,UTRuser74,"Or don’t explain anything to anyone. IOW, go your own way."
3493,TigPlaze,I don't tell anyone I'm MGTOW.  It's none of their business.
3494,AlanTheGr8,"Although the question comes up from time to time and has some merit, it is also an oxymoron. Why would someone go their own way if there wasn't a reason they were essentially forced/burned/rejected into going their own way? I think it's pretty rare that someone wakes up and just decides to go their own way WITHOUT being forced/burned/screwed into it due to how horrible modern relationships going awry. They may claim that they are doing it ""just because"" but I really doubt that is the case. The real case is men are going their own way because the risks of being with women are too high"
3495,semiamusinglifter,"Maybe this comment doesn’t exactly fit the scenario of which you’re speaking about, but whenever I explain my personal stance on marriage, it’s more about helping the people that have made a difference in my life. I would much rather spend part of my life to improve the last years of my parents and grandparents rather than some stranger who hasn’t added any value to my life."
3496,Jagabong,"Two rules in my book:  
1. First rule in MGTOW ""club"", don't talk about being MGTOW. It's your life, it's your decisions, and I don't give a shit about anyone else opinions in that matter.

2. If asked about my celibacy, I just tell I haven't found the ""one"" yet(even though I know obviously AWALT), and that's the way it is. I prefer not to talk about the fact I prefer to be alone and improve myself and strive for self-betterment. I think I would then considered either a bit weird or a douche(choosing that lifestyle over family life). And if someone tries to hook me up with a girl, I would just tell that she's either not my type or something like ""I don't want to see a girl this moment, it's complicated, no thanks"" in an awkward or an introverted way.

I just want to emphasize about the second point that virtually, if someone(a male) asks me about my celibacy(and not a family member in a dinner table or that manner), it's probably because that person wants to boast about his family/about his girlfriend/about his fuck-count. Obviously, because truly, he actually feels bad about it or just craving for attention to validate his pathetic ego and not-meaningful life."
3497,gopher_glitz,Know plenty of guys that are mgtow but they've never heard of mgtow
3498,throwd444444,"Let's be clear, not very many people give a shit. 

Once you realize that you'll know how to answer questions. You'll know what information to volunteer and how much of it. 

It took me far too long to realize that questions like ""How was your weekend?"" are best answered with one or two words ""Great actually!"" Most likely Bob or Mary from the office really do not give a fine fuck about how exactly you spent your weekend. 

Same applies for your lifestyle choices. Remember they don't really give a fuck, but everything you say can and will be used against you. So less is more. And not answering is fine too. 

You are not obliged to answer every question, likewise, you don't have to explain yourself. Since most people don't give a fuck anyways, they're easy to get off your back with one-word replies, most of the times. Even an ironic look works from time to time."
3499,BludgeonVIII,It's the same reason why a lot of people don't like vegans who only talk about being a vegan.
3500,jaymuralee,"We all know this, don't we? But it is important because it's our biggest weakness. Improving your life would be a goal, but then there has to be something bigger to replace the instinct to copulate and procreate."

3502,SullenBol,Absolutely. I think that's where guys go wrong with that situation.
3503,SullenBol,I see your point.
3504,Pliyii,"While I technically know this (he'll I've defended the red pill rage a couple of times) it's always good to be reminded of the reality of things. Hope those that feel rage can soon feel fulfillment instead.

And to add. I think that's why it brings misery (as per your last sentence). Precisely because it ruins our blue-pill plans/goals. Yet almost all of us just get bored of being angry and go back to optimizing life for enjoyment, even if our past desires are no longer in need of fulfillment"

People really don't know what they want or don't want...they just want what happens to be different from the status quo at any given time (grass is always greener syndrome, getting bored with the familiar), because they create these fantasy realities they think will be better than the way things are, but they end up not being.  I try to remember that when I get annoyed at how nanny state governments seem to be or I'm stuck at stoplights or in slow traffic."
3510,SullenBol,lol
3511,SullenBol,"It's easy to talk about marriage if you're asked specifically about it and not just relationships. But as you say, it's good to focus on the positive."
3512,SullenBol,wise.
3513,SullenBol,"Yeah, i have a friend who always thinks i'm single because women did something to me. But even if one of them did, i don't really remember it. Before i learned about MGTOW, i just used to think that guys who avoided women because they were burned before were really cowards and it was pathetic. But that was just my blue pill brain rationale. Today, with the red pill knowledge, i don't judge. But at the same time, i never really looked at the risks and benefits of women. I just got used to being single and now i don't see anything wrong with it. It's only an opportunity for me to focus on myself. Ergo, why i don't even mention women when explaining my lifestyle."
3514,firewhichblazeth,Lol I think your last paragraph is so true
3515,AlanTheGr8,Well maybe ur younger...but either way ur aware of dangers and that is a prime motivator

3561,TheMF-J,"It’s blatantly obvious symbolism.  ‘Clownworld’ and ‘88’ is just too much of a coincidence; clownworld is not a very popular term outside of this context.  It’s like if someone was waving a red swastika flag and then saying “you realize Hinduism is a thing, right?”"
3562,VladimirOkanovic,"I mean Lumbi, how did he become mod on the sub"

It can come from both sides, I've seen both mothers and fathers project this Queen/princess/golden child bullshit onto their kids who soak it up.

For example, someone I know has two kids, and is recently divorced. His wife calls HERSELF a queen/princess and is now teaching their daughter to act the same way during the 5 days of the week she gets custody. It is becoming a problem for the husband who doesn't want her turning out like her mother for very obvious reasons. 

Otherwise he doesn't give his kids any labels, just supports them in their interests and gives them love and care.

I don't know anyone personally who is a father that does the whole princess routine, but for sure I have seen it from afar, so I agree with you on that, but not that it is entirely men who do it."
3570,the40yearoldincel,"It's a perfect storm that's been brewing for several decades. I remember even in elementary school back in the 1980's, teachers and parents telling girls that they were princesses that should be worshipped by men, and that they are the future.

Several decades of this nonsense, add modern feminism and the #MeToo movement into the mix, and a dash of technology and online dating now the norm, women have grown to be extremely entitled and immature. Just look at how they choose to date men, the kind of men the pick, and their social media accounts alone just show their level of immaturity and shallowness.

The sad fact is, is that our culture needs to change. Even if we could start tomorrow, re-educting young women that acting like wh0re$ and treating average looking men like ATM's and pushovers to be used for their own agenda, it would decade at least another 40 to 50 years for that mentality to change."
3571,Gordon-G,Men add fuel to the fire.. Gynocentric society that places women on a pedestal does the rest
3572,henriduf,"You are right.

The root cause of the problem are male blue-pilled fools.

They spoil their daughter, their wife, their girlfriend, their female coworkers, female strangers, female students.

1. Fathers spoil their daughter. They solve their problem on their behalf. They drive them home when they need to....
2. Boyfriends spoil their girlfriend
3. Husbands spoil their wife
4. Sons spoil their mother
5. Brothers spoil their sister

Today, in our society men always care about women, and they get nothing in return.

In the western world, men dedicate their life to women."
3573,RedPillMissionary,"As usual, I'd say it's the government.  Women win in divorce court.  They win custody battles.  They win in criminal court.  They win the welfare game.  They win the 'gender quota' game in the hiring process.  They win the 'gender quota' game in college admissions.  They win scholarships just for being women.  They win more attention on social media.  They win at the voting booth.   

&#x200B;

So sure, men built this government, but it isn't the fault of one man in their life, rather society in general."

3575,artographic,"Men didnt used to always spoil their daughters.  There was a time where important values were forced upon her and she was taught to respect and understand them.  Now its just no accountability or responsibility taught along with those values being completetly gone.   Not to mention the big problem being the culture itself is toxic and cancerous and since women reflect their culture in their civilizations its no wonder why we are going our own way.  

The juice isnt worth the squeeze and the investment could kill a man.  All it takes is one bad woman who says shes a good girl."

From there, we do a cost/benefit of what makes sense based on the reality of modern life. **FROM THAT**, we can conclude that marriage/co-habitation has become a losing proposition for men.

That's why I always try to stress that MGTOW is a **positive** philosophy about self-actualization rather than a **negative** philosophy about being anti-marriage. Being for pro-male self-actualization is the essence; being anti-marriage is the conclusion."

The State takes around 5% of each transaction for the services rendered (i.e. the legalized robbery at the point of the gun) which makes the budget of the Family Courts (aka ""The Divorce Tribunals"") to be over $50 billion (that itself is more than the budgets of ALL other ""real"" courts COMBINED).

3702,Luluch_VII,"Still it is misleading and probably may have negative consequences for you as well.

Porn is dangerous. Even if it is not problematic as much as narcissistic women, it can still damage your psyche."
3703,Luluch_VII,"Well you are right but googling things shouldn't be that hard.

https://www.nhs.uk/news/neurology/watching-porn-associated-with-male-brain-shrinkage/

There are various studies which link porn usage to mood and memory problems. It is not even a rarely discussed phenomenon. Neuroscience seems to come up with pretty solid evidence.

It is up to you which studies have more convincing arguments."

3705,firebrace451,"Hey man as someone who tries to watch porn ""responsibly"" I get what you are saying.  The OP is saying porn cured his ""addiction to women"" but isn't accounting for the diminished lack of pleasure also carried over to the ""non-women"" aspects of life."
3706,IAmJacksGagReflex,"Right, so this study was published by the Daily Mail, a site that some would consider to be of questionable credibility.  Also, according to the article, it is a ""small study"" (therefore likely not an accurate representation or peer reviewed) and it is a *cross-sectional* study, not a *control group* study.  According to the definitions on the [same site](https://www.nhs.uk/news/health-news-glossary/#crosssectionalstudy);

>***...because this study doesn't look at time trends, it can't establish what causes what.***

All things considered, I'm not convinced.  Allow me to provide another example.  This the title of [this article](https://neurosciencenews.com/neuroscience-pornography-brain-15354/) is ""*Watching pornography rewires the brain to a more juvenile state*"", yet it cites a [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1874574) that I can only assume the author didn't think the readers would bother to read because it undermines, if not outright contradicts her argument.

>...*However, the observed volumetric association with PHs in the striatum*  ***could likewise be a precondition rather than a consequence of frequent  pornography consumption.*** *Individuals with lower striatum volume may need  more external stimulation to experience pleasure and might therefore  experience pornography consumption as more rewarding, which may in turn  lead to higher PHs. Future studies should investigate the effects of  pornography longitudinally or expose naïve participants to pornography  and investigate the causal effects over time to provide further evidence  for the proposed mechanism of intense exposure to pornographic stimuli,  resulting in a downregulation of the reward system.*

Which do you find more convincing?  Just because something is frequently discussed, it doesn't make the arguments valid if they aren't supported by proper research by experts.  And no, neuroscience hasn't come up whith an argument that I've been able to find that supports what you're saying that has convinced this layman yet, and I'm open to being convinced.  All I've found is more information that proves your argument ideological, religious and political, but not at all  supported by science."
