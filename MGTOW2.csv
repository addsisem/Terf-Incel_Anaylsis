9,ThePanther1989,"Just add a weight room, a walk in humidor, a cellar, and I am set. Keep in mind, if I let a woman move in...those three things would be gone; at the very least, she would demand that I get rid of my weights and the walk in humidor, and try to have her gaggle of girlfriends over constantly to raid the cellar and drink me dry! Trust me, if you move a woman in..she will try it..your peaceful home will be a distant memory! Your life and your peace of mind above any woman! Go your own way!"

25,Sarm11111,"Once i kept my main room/living room nicely decorated by a buddy wife.  I had kept it up and put all my man things in the basement, like a big screen, my desk, pc ,,you get it.  And I‚Äôll admit it  was to have an area that I could entertain women.  Over time and a few shitty relationships I  started asking myself the tough questions and first was do I really want a women moving in or marriage for that.  I have always had a very low trust factor for women. And without going into it the lack of trust stemmed from some very criminal things by women, that no one would believe.  I wasn‚Äôt an INCEL, far from it, but after the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù I retreated and stopped dating.  And witnessed other warning signs with friends and coworkers .  So I asked those questions, do I really want to have a wife/women in my life to the extent of bring them home or marrying, and the answer was no, hell no.  So I bought a huge screen, cut a hole in the dinning room table to mount a tv in to play games with friends, decorated my walls with dragon heads, swords , and so on.  So now my man cave is my whole house and I vouknr care less what any women would say, because I‚Äôll probably be pushing them out the door to a cab.and I love my childish dungeon."

Whatever, maybe your father is a fucking tard and he deserves what happened, then if so, why the fuck would you call it divorce rape? It's as if you are excusing the horrible act of divorce rape and just shrugging your shoulders, like as if to say ""whatever, wasn't me who got screwed over, thus the system works""."

Another example, I've given male friends the possibility to ""earn"" some alms by selling some of my stuff online ""on commission"".  He earned it and did something useful for me."
79,jenovajunkie,"Employing your friend is not the type of support I mean, I would think ""employing your friend"" isn't quite the same either.

I'm a bit confused, how men know that divorce and marriage has the potential to screw over a man, why don't men stick together more like how feminists do. That kind of support, that's what I'm getting at."
80,unblackmailable,"I know you are, we're all on this subreddit with the best of intentions.  I get it.

89,LetsGoAllTheWhey,"Just read a post on /r/askreddit asking what is the most appropriate way to compliment a woman.  The answers, in summary, were that the sentences had to be structured a certain way (ex. compliment her choices such as what she's wearing, not how it makes her look). The compliment should be delivered in a certain tone of voice, given at the appropriate time. etc etc etc.  It's far, far more trouble than it's worth.  

Why jump through all those hoops in an attempt to be nice?  It's so much less trouble and stress to just ignore them and walk away.  I'm so glad I did."

Why do we think they have labeled all MRAs misogynist, all MGTOW as incels and pedophiles? Why did they try to ban the ""Red Pill"" documentary? 

&#x200B;

Show of hands kids, who has the answer? 

&#x200B;

Feminism exist today only as a function of censorship, and that is exactly why they try to paint you guys with that brush, to silence you and redirect from your argument.

&#x200B;

Look, I'm an MRA, but not MGTOW. I'm married, long term (I found a great one from a previous generation- well I may be MGTOW because I did go my own way), but the message is as clear as if it were a written like a flash burnt across the sky, and the only way it can be defended is by calling you ""misogynist"" or some other vile name so as to dismiss you and silence the conversation, keep people from looking up.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately there are too many women out there starting to agree, and as Dr. Smith stated, ""if men are not allowed to speak, I will speak for them"". I had a phone conversation recently with one of the most notable women in the MRM, and even she replied to my comment that ""I don't subscribe to women bashing"" with, ""well, society and women have a lot to account for"".  

&#x200B;

Feminism is quickly becoming a joke, a cliche', fodder for parody...and this issue is exactly why. The guys comment was fucking brilliant."
100,30203forever,"And by ""family courts"" you mean the ""Divorce tribunals""? Because they're neither ""family"" nor ""courts"", IMHO...."
101,30203forever,"I agree with what you wrote. Personally, I define feminism as the political movement of the sub-par females to leverage their vote in order to get their hands on the resources which they ""deserve"" but are not able or unwilling to get the traditional way (i.e. scamming the males out of their money under the current gynocentric laws). And they're using their phony ""victimhood"" because it helps greatly with that. The ""equality"" which the feminists are constantly harping about is actually the ""equality of outcome"" along the lines of: ""that woman was able to secure a good husband &/or job and  I was not; therefore, it's obvious that the patriarchy is oppressing me and I deserve to be compensated by society for being persecuted."" That's how the feminists really think and that's the very reason why you never argue with them: it's next to impossible to make someone understand something when their income depends on NOT understanding it. IMHO, the equality of outcome (i.e. communism) is not equality at all and I'm talking from personal experience, actually. As Aristotle said 2.5K years ago, ""The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal."" The feminism is evil in its most basic form and must be fought with everything we'we got because if it wins, the men will become the abject slaves, no doubt about it...."

104,DJ-Roukan,"That was pretty brilliant, guy."
105,WildChad,"I have come to the exact same end conclusion that feminism, the way it trends, leads to re-introduction of slavery as it ultimately desires to have the power to arbitrarily call any sexual act a criminal offense whenever it wants - Only dictators are in the same position as the power they have is to command the hand of the law according to their will - In its completion this would reduce men to a slave class while women would be elevated to noble citizenry / master class, just like Ancient Greece and Rome had a slave class of sub-humans who were there to do all the work that could be exploited in any way on the whim of the master class citizens.  


This is the end game agenda, even if not conscious one, of feminism.  
In other words, even if well intended, this is the automatic final state if feminism does not meet enough resistance."
106,DJ-Roukan,"You are not alone my friend. Most people have not heard a great many truths about feminism...because they have become so adept at the lie, have so much power, they can not only censor the movie, but the very fact that they did censor it.  They censor the truth, then they hide the truth, then they hide the fact that they hid the truth.

&#x200B;

Most people that I speak with on line, that still believe that feminism is about equality and not a hate group aimed at men, are so naive of the truth, have so little understanding, that it would take ten posts to bring them up to speed.

107,30203forever,I agree with that too ;)
108,30203forever,"Yep. The end goal is to enslave the hated bottom 80% ""below average undesirable"" men while using the top 20% as their playthings. I can picture a group of the landwhales lying lazily around a picnic table, picking on some grapes & cheese, washing them down with gallons of wine while bitching bitterly that ""You can't get an honest day's work out of those slaves anymore..."" The truth of the matter is that no less than 80% of all women (probably over 90%) would support such a system wholeheartedly..."

111,WildChad,"Indeed as almost nobody is able to resist having absolute power over other people on moral basis alone.  


I just wrote a separate post illustrating the dangers of this inspired by this conversation and another one I had yesterday:  


[https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW2/comments/cget6a/the\_end\_state\_of\_feminism\_a\_female\_master\_class/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW2/comments/cget6a/the_end_state_of_feminism_a_female_master_class/)"
112,DJ-Roukan,You bet. Glad to help.
113,30203forever,">Maybe the femanuts try doing one of their ""studies"" on male Humor.

Not going to work because stupid people do not usually understand humor and hate the people who do (usually, the men). That's because the feminists are not only devoid of the sense of humor themselves, jealous of others who have it but are also very suspicious & fearful that people are joking at their expense (which is not entirely untrue...). As far as ""get a life"" goes, that's the core of the issue: they are feminists precisely because they can't get a life and NOT the other way around...."
114,30203forever,"I saw that post an agree with that. In addition, the females want the right to reinterpret consent post-factum and sometimes years or decades after the fact. Case in point: the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. Not only that, they want their claims to be judged to be ""true till proven false"" and not the other way around (i.e. #BelieveAllWomen). In short they want the end of the Due Process but only in one direction because ""reasons"". I have a simple solution to all that mindfuckery, at least on the personal level. Do not engage with any ""regular"" women in the West. Avoid them like the plague they are. To me, they are all the property of the state, their real daddy-husband and I do not mess with the government property.... P.S. You're ""better"" than me because I reported, blocked that person & forgot about it..."
115,DJ-Roukan,"and you are getting smarter every time I read you...

kidding of course, but dead on the money accurate."
116,WildChad,"Oh yeah, I didn't even remember post-factum which is horrible.

In the worst case not only you'd need to record all your sex acts with women, you'd have to store them forever - And when it comes to the current practices of divorce courts, evidence for the man is often completely ignored by the judge - So practically you'd never be safe even with consent.

I think you are completely right about ending Due Process, which is currently in the process of being eroded for women just because vagina.

And yes, avoid all BP women in the West and gauge actively for these belief systems in any women you engage with in order to stay safe."

If you have a drivers license, passport etc they have a photo of you and could use it to identify many more pictures of you on security cameras as you just go about your life. If you have a phone with a front facing camera it can see you every time you use the phone. It's too late to escape this now. Your face is on record and it will be abused."

Those trashtalkers not only missed the agenda of this sub but are assholes for criticising you like that."
163,NakedValhallaBoyyy,"I was a bit surprised just how upset they got over that sort of thing. I understand why they got upset, but I thought they'd at least fight that instinct with the whole going your own way bit. Not everyone who breaks away from the norm and goes their own way is going to go away they feel is preferred.

You don't need to embrace femininity though. We live in a time that people say you need to accept who you are as if that is unchangeable. I tried to just embrace it when I was a feminist and one day I looked at myself and felt like I was a caricature, that 'leaning into it' was just as much an act as trying to hide it.

There is a similar movement that says we need to accept our bodies as they are, but that isn't true. There are certain parts of you that you shouldn't try to force a change on, aspects that deal with your emotional well being and your happiness. But the way you pose, the way you speak, the words you use, how you dress, those are easily  changed things and more than one path can make you happy. These aren't 'who you are'.  These are just the cosmetics of behavior, things that can be easily changed to suit who you want to become."

195,MadPreacher1AD,Nicely done bud on the mega-thread. I support this idea to keep the posts about being banned from the cess pool that is MGTOW1.
196,Motorola_Nova,"Agreed.

Does being banned from r/MGTOW stop you from seeing all posts on there or does it just mean that you can't submit your own posts?"
197,GlobalAsshat,They seem to be banning constructive posts and encouraging the women hatred.   It does a disservice to men to be not exposed to material to help them get over their red pill rage.
198,BumKnickle,"MGTOW1 is a fucking joke, the mod team are such a bunch of idiots and they also are doing eveything they can to turn it into an echo chamber, and as we all know the instant you do that you collapse on the inside because you no longer have the ability to justify and reason your opinion.

MGTOW1 is Cancer."

200,Cryedra,I got banned for saying leaving someone elses child to rot is immoral.
201,Trek13,"got banned from r/mgtow twice.  Both times for criticizing  ""dear Leader"" (fucking Trump) in response to idiotic posts praising him.  Politics should be on the sidebar as not allowed and I mostly could ignore the Freeper types on that sub but over time the stupidity just got under my skin.   Also, too many ""victims"" there.  Pretty sure I pissed some people off pointing that out.  Sure, things are somewhat stacked against men in our society, especially white men right now, but if you stand back and objectively look at things it is mostly background noise.   I will take being a white male in this society any day, we are NOT oppressed and if you have half a brain it is not hard to compete and succeed.   Thank god I am not saddled from birth with the crutch of ""victimhood"" like women and other groups are.

And I can say as far as ""MGTOW"" as a concept, probably 90+% of of guys on r/mgtow are just not there.   It seems more of an AA for men in pain dealing with redpill truths.    I wish them goodluck in their pursuit of ""mgtow"", its not for everyone thats for sure.   But FFS keep the reich wing political BS out of it. 

 I say this as a 60 year old, never married, no kids, original ""confirmed bachelor"", retired early, financially independent ""loner"".    Lots of women in my past but could never let go of my freedom."
202,chrisdidwht,I got banned 6 months ago. My last post got over a thousand upvotes. I asked the mod why i was banned. He just mocked me. From what i observed they spend all their time trashing women. Thats not mgtow to me.

204,arealchillbrownie,"So, I just got banned from mgtow1 and I gotta say it's hilarious. I pointed out the difference between incels and mgtow and within 2 min got banned. So like any rational person I messaged the mods for an explanation. Naturally, radio silence ensued. I used to love that sub, it's sad to see it become so pathetic"
205,gopher_glitz,Got banned for saying a comic about transgenders seemed to have little to do with mgtow.  So fucking sensitive.
206,RhizonXXVII,"Not banned yet, but the negativity about women has gotten completely out of control. I saw a post about sex dolls and artificial wombs, upvoted to high heavens, and I am afraid it is a space that is just too focused on getting back at women. Always delving into all the negative sides of feminine nature as if there is NOTHING inherently good or beneficial from it. It's too much. I mean I want to protect myself, but I do not have to actively assume every woman is the spawn of... you get my point...."
207,-Ecliptic-,"> Did you just get banned from /r/MGTOW?

Why yes I did...I've never seen a more pathetic group than that.  Guess they need their safe space."
208,,"I left voluntarily. Too many self-defeatist foreveraloners that are not interested in self development. Not interested in sharing life strategies. Too eager to fall for the clickbait media. I've also been guilty of this in the past. It's very easy to get into the bitter loop concerning feminists. But brandishing all women as having the same agenda is just as stupid as a libtard saying all men are toxic. It serves no purpose. It brings nothing to the quality of your life. MGTOW subreddit in its current state is an echo chamber.

I've seen a conversion from when the incel subreddit got banned. Most of the MGTOWs who shared their wisdom are no longer on the subreddit. A MGTOW I met in London even calls them menimists and refuses to go back on there. A few good posters remain. But they are drowned out by the overwhelming outrage porn.

It's a sinking ship. And that's because visiting the subreddit leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. A hyper focus on the worst of female nature. The worst of society.

Men need male spaces though. Men need brotherhood. Is this subreddit got the markings to provide that? I'm not entirely sure at the moment. However, for me it's time to turn a new leaf. Get back to the original intention of MGTOW. It wasn't to shun yourself away from society. It was to avoid commitment aka marriage and anything that does not serve men on his path. It was to place your hobbies and interests at the forefront. To realise that you're more than just your biological imperative. And I kind of deviate here from most MGTOWs, I don't think hooking up with women is bad if you are smart about it. Essentially the first inception of MGTOWs were the single bachelor types. I think through MGTOW subreddit getting popular. With YouTubers echoing clickbait  like TFM reading out the horror stories of gynocentrism it's become a bastardised version of itself.

Anyways, just my thoughts."
209,,"They'll ban you if they think you're the Chad type.

So much inexperience with those guys on there, as a 34 year old who has been through a lot with women, they became pretty transparent.  Got easy to tell who hadn't been with a girl and who had. "

215,Liquid_Leopard,"Well, I always wondered what you had to get banned from /MGTOW and I found out! Apparently, well thought out answers and trying to have an adult conversation with mildly differing opinions is all it takes. "
216,yermanbob,"Just unsubbed at the same time as getting banned, apparently you can't ask why an idiot 20 year old got banned, I started to talk about the purity spiral and the creation of there own bubble vs free speech that I've seen kill many communities since athieism+

I predicted that sub will be going down within 18 months because they have lost focus on the welfare of men instead preferring to have a bitch fest at women. "
217,xpillx,"I just got banned from mgtow lol. They turned into a fucking hatred incel group. The amount of man jumping on high horse and virtue signaling there is astounding. I dont know a reason why I got banned. I had many good convos there but I guess ban was for 1 comment in thread where guy was virtue signaling to others about not wanting to fuck that chick he posted that actually looked amazing to me. I suggested that he hates looks too much and maybe he likes a dick in a butt. These guys turn into sjw feminazi that try to control freedom of speech. I dunno maybe they will make safety rooms for those incels soon too. There is a difference in not liking some women behavior and just her looks...
"
218,ArtDeve,I am relieved I finally got banned. /r/MGTOW is full of toxic and hypocritical incels.
219,NYLON_G,"I challenged a so called MGTOW on his slut shaming of an Asian female. I asked the question why he was so concerned about something he had no choice over and no control over.

His response was to launch into a personal tirade about doing whatever he wanted to do. He then attacked me personally and to top it off resorted to racial attacks. This from a MGTOW who has never met me and doesn't know anything about me.

I am convinced that r/MGTOW has been feminised and corrupted by feminists and anti-MGTOW shills. To be banned from the subreddit for having a discussion about MGTOW while the racist idiot sits in there doesn't surprise me. The fact that a text if admin would take sides with a racist does surprise me.

Race has nothing to do with MGTOW. However on racist Reddit subredfits this is not only permissible. It is supported and it is promoted. I will not be going back into that subreddit even as a lurker. It has become a hive of scum and villainy."
220,TimJohnsonIII,Got banned. No explanation. No reply when I questioned.
221,,"Yes. I did. I've also been banned from r/IncelTears and r/TrueFemcels. I was going to give r/feminism a shot, but I absolutely refuse to visit that sub under any circumstances. 

You either hate the targeted gender of those subs or get out. Reason and neutrality are not welcome. 

Honestly, I'm convinced incels have taken over r/MGTOW. They're just so hateful and miserable over there. It's depressing. Do you know not one of those men have posted anything to honor Father's Day? They're so busy hating women they forgot to show all the dads out there love today.

HAPPY FATHER'S DAY TO ALL OF THE GOOD FATHERS OUT THERE!

""True love exists, but it's super rare in our generation.

I know these older couple, pretty well off and retired at about 50? The dude fell sick and was hospitalized, they had the option to discontinue treatment as it seemed hopeless (and was expensive as hell). I would've pulled the plug tbh but the lady did everything she could to treat him; risking their retirement plans.

Thankfully, he didn't have to go through the full course of expensive treatments and they're now enjoy their golden years.

I found out that they were each other's firsts and both worked hard together to earn their wealth. Guy's not a chad too.""
  
Some guy responded with ""Go. Away.""
  
""Not sure why you're so hostile. If you disagree with me, we can have a proper discussion.

Think of it this way.

Getting a unicorn is like winning a lottery. It's so rare that you might as well treat it as non-existent.

But are there lottery winners? Yes.

Should I spend a lot of resources in trying to win the lottery? No.

But the fact remains that there are lottery winners.""

Well, i guess that's just another dialectic. My life prior to MGTOW was antithesis and MGTOW was thesis. Now it's time for synthesis."
236,TigPlaze,A friend from MGTOW PMed me about having just gotten banned.  They gave him no reason why.  I made a post asking how someone can contest a ban in the event of a mistake.  My post vanished immediately.  This makes me think they have no interest in running MGTOW with integrity.  I invited him here to MGTOW2.
237,Implausible-asset,"Yes I got banned from r/mgtow for ""concern trolling"" on my old account. Nearly all the karma I had was from upvotes in that sub, but they banned me anyways. 

Yeah sorry no sorry, but when someone is complaining about not getting laid and is saying they're going to buy a gun and let fate decide, then yeah I'd say concern is warranted. 

I'm hopeful that here I can see the good posts on how mgtow helps men be better at being themselves, keeps them out of the trap of the marriage contract, and provides cautionary tales based on our own learning experiences with women. 

And mods for inevitable showing of the incels here, please hand out the bans like candy. Those fools are subreddit cancer."
238,Tsukikoselenia,"Been banned because.. I have absolutely no idea, honestly. Not even incel-bashing, defending women, or anything like that (it really isn't my type), just a sudden ban out of nowhere, maybe because of a talk with a guy about how improvement is important but saying that hard work will always work is false, since this guy's posts got deleted?

Shows you everything you need to know about them. Those aren't true MGTOW and if they are that cowardly on the internet, you have to wonder how bad they are in real life. That's also why that subreddit attracts the lowest quality posters, who mostly seem to want to brag that they have money and women chase them now, which is ridiculous. If you want to attract women that's the opposite of MGTOW."

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad others are seeing this trend and speaking up as well. I first subscribed to MGTOW because there were good articles about self improvement and building better habits. The trend seems more and more externally focused and less and less about self improvement.

Repressing others (individuals or groups) does not free my mind, it traps it in a negative feedback loop of anger, fear and resentment. All of which I want to let go of and put down.‚Äù"

And one of responses there was ""vaginas stink anywhere, I don't need your disgusting hole"" or something, so I responded ""is this sub just riddled with incels?""

The moderators are not replying to my reply to their 'ban message' (although they said ""reply to this message to get an explanation for your ban"") ... so, it appears the mods on r/MGTOW are not doing their job in a timely fashion, or they are corrupt.

Now almost all of that helpful knowledge and sound advice is being clouded by articles and rants that reflect misogyny, and at times, pure black pilled hatred.

My comment:

[Just out of curiosity, can‚Äôt this be applied to males as well? A lot of my mates are pretty promiscuous dudes and have had plenty of one night stands. So with this logic, are they no different from the women this excerpt aims to shame? 

Not trying to ruffle feathers, just kinda curious on the stance about men that do the things MGTOW hate about women (cheating, sleeping around, using another person for any kind of temporary/ personal gain, etc.). I try not to keep dudes like that in my friend circle anymore,  I can certainly say I‚Äôve seen a lot of men do these things that women are so demonized for.  I‚Äôve certainly been fucked over by the opposite sex, but a lot of my mates have done the same to some genuinely nice women. 

As a single male, I wonder about the MGTOW movement and if it is too extreme of an ideology for me. Don‚Äôt mind the GMOW part, since that is the life I tend to lean towards as an introvert, but I love my mother, and sisters, and have met genuinely kind women.]


Hopefully some of you in this sub can answer this without me being banned first. I‚Äôm looking for camaraderie with people who aren‚Äôt so relationship focused and driven by the need for someone else in their life to make them happy, but MGTOW might be too extreme or me."

333,Memekip,"Yep 

I'm all for male independence, but I feel that constantly going around in a circlejerk of hating women just proves that the people who hang out there are clearly not over it. Being one sided and keeping an eye out for only bad women which fit the narritive in your head is just asking to get into a toxic mindset imo: vicareously playing the victim of a minority of women who play the victim to take advantage of men

Well idk, either because I‚Äôm a chick or because I genuinely was trying to understand their logic- or both.. probably both.

I‚Äôm all for men feeling empowered without women.. but I found myself at mgtow because just like with ‚Äúman haters‚Äù, neither gender should be held accountable for the world‚Äôs problems, or an individual‚Äôs problems.. and I was wondering what kind of logic they use since it does seem they blame women for all the world‚Äôs problems. 

I‚Äôd argue a lot of women‚Äôs problems are culturally pushed on women by other women, and same with men. 

And also, I have more male friends than female friends... like the two genders aren‚Äôt strictly romance based... but mgtow makes it out to be just a biological reproductive thing between the genders.. platonic relationships are important."

We need to truly look at what we NEED in life not what we want. Because right now basic needs are not being met by 60% of the population.

371,In_This_Here_Economy,"MGTOW went to shit for the exact same reason feminism did: the reactionary, fringe elements have become the leading voices of the movement.  I don't share the beef with feminism that a lot of MGTOW men believe that they have to have.  I know and understand that feminism, at it's core, is just as much about dismantling gender roles for men as it is women.  If I am to be honest, it was actual feminism that taught me self respect as a man and why I was compelled to a lot of the behaviors and concepts of myself, women and the world that I had, and that reason is patriarchy.  The same men who brag about how it's been primarily men who've created civilizations and governments are the same ones who deny the existence of patriarchy unironically and under the spell of cognitive dissonance.

It's ridiculous, actually.  

The most important thing, I think, for a man to remember is that he doesn't have to hate women to recognize and respect himself as a human being, and he doesn't have to hate himself to recognize and respect the humanity of women."
372,throwawayapparently9,"the real problem is not the act of ""getting banned."" 
you could always use throwaway accounts to get back there and I'm fine with it.
but the real probelm is that you ""can NOT contact them""! 
it doesn't matter how hard you try or if ""one of the old guys"" you were there, they will never respond you back, NEVER. 
I've been banned from dozens of subreddits, especially LGBTs, feminists, cuckoldery fetishists, adulteries, affair advices, cheating experiences, and I'm cool with getting banned from there, because they are my ""enemy"" territory, getting banned from there is EXPECTED. 
but when i got banned from mgtow? hell no, i wasn't expecting that. i was a men's right activist and a mgtow commentator at the time, and i always considered manosphere my FRIENDLY territory (except PUA and Incels, we don't share much in common) but i never expected a BAN from mgtow. 
the problem is, they won't tell you WHY they banned you and they'll never give you a SECOND chance ever again.
so if the moderators don't want to give a fuck about banned members, why should banned members give a fuck about them? 
and again, they're NOT the OFFICIAL mgtow, as they have confessed it themselves in subreddit. 

but after that, i can't trust any FRIENDLY territory anymore. 

I'm always expecting getting banned from MRA and MGTOW_2 now and i could never trust any territories anymore but i expect a little decency from moderators to respect me and tell me why i got banned and how i can get unbanned."

391,-Entilzha_Valen-,"Well...got banned from there...again.  Not sure if it was for recommending this sub to someone who sounded more reasonable than most of the ‚Äòtard‚Äôs there...

Or if it was for telling people to read the article in a linked post and not the narrative driven synopsis that someone made.

Basically the synopsis said the woman got away with the crime, she was released no charges.  But the article said she was re arrested, charged with multiple crimes, and was undergoing a psych evaluation.

Proof positive that the narrative is the most important thing there and not any form of truth.  Sounds like /r/politics."

I'm not sure that it's all that unpopular around here.  However I think that encouraging it is [a mistake](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/unique-everybody-else/201303/internet-ranting-and-the-myth-catharsis).  I'm not saying that people who are angry shouldn't be encouraged to discuss their anger and its underlying causes.  I am saying that the constant focus on negativity over on that sub is counterproductive and only helps hold people in that state and keeps them from moving on to better things."
393,cooler_water,"Yes, but the majority of MGTOW1 posts/comments were all about misogyny, and anyone that thought otherwise was shunned by the masses. That isn't healthy "
394,FlourishedCass,"I've been browsing again for the past few months and I've realised that I haven't really missed much. Just the same old memes as the past 3 years but with more inciting violence and incel garbage. Granted there are a few good posters there with thoughtful shit, like Dang, but they all just get drowned out or downvoted.

&#x200B;

I also got a lot of shit for responding to a woman and actually talking to her like a human being; it's absolutely pathetic how the sub has devolved into men vs women."
395,Mindraker,"This (MGTOW2) sounds more like a Gentleman's club than a hate group, which MGTOW1 was turning into."
396,ATLpunk86,"Speaking of memes, MGTOW1 tends to suffer from what I like to call - not knowing the rules of the internet.

Sure, we all know about rule 34. But what about 33? That's the one about lurking more.

Seems to me there's a bit too much spouting off at the mouth over there and not enough choosing words wisely."

408,purge1,"Sleeping is obviously a femoid kind of thing, LOL."
409,William_A_Bishop,"Me too. The only thing I'd posted that was remotely controversial recently was that i thought women were people and i tried to treat them like i do men. 

I pissed of some dude, so he probably reported me. After the moderation change, i think that someone is trying to turn ""mgtow"" into ""incel"" in the minds of the average person.

Edit: honestly, i should probably thank them. The place was slowly turning me back to constantly thinking about women.. "
410,Membrudo,So now it is mgtow2 where the real men hang...
411,discord_doodle,wow...I swear reddit is a shit site to be on but the sign up process is too easy
412,Implausible-asset,"I can tell you why I avoid women 24/7. Speaking only for myself:

1. Marriage is a raw deal for men. Everyone knows this. I dont want to subject myself to that kind of slavery.

2. Dating and girlfriends: Every girlfriend I've had has either cheated on me with someone who had more money or a better position in life. Monkey branching. I dont fault them for it now, it's just their nature. And I dont enjoy the feeling of a breakup when I was thinking everything was ok. Casual dating equates to more buying free dinners than romantic reward, and it's expensive I'd rather use those resources on my self. Also the breakup psycho factor. Consensual sex and turn into a rape claim that without any investigation at all can ruin your life. No thank you 

3. Women in the workplace: I am 100% professional all the time, and make sure I'm never alone with one. A false claim to HR about touching her butt or her being offended by a joke  can have you out on your ass faster than 5pm comes on a holiday weekend. It's not worth the risk.

4. Day to day life: they only talk to you if they want something from you. And I dont want to give them anything. I want to do what I want to do. 

Staying away from women keeps me focused, energized, and moving forward. It's the way I mgtow, and mgtow is freedom. "
413,thalobby,They're probably afraid of getting #metoo'd
414,NathanHollister,"Un, that's the point of MGTOW. No women= no chance of having your money stolen, no chance of getting metood, no chance of returning to the plantation"

416,Yasai101,I agree
417,xpillx,"Ohhh I think I know why I got banned from reading mgtow vs mgtow2 topic. There was a thread some mgtow made and he posted a sexbot and said he would rather fuck that than a real woman. I was instantly wronged about it. I said something like:
""I dunno man... stuff like that creeps me out. Id rather fuck my hand watching porn or fuck a real woman (escort or maybe relationship but no marriage).""

I think thats healthy mindset and my preferance. Seems like those sweaty losers got triggered and banned me lmao."

Conversely, having kids just makes one more future feminist. Because odds are good you lose the kid to a feminist wench, or the public school indoctrinates your kid, or college indoctrinates him. Kids are fine, as long as you adopt and homeschool him. Otherwise, he's probably fucked no matter how redpill you are"

What a toxic shitshow of a sub. I just replied to the bastard and reported his comments. There are too many assholes who hide behind their devices and talk shit on the sub.

MGTOW2 is very humble and less interested in bashing women. I am open to discuss female nature, tactics, AWALT, but I don't hate them for being what they are. Its about us, not them.

Oh, crap. I just had a hilarious, yet horrific, and likely inaccurate, thought.

Honestly, a lot of the things posted there would cause those men to get fired if their employers saw it. That would explain why they ban people who make sense.

Over the time period I was at MGTOW1  I could see the mods becoming less tolerant and more willing to use the ban hammer.     Was this because of the fast growth of the subreddit, now over 100K?

They all aspire to be narcissistic self-serving all because of female experience. But how is that any different than a woman? 

MGTOW is married to the idea that you'll be happier without solipsistic women in it. But you become self-serving solipsistic yourself. You also become utterly miserable without fulfilling your biological imperative. It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons. 

Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men. So what's the difference? Because all I see is men like this too. Especially MGTOW men who aren't interested in building community. I spent a year trying to build a community around MGTOW with users and they were never interested. All they want to do is moan about women all day. 

MGTOW doesn't make you happy. Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving. Society as an whole has become too big. Where as men and women would thrive in smaller communities. There are too many issues just to blame it all on women. And as society increases so does its lack of empathy and the feeling you are just a number. So better to build small communities. But no one wants to do that. But eventually society will get that bad, they wont have a choice. "

623,_n1codemus,"It is not true. Man and woman operate on different levels of consciousness. We men are usually pretty straightforward. You know the meme, 

I am simple man I see boobs and I press like.

It is more than just a joke. That is why naturally men are more attracted/capable of doing in e.g STEM. It is our culture to which highly honors these values as important. I do not agree with that and feminism is actually damaging woman on the long road. Just as men are *better* in natural fields, woman have insticts and operate on levels unimaginable for men. Man can be Simping for years and could not see it but woman will notice the shit much more quickly. You can lie a woman for a year but to a man awhole life. They have *antennas* or special instincts (mother instincts) that cannot be accessed by pure logic and intellect.

Long story short, until human being destructure its imagined complexity back to the basics. Hunting and protecting for man, nurturing care and submission for woman. We are together doomed. In this dooming it is best to go your own way until things restart themselves."

645,,">The idea of MGTOW isn't about building a community. 

The fact that it's a community based subreddit that states to its members that it's nothing to do with community goes to show you that it is utterly self-serving. How is that any different than any woman or man you meet today in society?

MGTOW just plays into the narcissistic division segregationist society. It literally says, ""Okay society, you win! Now let me get my fill"" and instead becomes exactly what nihilist society wants in a MGTOW's own image. 

How did I draw that conclusion? That chase of career. The chase for material. Elliot Hulse said it better that ""I'm with you MGTOW but you focus too much on the matter. The mother world. The material.""

And I believe he is right to some extent. There's no harm in bettering your career but if that's all you do and all you aspire it material, what is your legacy? 

>Being self-serving doesn't mean I'm harming anyone else in the process

Not at all but its essentially why societies collapse. It's a communist-like mindset. And as the population grows into self-serving narcissism so does the utter disdain and divide amongst people. 

>MGTOW has made me happier than I've ever been, so I don't know what you mean by that. 

It's all about how it makes you feel. Which is the issue with this society. It's always self-entitled. Self-centered thinking about its own self. It doesn't want to better the lives of those around them. It is one degree away from feminism.

>Learning to not depend on anyone but myself for happiness is the biggest step I've taken in my entire life. The fact that there are shitty people from both genders has nothing to do with why MGTOW is still relevant.

MGTOW is relevant in a nihilist society. I've come to the conclusion its a way of coping and becoming just like modern women. Which only serves to divide and segregate everyone. 

But you never see MGTOWs want to get together and build a community. All you get is, ""MGTOW is about your own path"" And being surrounded by self-serving entitled men just reminds me of a male version of feminism. 

What beyond the basics of don't get married and be careful does MGTOW provide? There's no pearls of wisdom beyond a few YouTubers. Majority of golden posts are from The Red Pill and books that don't follow the self-serving approach.

And MGTOW can't even do what they set out to do anyway. They focus too much on negative female experience. They talk about women all day on MGTOW1 and how much monsters they are. They give women their power away by making them the boogeyman/woman.

Atleast The Red Pill aspires for community. Atleast it brings men into its fold and looks after them within their small community. MGTOW does nothing but worship the self. And that's how we got here in the first place.

So you can say MGTOW has helped you. Perhaps it has. But I didn't come here to serve myself. I came here for brotherhood because without it any community inevitably collapses. Just like the PUA community did.  Stronger together, divided we fall. And it will always be this way. A community without guidance is going nowhere. 
"
646,Impossible-asset,"One thing that is an important consideration when you are talking about the principle of ""AWALT"" (all women are like that). It is pointless to bring up ""NAWALT"" (not all women are like that), because unless someone is genuinely disturbed in the head, they will know that out of the 4 billion women on the earth, it is not even statistically possible that every single one will be an ""awalt"" type. 

The whole reason that AWALT is even a saying is because there is enough of a risk in dating, relationships, and marriage today that AWALT is a reminder of a real danger you face as a man. 

If I were given a 50 gallon drum of apples, and only 10 of them were poisonous, but the only way to tell the poisonous ones from the good ones is after I take a bite, I wouldn't be worried about what my odds are of ""finding a good apple"". I'd slap a big warning label ""DANGER: POISONOUS APPLES, DO NOT EAT"" on the side, and leave the whole thing out by the dumpster for trash pickup. 

That's what AWALT is. It's a warning that engaging in an activity has many detriments, and few benefits. It's not a scientific statement. 

Many guys get stuck in being angry after being on the receiving end of a ""poisonous apple"" when it comes to women. And so they choose to walk away from that in the future. Some stay angry, which is what I am hoping to help get them out of by having a sub like this where they can talk with other mgtow men about how they can move on successfully. The other mgtow sub is for staying stuck in the anger side of things. 

What women do mgtow men want? well, depends. When it comes to marriage and cohabitation, the answer is none. For myself, I extend that to girlfriends, dating, and any non-professional relationship. Though some mgtow men are open to that."
647,Deadpanpancakes,"Its not so much that there are a few ""good women"". I think looking at people through the lens of good and bad are too simplistic. People as a general rule are selfish and self serving. Obviously it is to a degree that doesnt jeopardize other things they want. Also, people tend to delude themselves into thinking that they arent ""wrong or bad"" when they want to justify doing something that is pretty abhorrent. Im more concerned about the society around us that holds women to many double standards or the fact that theres sometimes no recourse for a man and nobody seems to give a shit.  You take the shaky moral relativistic nature of women and their selfish attitude and combine it with the male hating legal system and you get men opting out because it is the reasonable thing to do."

649,DJDickJob,"There's nothing wrong with building a community, it's just not the central focus of MGTOW.

I'm opposed to the idea that you have to ""hit the gym bro"" or make a lot of money, I don't live by those types of principles. I mean, if that's what you want to do, then go for it, but material things like that have nothing to do with the point of MGTOW. "

>MGTOW is married to the idea

This is psychological word play.

>You also become utterly miserable without fulfilling your biological imperative.

This is an out right lie. Having a woman does not make a man happy. If you are a miserable man when you have a woman you will just be a miserable man with pussy.

>It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons.

It does matter that not all women are evil as you say. There are plenty of evil women to go around and all it takes is one to destroy a man's life.

>Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men

This is the men and women are equal lie. Why? Because lets say you have 2 children, the one every time he does something wrong you punish and the other child you allow to do what ever he wants. Who do you think is going to be well behaved the child that was getting punished every time he did something wrong or the child that you did not punish when he did something wrong? It's obvious that it's going to be the child that was getting punished when he did something wrong. In our case men are being punished and women are being allow to go unpunished or get a slap on the wrist. Just look at
all the women that have falsely accused men of rape for example. When was the last time you heard of a man falsely accusing a woman of rape? There is no way men and women are going to act the same when women have the state backing them and men just have
themselves backing them. Also men and women are different so they are not going act the same. Men were the protectors and providers because men think others. Just look what happens when there is a catastrophe. It's men that jump into rescue others at a risk to their own lives.

>All they want to do is moan about women all day.

What this guy is effectively saying is if you're going way why do you talk about women so much. The reason men need to talk about female nature is because we are trying to help other young men not to fall into the traps women and society are trying to get young men to fall into.

>Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving.

Obviously men are going to start becoming self-serving. What did you expect men to be generous when women are so selfish? So men should just continue to give and give and give while women continue to abuse men?

>Society as an whole has become too big

So this guy is into eugenics.

>There are too many issues just to blame it all on women

MGTOWS don't blame all issues on women. We know simps are also part of the problem too.

My mom used to do it to me. She'd give me points for doing good things like getting good grades, helping her around the house, helping dad with his office work etc.

And then I could use these to buy myself things, like a new toy helicopter, or a bike or a game boy or something.

But the difference is, I was fucking 5 years old and this is a grown ass man, who I presume makes his own money. 

It made sense when my mom did it to 5 year old me, and I'm thankful she did that, she and dad taught me about managing responsibility and the value of hard work among other things.

I'm 19 now and my mom and dad don't do it anymore, since they know that the system has outlived its usefulness

But this is a grown adult, and even I can recognise that theres something really wrong about this whole issue"
747,DonMelbourne,"\^This. I remember someone making a similar point, with the following example:

If a man said to his friends ""I'd like to go, but I better not, my wife wouldn't like it!"", his friends would probably laugh, and understand.

If a woman said to her friends ""I'd like to go, but I better not, my husband wouldn't like it!"", her friends would be concerned and ask ""Is everything okay at home? Are you being bullied?"""

With America's steady rise in popularity in terms of entertainment and politics over the decades, people all over the world have been increasingly made more ""western"", which translates into taking in all the bad points of being an american.

Even in countries like mine which couldn't be further from US, both geographically, and socially, you can see the cancer of western feminism creeping in and breaking society from the inside.

It's difficult to think where feminism is going right now, but for me, feminism as a movement became redundant by the year 2000. Hey, atleast you don't have to worry about fake allegations right?"

793,,"The problem is that the extreme majority of women who are anti-feminists still want all the power and privileges feminism has brought them.  They are against feminism for victimizing men (and for being crazy), but just as strongly against removing things that give them advantages and power.  Such as legal preference in child custody and alimony and the stupidly easy divorce laws, etc.  And when I say ""legal preference"" I mean that the woman is by default the legal provider to the child and so there are actually men out there who pay their ex-wife child support even though the men in question have custody of the child.

Basically, most women who are anti-feminism are pro-girl power.  Which is feminism just without being openly anti-male.  Feminism = anti-male to get power, girl power = pro female to get power.  The power and privileges and dominance they want is the same, they just try to get it by being nice instead of by being hostile."

One of them is a libertarian voting white man, while the other is a Republican voting latino man. One of the my other trans friends is openly pro-Trump, who she sees as the only person who's crazy enough to stand up to the ""liberal"" left (her words, not mine).

On the larger screen there are groups like Gays for Trump who are definitely not aligned with #metoo folks.

As all of you know, there's a personal and professional cost to not being on board with these liberal movements. Especially if you're living in a large, ""liberal"" city, it can be very isolating for LGBT people to be vocal about their beliefs about these catchy-named movements which lack any substance. Not making any justifications though

I shared here because I wanted to get it off my chest and fwiw, this seemed like the only place a post like this would be tolerated (even with a throwaway account). Do you think I was treated more positively because I was a woman? If yes, how could I have stopped that?"
799,,"Skepticism is very healthy, especially of things online.

I mentioned elsewhere that I do believe I got and still get special treatment. I despise that, but most of the time it's out of my hands. Those who know me will vouch for the fact that I don't seek it out.

I do think I can be metooed falsely. False allegations of this kind are usually made by people who are mentally unbalanced, and there is no scarcity of psychological issues in the lesbian community. I've had one very close encounter with something like that. I'd share it, but I feel I've shared too much identifying information already, and I don't want to get doxxed.

I'd probably get 50/50 custody ... unless my ex could spin my lack of support for feminism into something evil. I don't know, and I don't want to find out.

Our experiences are definitely different. But that doesn't mean that I can't see absolute abuse of the social and judicial systems at the hands of these women. I have seen more things than I've written here. It's not just about me receiving shit at the hands of women."

801,,"I have to make sure that I'm not being put in leadership positions just because I'm a woman. I've actually been offered to lead teams in areas I'm not comfortable in, and it's a bit of a pickle trying to figure out how to weasel myself out of it without ruffling feathers or causing drama. If I say that I don't think I'm capable enough for the role, people seem to want to ""encourage"" me (because women need encouragement?) 

Luckily, the team I'm with right now, I'm fully certain that I'm a right fit for them, and they for me (at least till six months ago, when they hired the other two women). I know I'd be miserable if I were in a position I wasn't qualified or capable of being in, and I'd fight that tooth and nail. I take pride in my work, and I derive a lot of my self esteem from doing a good job at whatever I do -- I'd hate it to be taken away from me.

This is precisely why I'm against how programs advocating more diversity in tech fields are structured. It just makes everyone miserable.

Having said that, I'm sure I have received opportunities because I was a woman. The prominent one that comes to mind is that I funded my graduate studies partially off a women-only scholarship. I'm not sure how I feel about that. On one hand, I feel that if someone wants to pay money to a certain group of people, they should be allowed to do that. On the other hand, it sucked very bad to see my male peers go through financial difficulties I didn't have to go through, for the most part (though all of us, men and women, were broke, to various degrees, in grad school)"

A nitpick with how you phrased this: I think most women have no idea that MGTOW exists. 

Women and **men** discount MGTOW when they initially hear about it because it goes against the current narrative: men should get married, or at least pursue women, so that they can be happy(!) 

I think the kick-back against MGTOW is through a genuine desire to help men achieve happiness(!) by getting married. 'Won't you be lonely', etc. Painting it as though women hate MGTOW because it teaches men to put himself first is too broad a brush. Certainly some women might see it that way, but for the majority of women who hear about MGTOW: their criticisms of MGTOW are similar to men's criticisms."

That wasn't long ago. And for the most part, it's business as usual in this feminist society, but the cracks are present. 

What I predict will happen is either society will self correct completely, making gender distinction once again fashionable and even marketable. A push back mechanism against this gender neutrality. This could make this whole gender war just a cringe phase in our history. There's still room for ""Something in between"" in this. 

Another possibility is the eventual elimination of traditional roles or behavior models attached to sex. This is the ultimate end game of this feminist agenda. 

Either is a solid possibility. Humans are a highly programmable species. Our sense of morality and normality changes over time, and if things continue as they are now, it's inevitable."

Ultimately our logic and reason tends to crumble when tingles take over and drive us to be able to have some thrill.  This applies to both sexes, though women as the emotionally driven sex are definitely more apt towards this behavior.  Also many people knowingly behave in a hypocritical manner as a way to advance socially. Not everyone has morals and behaves in an ethical manner. Think middle management types and office personnel.

They'll have a bad breakup then bitch about women online, using MGTOW as an excuse to do, and then drop the whole act when a girl they like comes into the picture. I call them repeat offenders. They're only ever here when there's no women interested in them.

&#x200B;

So many men these days are over-feminized, flaky little rats. They won't stand up for shit, won't stay true to their words, and will abandon all their own morals in an instant to get what they want. That's behaviour I'd expect from a woman, or a 12 year old. Not a grown-ass, 'supposedly independent man."

-
Ayup... I have noted that many, **many** times within my comments in /r/MGTOW.
-
Even came up with a term for them: they're not so much MGTOW as they are the **""Ex""-**Men -- as in **""Ex""**-husbands (the ones who were married & got divorce-raped) and **""Ex""**-boyfriends (the ones who were just cohabiting or in some other ""LTR"" short of the official-legal paperwork) -- and generally speaking they're just going through their *""I'm DONE with women! [And THIS time I really mean it!!]""* phase.

-
I've also noted that -- per both statistics on divorced guys, and my anecdotal observations of men in general -- THAT stage typically lasts anywhere from a month to about a year or so (maybe a bit longer if it was a ""brutal"" breakup or devastating divorce-rape) -- before they start ""testing the waters"" (flirting, eyeing up women to at least potentially ""date"" or ""hookup"" with, logging onto {or back onto} Tinder, etc)...

-
And then, in about 2/3 of the cases, within 5 years they're ""remarried"" again (in scare quotes because they MIGHT just ""cohabit"" instead, avoiding the official-legal paperwork, as if that will save their arse)... with **most** of the remaining 1/3 just taking a bit longer (possibly having one or more ""aborted midstream"" attempts at relationships that fell short of an actual LTR/cohabit/marriage).

-
Overall, I'd bet that LESS than 1/10 (~10%) of them **actually** manage to live the rest of their lives as *true* ""MGTOW"" -- they're just TOO habituated to either the sex and/or the ""in a relationship"" identity, etc -- and too ILL-equipped to actually ""go it alone."""
854,EmptyRedCloud,">even my dad who knows nothing about MGTOW

He may not know the term, but he's apparently ""getting the message"" regardless."
856,Frelsi_8899,"I view most women this way. 

Here's an experiment. 

Try to have female friends where the quality of the friendship is on par with your guy friends. Suspend any sexual desires, and just try to have a friendship. 

It's when you start holding women accountable to the same standard as men. When your expectations of their behavior are the same as men, that's when you'll start seeing the core problems. 

Most of them are psychotic. Most can barely keep an actual conversation. Most cannot escape their nature and cannot fathom you in any other context outside that of utility. Regardless of your best efforts to befriend a female with any hope of forming a normal friendship. Disappointingly you'll end up just being that nice shoulder to cry on. 

You'll quickly fall into the stereotypical bullshit where you sit around listening to her relationship woes. Until she's vented enough, has a paradigm shift and now has no need for the dynamic of the relationship she pushed. So she will drop you. 

Sorry to say this, but we only ended up in this shitstorm thanks to feminism. In our school days, we had it right. Most of us weren't friends with girls. We had a saying ""Chicks are for banging"". 

I'm 42 now, and yeah I even have a few female friends. They're all ""normal"" by female standards, but when you get closer they're flakey, self-absorbed and frankly a bit insane."

And then the irony of it is that the ""new"" one they eventually pick -- choose or fall for or end up with depending on how you look at it/label it -- is often (and we're talking *blatantly/obviously*) ***cut from the same EXACT cloth*** as the one they just divorced/got divorce-raped by/were alternating between crying & raging & grieving over just a year or so prior when they were in their reactionary (faux-MGTOW) ""I'm DUN with women!"" stage/phase.

-
We're talking almost IDENTICAL... as in even down to their NAMES\*...
-
So they divorce and/or get divorced by *Louisa* (that bitch, can you believe she cheated with the NEIGHBOR, expected to be forgiven and for hubby to still be NICE to that neighbor?)... but then FF a couple of years and who do they hookup with and marry but a 2x divorcee (with kids and thus one or more of her ""ex/baby-daddy"" guys nearby), and she is named... wait-for-it... *Luisa!*  

-
WTF? That's like trading off an old used Chevy because, well *""it got dented up in an accident""* and you just CAN'T STAND the idea of driving a dented up car (etc) -- but then going out and buying **another** old used Chevy, except one that's even MORE dented up because it's been in *multiple* accidents (and from the looks of it possibly even driven in a ""demolition derby"").

-
Moreover, while there usually ARE some -- relatively superficial -- differences (i.e. the first wife was a blonde, the second a brunette, etc) when it comes to voice & speaking pattern, inflections/accent, even general overall behavior & ""character"" of the person... DESPITE the insistence of the guy that ""this one is DIFFERENT from the other one""; the resemblance is sort of ""uncanny""

-
A half dozen guys that I know PERSONALLY (as in been friends either with them or with their families for decades) have followed that EXACT same pattern\*\*... it's to the point that I figure one can PREDICT (with something like at least, *if not better than,* 50% accuracy) both when and who (name/character) they WILL ""partner up with"" again in fairly short order.

-
**But to get back to YOUR point...**
-
Yes I'd say you're correct in that it is somewhere *around* if not ***more than half*** of the guys on various MGTOW forums (/r/MGTOW and /r/MGTOW2 especially) who follow that pattern.

---

And then, as you said at the end of your prior comment:

>>On the other had you have guys like me that aren't mad, we just don't give a sh!t.

EXACTLY.
-
Unfortunately... because MGTOW forums are virtually the LAST ""male space"" that allows such bitching *(sort of the same as why the guy being cheated on/divorced ends up calling his [never-married] BACHELOR buddy at 2AM*\*\*\**)* -- we end up getting painted with the brush of THEIR ""blue pill raging."" (And while **WE** calmly, coldly, objectively {and yes often a bit harshly/brutally} talk about the REALITY of female nature {and MALE nature as well, though that is often overlooked/forgotten}; **THEY** {recently or 'in the midst of' divorce/d guys) come in, repeat & exaggerate the points about WIMMIN... in an angry ""red pill"" RAGING-story fashion, bitch about their wives/gf's {especially the ""cheating"" etc}... and so the accusations of ""misogyny"" {which then have some validity}.)

-
Just like the ""incels"" -- the not only NEVER been married, NEVER ""fucked""; but *most often NEVER dated, kissed, or been even the least bit 'intimate' with a female in real life* -- who plop in, MISunderstand what MGTOW is about (often only imbibing and regurgitating the superficial ""meme-pic"" garbage), and thus contribute to the mischaracterization of the whole enterprise.

-
**The TEMPTATION** is to BLAME them... but of course the fault really lies with US (the true/actual/real ""MGTOW"" -- that is time-tested/proven as such); in that **we take PITY on these ""pathetic"" creatures** and let them into our ""clubhouse.""

-

---
\* Which I often have to wonder whether it isn't ""on purpose"" as a sort of safety/insurance -- I mean so long as the name SOUNDS the same, then if in some moment of passion (or memory error) they say their EX's name, well no one will be the wiser -- but regardless, it's rather WEIRD/TELLING that the guy who WAS married to ""Louisa"" ends up marrying a ""Luisa""; or likewise with other name-combos; the guy who divorced ""Cathy"" then marries a ""Katherine"" [Kathy], or yet again from Sarah to Sara, Susan/Suzzane[Susie/Suzie], Mari/Mary & even Marianne/Mary-Anne, Ginny/Jennifer[Jenny], Kristina/Christiana [Kris/Chris & even Krissy/Chrissie etc] and so on...

-
\*\* And there are other elements too: basically the DEPTH/HEIGHT of the ""RAGE"" and/or depression/crying that ensues... is a predictor, **not** of them *truly* becoming or following MGTOW, but rather the opposite; the MORE they rage (or cry, complain, etc -- same thing really) the MORE likely they are to ""return to the plantation"" for round #2 (and #3, etc).

-
\*\*\* Mainly because -- well not only do WE actually ""understand"" the situation (we've seen/heard it dozens if not hundreds of times before) -- but we're the only ones that will (or even practically CAN) actually TAKE their calls... especially at that hour of the day/night.  They DARE not call their other ""married"" buddies (assuming they even have such), lest they create further problems."
872,EnigmaticRonin,"Yup, you can see this with Jordan Peterson, and I'm not even a fan of him, but just watch how his logical points are completely disregarded.

Over the last year I definitely see tiredness and bleakness wash over him. To me this reinforced my idea of ""shut up and do."" The time for talking is over. You want to help men? Mentor them, guide them, help them network and get jobs. No need to talk to anyone, that is what females do...sit around and gossip to get another being to do the heavy lifting. Men just DO...period but this is getting lost."

Moreover, the following:

>>Usually, at least from my own personal observations, the single mothers who are getting praised aren't getting praised for intentionally raising their children alone, but for doing the best they can to raise them alone because the man bounced and is not being a father.

That ""Usually"" there at the beginning tells me you have an inherent **prejudice** in this regard... one that you are NOT being honest about."
876,Frelsi_8899,"The enabling aspect in all of this is that many people alive today are just living off the technological advancements of others. They do not have the intelligence to actively participate in this. They have no real social obligations either. 

They walk around with a very limited understanding of things because they're so arrogant they assume anything outside of their sphere applies through their projective nature. 

They also have far too much time on their hands and get deeply caught up in first world problems. 

Now a subset of these due to their vindictive nature and misguided compasses are just in it to stir social unrest. Some even might believe they're doing good, but without the intelligence and foresight, they cannot fathom the deeper implications of their agendas and they have no empathy to begin with anyways. 

They're a product of ""Princess syndrome"". They believe they're special, better than everyone else and always correct.

877,,"I specifically said ""in my experience"" for that exact reason. You may have a valid argument if I implied this was a fact in all cases. However, I made it very clear that my statement was based upon pure anecdotal evidence. Why are you so determined to be combative over such a non-issue, anyway? In my observations, that, indeed, is usually the case. That's strictly *my* reality. If you've observed and/or personally experienced differently, that is strictly *your* reality. It doesn't make either of us entirely right or wrong, nor does it suggest that the scenario described in the OP is purely a fabrication that never happens. I was offering a different perspective on the point in the discussion which is based on a false premise; that all single mothers are proud to be single mothers and shamelessly flaunt such a status. 

There are multiple causes of single motherhood where praising said mothers for raising their children alone is appropriate. The example I listed  in my original post is common in my community. Right below that is the father being murdered. Right below that is the father being imprisoned. All of these examples were caused by either the fathers themselves or third parties. The single mothers who manage to raise their kids alone when faced with these situations deserve to be encouraged for it.

On the flip side, single fathers get special attention as well because they go against a negative stereotype that fathers turn deadbeat when they separate from the mothers of their children. They also receive well-deserved praise if they raise their children due to the mother being an addict, imprisoned, or dead. There are many variables to these situations, and frankly, I find it crass and myopic to paint all single mothers with a broad brush because of this."
878,EnigmaticRonin,"Yup, I concur completely and have arrived at the same conclusions after conscious deliberation. Good news is that I truly do believe now is an awesome time to be a man and to help sharpen the few who have decided to desire something better.

I understand that many MGTOW people have far right views.. but there are legitimate issues that men face today (as there are with women) that have discouraged them into relationships and so fourth. 

Personally, I see courts bias  (child custody/divorce), state laws bias, a need for mandatory paternity test at a child‚Äôs birth and cultural expectations that reduce men‚Äôs equalities in some areas.

915,NakedValhallaBoy,"A lot of them are acting like this won't change anything because they can still post there, but the truth is that this means people aren't going to stumble upon and find it the way they used to, and those who might find it are going to be turned away by the fact that its quarantined.

Couple this with the fact that the mods ban anyone who gets reported for any reason, and the sub is going to die, and the potential growth of the movement with it."

Hope any new people here get acquainted with the rules and culture real quick."
918,MuleFool42,"I think that in general, Reddit is too censorious of ideas. Our whole world now, seems to be based on right/wrong think and if you hold a minority view on something based on lived experiences that go against the accepted group think, then you get censored. 

That said, I don't feel sorry for r/MGTOW. They express too much hate for women and other groups. That is not what MGTOW should be about. It should be for every man because it is beneficial to their overall well-being and long term prospects and happiness. 

Hate is not required."

Amen to that!

I still suspect the news report of that guy who was planning a shooting was what actually got them quarantined.  I mean, Red-ditz is a corporation and corporations are always, **always** giving themselves heartburn over liability issues.  After the incel and alt-white invasions, though, I say ""no love lost.""

On one hand I feel that they took what they deserved, when they proceeded to censure and bann everyone for holding and sceptical view about how they were handling the movement. On the other hand I'm not very confortable with the way Reddit is going, it might be the first step to label whatever subreddit they want under ""hate speech"" for staying in the opposite side of the spectrum of some minorities conformed into pressure lobbies who wants to impose their views as the only accpetable in the name of social justice here on the internet."

70% of the hot page as I see is all about 'women/feminist being assholes' but it always appealed to me that being an asshole goes both ways. 

Seeing the bashing posts only seemed like some people spent too much time on the sub and not on ~manly~ self development. Not on ~going their own way~  No wonder it got quarantined if that's the case

I mean yea women could be hoes (experienced it first hand) but men could be playboy assholes too.  It's not *Men Going Their Own Way* if they keep talking about women."

Yes, even a 2% mortality rate is very bad, and yes, an R0 of 2 is enough to sustain transmission in a large population... but it is nowhere near what you would need for a bioweapon.  If it goes global, it will be like the modern era‚Äôs bad flu years at worst, not like the WW1 flu. Which is bad, but not the end of the world. All of the data suggest that it came from bats (like most of the Coronaviridae), via some other animal.

Same with insta perma bans.  Should be removed.  Ban for three days as first warning.  If the person then continues to break rules and a mod goes to ban them it will then open up more long term bans.  Only giving the option for perma bans after three lesser bans have been completed.  Anyone who is then perma ban could be checked by the higg tier reddit mods to make sure it is not simply mods drunk with power."

947,TigPlaze,"Plus, they used a straw man as an excuse.  They claimed some MGTOW member was planning terr0r attacks and that law enforcement tracked his web searches of dangerous topics.  They didn't quote a single post this person made on MGTOW.  So someone can click on the ""join"" button and then search for nefarious things in a search engine, and get a sub banned.  Notice they never explain exactly how a MGTOW moderator is supposed to police what a member searches with a search engine or why that's supposedly a reasonable expectation."
948,,"True, but the real reason it's quarantined is because many young men come across it while browsing reddit. There's a fear that if more men continue to leave the plantation, feminism is dead in the water. What an embarrassment that would turn out to be."
949,Trek13,Reich wing shit like this is part of what doomed MGTOW1
950,VAJattConfederate,Issue is this mate Reddit is a private web site that pays for it's own server space. They can ban and censor what they want. I myself am an ardent MGTOW and reject a lot of hate society places on us  men especially in family court. If you all want your own spaces go to separate websites and servers managed by MGTOW supporting reddit is useless.

966,thisisd0g,"It's called MGTOW2. The original mgtow was packed with incels. Which by itself isnt necessarily a bad thing as I can understand where incels are coming from - dealing with similar problems when I was younger. But it becomes an echo chamber which can produce some pretty malignant attitudes. 

MGTOW (at least to me) isnt about hating women. It's about being indifferent to them."
967,Pedang_Katana,How come it doesn't count? I rarely visit that site so I've no idea what's going on behind the scene.
968,fmanly,"Yeah, I had seen the same thing. It is just quarantined.  Here is the behavior I saw:

1.  The sub disappeared from my list of subscribed subs.
2.  The sub's content disappeared from my front page.

I then navigated to reddit.com/r/MGTOW directly, and got the quarantine warning.  Once I acknowledged it I was brought to the sub.

At that point the MGTOW sub STILL doesn't appear in my list of subscribed subs, but now the articles do show up in my front page feed alongside other subs.

Bottom line is that with quarantine they are trying to get people who aren't actively visiting the sub to forget that it exists, and taking subtle measures to try to decrease the popularity of the sub, without outright banning it.  I suspect they have statistical data that the measures they're taking lower traffic over the long term, otherwise they wouldn't be stopping at what they're doing.  

I believe it also makes it less likely to show up in search results.  The goal is probably so that when guys type in the search bar ""does anybody else think marriage isn't worth it?"" or something similarly general they don't get pointed at MGTOW subs.  If they haven't heard of MGTOW already the goal is that they don't hear about it.

I'm skeptical that this sort of thing will do much in the case of MGTOW.  The trends that are driving men to go their own way are so large that it is going to be almost impossible to stop this without making big changes in how society works.  Half the trends on twitter/etc are practically advertisements for MGTOW..."

987,rak__z,It's incredibly common for subs to limit discussions about current events to only one stickied post to prevent floods of low effort posts that are the same thing. They're literally providing you with a platform to discuss the event why are you even mad.
988,Impossible-asset,"Because the sheer volume of people talking about a certain issue in a new post every 2 minutes would quickly overwhelm the sub.

This is a place to put your money where your mouth is.

You making money? Getting healthy and staying fit? Out for a 3 week hike in the mountains with your dog? Travelling europe maybe? Or just enjoying a peaceful evening of quiet in a home you own (or even built?)?

This is guy is clearly rich but it seems his money is driving him mad. It is almost pavlovian as well as boring and annoying. He seems to be in denial that women want anything else in the world other than money. I can think of a lot of things they want that aren't about money (but probably require it- but hey thats how we are all enslaved if money didn't exist we would be murdering each other ). If you go on there and you don't know who I am talking about you will. Except oh you are banned!

Current numbers suggest about 85% mild illness, 15% serious illness (which is very high), and 2-4% mortality within Wuhan (overwhelmed medical system) with mortality 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower outside of Wuhan, where more ICU beds are available.

Good overall summaries for non-healthcare people

About 2% based on *known* cases. There are certainly many cases so mild that they do not come to the attention of health care. The vast majority of those severely affected and dying are elderly, ill, or otherwise immunocompromised. Last I heard, no one under 15 had died (unlike influenza, which kills many children every year). 

Now, how about you provide your sources for the conspiracy claim that it‚Äôs a bioweapon (note that I don‚Äôt take YouTube or shock jocks as ‚Äòsources,‚Äô and I‚Äôd prefer valid medical sources), and that everyone is going to die and civilization will fall?

Think about the torrent wars 20 years ago.  Imagine instead of shutting down napster/etc the RIAA managed to find a way to throttle it so that downloads worked, but were painfully slow.  If they found the right balance then a lot of people would have stuck with it due to the effort required to create something new, and then the painful experience would have helped reduce the number of people pirating content.  Instead they used a sledgehammer and shut everything down, and thus there was a huge void and somebody created a new technology to fill the void. Then because there was no competition, everybody rapidly adopted the new technology.  If there was instead competition between the legacy technology that had a painful experience but an extensive library of content, and a new technology that was better which nobody actually used yet, then that would have fragmented the community and slowed adoption.

I think that is the goal here.  Don't scatter the roaches.  Instead get them to huddle up while the oxygen is slowly removed from the compartment.  Plus you get less outrage because it isn't a complete ban."

It's like marriage and divorce stats. The state gives you how many marriages and divorces happened in X year, and the _crude divorce rate_ is simply calculated from these two numbers. They don't track individual marriages to find out if a spouse died or they got divorced after 45 years."

Then there is of course the rule about ""No denigrating other subs for the quality of their content."" which is routinely violated when it some to talking about MGTOW1  and other subreddits you dislike which is amusing given your complaints about how MGTOW1 is moderated, a complaint I disagree with having seen nor had any issues with the moderation there.

>If your idea of ""going your own way"" is complaining about women, then this probably isnt the sub for you. 

While my idea is MGTOW is not complaining about women,  I left my rage phase well over 20 years ago.  I have been MGTOW for longer than MGTOW has been a thing on the internet,  and longer than many on this subreddit have been alive.  

However this subreddit seem to be more about Physical ""success"",  believing that the ""true path to MGTOW"" is body building gym rat shit.  I have no interest in that.  I pursue wealth building, FIRE, intellectual interests,  not dieting and exercise which seems to be focus of this place,  so you are likely correct this is not the subreddit for me

What you said about repeat offenders is your assumption, which isn‚Äôt true. Look at how many years somebody gets for selling or using cocaine vs crack cocaine. There‚Äôs a different in sentencing. Why? Because white people are usually the ones using cocaine while blacks use crack. Totally not racist right? Again, Brock Turner got released from prison because he was a ‚Äúgood athlete‚Äù, bet you the judge would have never thought of that had he been black. 

Also, yes, black people tend to have more criminal history than other races, but also because of the racist history our country has of keeping them under poverty. Banks wouldn‚Äôt loan blacks money for the housing market until very recently, 80‚Äôs or 90‚Äôs, something like that. Anyway my point here is that while not justifying it, it‚Äôs logical to believe a large group under poverty will do anything to survive, including crime. Then, you add the fact that job applications discriminate people based off their criminal history, and you get the high % of recidivism that the articles talked about. Not many opportunities + poverty + not allowing people to integrate back to society = perpetual criminal records."

I challenge mods all the time in Subreddits,  sometimes I am banned most times I am not.  I have challenges mods in MensRights, MGTOW, KIA, KIA2, and several others

I do not fear bans,  reddit to me a time suck,  something to do when I am bored.  I express myself if people want to ban me for that well that is their problem not mind.  Being a closed minded fool generally results in a shitty life. 

>But I'm not changing any of this sub because you disapprove

I am not asking you to,  I was simply pointing out the hypocrisy and bullshit.  I never had any expectation that my words would result in any changes. 

Subreddits like this never really grow beyond  a few thousands members because of the massive limitations on what can be talked about.  That can be a good thing, close knit communities can be good.  Sucks for a movement,  sucks if you are trying to bring actual awareness to what MGTOW is and how it can save men, but...

I browse MGTOW and MenRights in the hope that I can help a man cope with what is happening to him in his life,  this is why I am not put off by the posts in MGTOW1,  I want to help those men move past that rage on to something better.  You want to reject them and isolate them.  Different paths, different goals

>If you dont like them you can move on if you prefer. Nobody forces you to participate here. 

I probably will,  There is not much discussions here that interest me. I like to talk politics,  I like to discuss how the Culture war effects men, how politics effect men,  etc.  This is what I want to discuss,  you ban those discussions so...

Prior to that, I made multiple post, and karma was fine, so it was obvious my post weren't trolling.  Was banned, no explanation, and no response when responding to the ban."
1171,cardboardbox47,"The only downside to this sub is the woman, mgtow is suppose to be men only, and also you can get banned for saying stuff like men only. Its not too much to ask for a mens only sub, theres plenty of woman only subs and because mgtow is about helping fellow men and overcoming the need to socialize with females its only logical that it would be the sub that is specifically for men, by pushing females down our throats you are working against your goal and only making me not want to interact with woman more."
1172,YesIamALizard,"I got banned a few months ago, and just found this place.

You know what I was banned for? There was a sticky praising President Trump for nothing related to men's rights. I posted in the sticky, and I said... ""I don't see how this is related to Men Going Their Own Way""

I was banned. 

Sorry, but that proves that sub is a clown show."

Imagine having the ability to permanently silenced anyone you don't like,  and there is no one to challenge or question your decisions or motives. 

They are becoming the very thing they claim to be against.   Funny thing is, they will complain about being banned from other subs,  but they are doing the same thing, banning people for trivial reasons or 'wrong' think."
1175,Tyler_Morris,"There was a post that was hating on a 66 y/o woman for not fending off a pitbull that was mauling a child. Everyone in the thread was hating on her, saying women want equality but they're afraid to be heroes when the time comes.

They all neglected to mention the poor woman broke her arm when the dog attacked her, so she was in shock and unable to fight the dog. Luckily, a man was there to step in and save the child. He motioned for her to get help while he dealt with the dog.

Everyone in the thread ignored this part of the story, even when other people were posting links to the news article explaining the circumstances. The comments were disgusting, and not at all about GYOW.

So I posted links to several videos of women saving children from dangerous situations and then pointed out that there's a difference between going your own way and being a misogynist.

Ban came in 5 min later. Good riddance."
1176,TheSilverShade,"As a subscriber on both subs.

FYI 
calling women on their shit =/= hating on women.
Just so we're clear.

Mgtow is good for showing the double standards and women shenanigans

1184,Great_Sandwich,"Is this purported ""takeover"" of MGTOW *confirmed*, or is it merely speculation at this point?  

The one thing that *is* confirmed is that there certainly have been a lot of recent bans for the most innocuous of comments, lately.  They kicked my ass out yesterday.

And so significant are the number of bans that a mega-thread was created.  (GREATLY appreciated, by the way.  This helps.  Thank you.)

1188,ValhallaBoundBoy,"Banned with no explanation. After weeks of messaging mods one said that I was banned for 'concern trolling' and cited a specific post. The post in question was about a comment that people on the board make a lot, that 'women have nothing to contribute to a relationship'. Which made me think, What do we have to contribute to a relationship as men? Perhaps money, but what else?

It wasn't concern trolling it was a genuine question that wasn't just about everyone else, but about me as well. What do I really offer in a relationship?  A lot of people freaked out in the comments, kept insisting they have 'love, loyalty,' those vague intangible things a girl would say as well.

But some of them made a really great point: men are a human shield. We are expected to lay down our lives to protect a woman, even if we aren't dating her. If we are just walking down the same alley as a woman and someone comes after her, we are expected to put ourselves between her and the attacker. As for women we actually date, its basically a 'get out of jail free' card for as long as they keep us around"
1189,Superdogs5454,I got banned for saying that it‚Äôs not healthy to take steroids to a steroid user.

1192,UnfunnyName22,"Things Are Getting Out Of Hand (repost) (got banned from MGTOW for this statement)

Both MGTOW and feminism are at each other's throats like cats and rats and I'm getting confused about it all. There's so much hate that both sides have lost sight of what the actual point is. 

I thought we were all for equality, but all I see is women giving advice on how to subjugate a man, or men pushing for dystopian misogynistic ideals. At first, I was completely and utterly fooled by the MGTOW movement (being a man, of course) then after going through all the hostility, I see one post about someone climbing a beautiful mountain, achieving satisfaction, and being a better person from the experience. 

When I saw this, and then looked back at all the women slandering comments, I was like Jesus, this guy really knows what MGTOW really is. 

The people in that sub have got it all wrong, sure there IS inequality, but, throwing more fuel in the fire for feminist activists ain't gonna help.

I remember seeing a black man on TED who went to talk to the leader of the KKK himself, (link here -> https://youtu.be/ORp3q1Oaezw) and after so much diplomacy, got him to leave the group. It showed me that if each party respect each other, they'll bond and find trust within each other to work forward towards a common goal.

But with feminism (in it's current state) and MGTOW, it feels like the point is to pull each other apart as much as possible until a breaking point. Sure, there are pretty bad cases out there, but don't you think we should band together for a common purpose to change those laws and make it truly equal?

Both sides, men and women, have lost the point. MGTOW, if they are going their own way, need to cut out the obsession. Feminism and predominately 'feminine' groups such as the female dating advice subreddit, need to stop clearly trying to provoke bitterness between the genders and look for a common ground to start building good relationships with men over.

I'm just sick of it all, you can't trust neither side."
1193,Brandwein,"Banned from MGTOW for not hating women. Also banned from MensLib for beeing MGTOW. Yeesh. Seems like you can't not have radical opinions on reddit to not be banned.

1196,Notlikeotherguys,"I don't think anyone got banned.  We all got dumped somehow when they quarantined the sub.  I had to find it via a link and rejoin after aknowledging several times that I know I was joining a quarantined sub with ""extreme"" views."
1197,HohmannTransfer,When r/incels shut down I knew they would leak into a bunch of other subreddits and fuck them up.
1198,Mr_Crick84,"I was banned a while ago for simply saying a grown man had made the choice to be with a single mother and there is nothing wrong with that.

MGTOW was completely overrun with hateful incels and for some reason the mods were supporting them. All of a sudden incel terminology was being used to shame people that often had done nothing wrong.

To me, MGTOW was about internalising the rational male principles and choosing not to go along with it, Not trying to change human nature by shaming and hating on people.

For a group of incels that hated women and simps so much, They sure are sacrificing a lot to increase their SMV and be with them. I should have left a long time ago"
1199,Great_Sandwich,"Wtf..?  Seriously??  Yeah, I just got banned yesterday.  Why?  Couldn't tell you.  I think it could possibly be for referring a guy who laid out a bunch of VERY specific standards for the women he was looking for to a Christian dating site.

I basically just said that my thoughts vary from ""I'm 100% with you"" to ""sounds bitter, but for understandable reasons."" to ""WTF is wrong with you for glorifying sharia law?"". What should I say? Approximately 5 minutes after I posted this I got the notification that I'm permanently banned.

1207,ValhallaBoundBoy,"Someone had posted the very platitude driven kind of 'it gets better', and I argued against it. So I got banned.

For many men it doesn't get better, particularly if the child died instead of just being taken away."

1213,MisanthropeArtichoke,"I guess I have to join the club. The comment for which I was apparently banned related to a female astronaut collapsing during a press conference. The assertion made was that the collapse is proof that woman shouldn't be astronauts. 

My reply: ""Eh, I'd be leery of making assumptions. Maybe she's sick. Maybe her blood sugar was too low. There are a lot of explanations for a collapse. Maybe the stress of space travel, lack of gravity and whatnot, acts different on a woman's body. Who knows.

R/MGTOW has been infiltrated by feminists and women complaining, this place is next because you Simps create divisions instead of just saying the truth, which is no one was breaking the rules in mgtow, no one was inciting hatred, only support and calling women out in their bad behaviour was what it consisted of.

I said that it's possible to have relationships with women without marrying them or engaging in a LTR and called OP an incel because he is.

I'd been lurking there off and on for a while.  But the bullshit's gotten out of hand.  Yeah, there are a lot of shitty women out there, but I'm old enough and experienced enough to recognize red flags and avoid them.  Most of the posters there see fake red flags everywhere.  


Reddit's just an echo chamber.  I remember on an old account I got banned from /r/conservative for calling out anti-Trump conservatives prior to the election.  Then later I got banned from /r/The_Donald for criticizing a couple of Trump's policies.  I got banned from /r/news even though I never posted there.

1277,BeeleefAllWahmenz,I guess ‚Äúwho hurt you‚Äù really is applicable to those twats over there. Are they any better than the feminist mods banning people for no reason other than you said something that rubbed them the wrong way? I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre quarantined and hope they all get swatted.
1278,adax66,"I made comments about pro-circumcision purely from health point of view and got lambasted for my opinion. I think a lot of foreskin lovers cannot accept different opinions, even though the scientific evidence is overwhelming on the benefits of circumcision. I think  prejudice still pervades because circumcision are common practices for Jews and Muslims and therefore it will always be viewed with biasses. I was banned for my opinion. I suppose the mod must be foreskin lover MGTOW."
1279,the_ultimate_salvaje,"Left a comment on mgtow and got banned

So someone posted a picture of baby yoda saying he was born a mgtow and I explain that there is no such thing only incels are born that way. I explained that Incels love to claim mgtow cause they can‚Äôt get women but the women they do they will become a fierce little male feminist and will turn on mgtow. I know this cause I seen it with my own eyes and for saying this I was ban.  Luckily I used a throwaway account but wow I can‚Äôt believe that mgtow defends incels as if we are all incels if I wanted to be part of a incel community then I would but then again I can‚Äôt cause I‚Äôm not ugly or fat or short so I don‚Äôt fall under any of those categories. The reason why I‚Äôm a mgtow is cause I been with too many women and they are all the same. Incels want to believe they are truly mgtows but are you truly a mgtow if you never even experienced betrayed by a women? Dated one after finding mgtow and realizing that everything said her is true? Maybe is just me. 

Ps don‚Äôt ban cause I‚Äôm not a fucking incel. I‚Äôm a mgtow but not a incel."

1281,durzashade22797,"Someone posted on the subreddit trashing K-pop groups for wearing makeup on stage calling it the results of women's drive to feminize men and all that BS, calling them Simps and shit. Now I didnt care incredibly much about K-pop I'll admit, but what I did care about, and I felt was worth discussing is the stigma behind makeup itself and masculinity, and how just because someone wears makeup to enhance their features and cover imperfections so they'd feel more confident about themselves doesnt make them less manly or a simp or a fag (a word I saw frequently in the comments) because there are plenty of perfectly good (and straight) dudes who rock a face of natural makeup. It was a stupid argument I'll admit, and I regret getting involved in it, however i dont I deserved a ban. Especially since the way I see it, a man going his own way to feel confident about himself in whatever ways he sees fit whether it be regular gym visits or regular sephora visits without worrying about what other think is a fairly MGTOW concept."

1283,RetroSpud,"Beaned for calling out misogyny, my comment had like 20 upvoted lmao"
1284,NotAnotherDingBat,I simply mentioned that most of them have not gone their own way. They‚Äôve replaced dating women and being taken advantage of with using all of their energy with resenting them. Moving on is moving on. They‚Äôre out of sight out of mind. It shouldn‚Äôt mean you become more obsessed. And I was banned
1285,Immarrrtal,Got banned for asking about wanting to live life with a kid or two but without a wife. Like wtf MGTOW
1286,RIPOldAccountF,I got banned for saying that telling women that they should have kids asap because their best years for statistically having the best chance at healthy offspring is probably not the best idea. That along with welfare(single moms make up 75% of welfare) are contributing to young single moms which lowers the pool of women men would want to date.
1287,TheValhallaBoy,"I haveb een banned again. This is my third time. The mod I had reached out to last time suggested I just create a new account so I did, and it's been less than a week, I've only gained 100 karma, and I'm already banned. No idea why. I refused to even get into disagreements this time, but it looks like asking for male only movies and making the title a tongue in cheek 'sexist movie club suggestions' was enough to do it."
1288,TheHentaiEnthusiast,"I recently posted something I seriously needed for my gender equality school report. Since MGTOW supported men, I asked about what the men of that sub thought regarding forced and toxic masculinity, and their personal experiences regarding it. I just asked. That's it. 2 mins later, I got banned - straight after a bunch of dudes flamed the comments, angry at feminists and somehow missing the whole point of the question being for my freaking school report. I'm not sure if anyone else will be willing to share feedback at this point, or also downvote me to hell lmao"

That you can live and be perfectly happy with your friends, your wealth, your health, your wisdom and hobbies that you enjoy.

1337,realMisterBryan,"Yeah I got banned for something similar. Someone was insulting the fact that AOC (who I don't even like) is *just a bartender* (which is totally false, she's a congresswoman now) and I said it would be like insulting Trump because he's *just a TV show guy* (which is also false, he's the president now).

Here is the comment:

https://old.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/ekenqp/the_word_men_is_missing_from_this_because_men/fdb5vf4/

TL;DR - there must be a real fag in the MGTOW mod team. I bet he rides a harley too."
1338,bhfanatik,"seems like it has become a MAGA sub. Any opinion criticizing Trump is downvoted to the abyss or even banned. They pretend they're going their own way but they fantazise about a conservative society and obssess about ""owning the libs""."
1339,MuleFool42,"Yep. They trigger easily to anything that doesn't conform exactly to their belief system. I don't get it. MGTOW should be for every man to understand as a lifestyle or philosophy to live by if they so choose. Everyone guy will have his own version of MGTOW, it doesn't have to be one-size-fits-all. 

Very limited thinking over there."
1340,Impossible-asset,"You're right. ""Calling attention to"" something =/= hate. 

Here's the rub. It is *easy* to bitch about something that bothers you. It often takes much more introspection and thought to come up with a solution. 

Here, this sub is aimed as representing the positive sides of mgtow. What is can do *for* a man, vs just complaining about women. 

Now, maybe by tightening things up on the posting guidelines, the sub might shrink. I'm good with that if what does get posted is positive and helps men show their accomplishments, or have meaningful discussions focusing on living a full and satisfying life vs complaining about the ""nature of wahmen"" and such. 

Jokes and memes and posts bitching about women have their place, it's just not this sub, and to allow the posts that focus on women or ""calling then out"", just detracts from the goal of this sub."

First, it means that you care and that you're giving power to the other person. It also isn't good to let hate rule your life because it's unhealthy. 

They absolutely couldn't have that, I suppose. I was banned with no explanation because their a bunch of scared little bitches that can't actually admit to their hate or they'll be quarantined. So they won't say anything,just ban people with no explanation."

Mgtow gives zero shits about any of that. It is what it is and we're perfectly content to walk away from it, and the culture that goes with. 

I have no bitterness towards women or feminists. Their bullshit doesnt stop me from getting laid as I please, without having to compromise my own self-interest, and no risk of sexual harassment or divorce rape.

I just go to other places where the cancer of femenism has not spread. 

If you want to change laws and have some sort of ""come together"" moment, you are in the wrong place.

1410,Impossible-asset,"I disagree with that assessment. 

You're combining two different things.

Men who desire women but cant ""get"" them are involuntary celibate men aka incels or omega males etc. 

Mgtow men are men who *could* (and in the vast majority of cases, have) had women, and were often married, but have been burned by the courts in a divorce or seen how society supports the word of a woman in judgement versus the evidence given by a man. 

Both men may be angry, but incels *stay* angry. 

Men going their own way have decided that they want to simply walk away from the laws, gynocentric society, and drama that marriage and formal relationships bring."

Go fuck yourself. The original sub did start becoming hateful, that's why the first rule of this sub says no women-hating, hate and negativity. 

And when it comes to the negativity part, I consider all the shit I just said to be pretty fucking positive, considering the fact that you just called all of us simps when this a place for people that live a life of not being a simp. Go fuck yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

1413,rockydoo1,"The problem is a lot of them are mgtow because they have no choice.  They have to go their own way because no woman wants to be with them because of their anti female attitude.   True meaning of incel.

I got called an incel because I didn't agree with a teenager that happened to be female getting away with possessing alcohol out in the open by a cop.
I said it was a perfect time for her to learn a lesson and hopefully it doesn't lead to her drinking and driving.

And yup. He caught a 90 day ban. 

Why?

Because his posts on ""pointing out the misandry"" were removed. He was told why. He was told this is not the sub for that. He wanted to insist that oh yes it was too the sub for that, and went posting more ""misandry"" stuff. He was again told not too, and instead this time told to focus on himself in a post not on women or the system... he again refused.. so .... yeah, the guy caught a *Temporary* ban, and was told he'd be welcomed back to post content that follows the rules and spirit of this sub when he returns. Instead he went to another sub and started yapping about this one. Ok then. 

Glass house my ass .... go over to mgtow1 and post some shit there and see how far that gets you with the mods. 

See if they dont bamhammer you immediately with no explanation or response to a message. 

Maybe go over to r / aww and post pictures of animal abuse because you're trying to ""expose those abusers""... let me know how fast you get banned from there. 

Dont come here, break the rules, ignore warnings, then get pissy when you catch a temporary ban because of it.

Seriously, go take a look at /r/FemaleDatingStrategy and come back with that 'just fall on your sword, bro' bullshit. It's all a game, and females are playing it to win(And by win, I mean extort the ever living fuck out of your before ghosting out and then telling all their friends and family you were a terrible person to justify their robbery or even outright malicious behavior done purely for entertainment). Most MGTOW, outside of the incels who are just shouting at the sky, are dudes that have already been burned and black pilled by things like marriage, and are now just doing what women have been doing for forever: Playing the game in their own way.

I might get banned for this comment because as a reddit moderator (very possibly female) i do not how easily aggravate and offended you are, honestly after the initial experience i got after voicing my toned down and respectful opinion i wouldnt mind not continuing to visit this sub, this not an invitation to ban me though."

Trump was a famous billionaire playboy. He literally won life and was the man everyone aspired to be, that gives him intrinsic respect, it shows he is good at life.

Your right. It's time that women learn about the reasons why more and more men are disinterested in marriage, having own kids or just being in a relationship. It doesn't have to be in a way that tells us ""you're all a bunch of disgusting evil shits without morals and the only way you're good for is to wreck a men."" more like ""hey. No need to be mad. It's just that the current laws disadvantages us and we don't want to risk losing our money and even freedom. It's just self defense that, hopefully, sounds logical to you."" just to answer some questions other women might have. 
I understand your reasons why you avoid women in the way you do and I feel really bad for you. If it would be men who could completely destroy me after divorcing I would want to stay away from them as well. 

Let's just hope that government wakes up, changes the laws that allow women to ruin their men if they divorce and starts letting men keep their money and property and treats them equally to women when the question who gets the custody over the kids needs to be answered.

I do think that talking shit about women certainly has its place. Consider golf courses or cigar clubs or poker tables. Men need a spot to complain amongst themselves about shit that frustrates them, and for a lot of men, that is women.

Angry.  Frustrated.  Needing closure on what she did.  Trying to get past it.  Trying to heal.  Trying to keep to the high road, without sending her that final email I've been fucking holding myself back from sending...

1622,Impossible-asset,"You are missing the point. 

Mgtow has nothing to do with a desire to ""get"" a woman. 

Mgtow is largely a response to bullshit divorce laws that absolutely destroy a mans life, a rejection of societal endorsement of that, and the newer phenomenon of using false sexual impropriety accusations to destroy a man (reference the New York times best seller list for the how-to manual for that). 

The response that mgtow chooses is to simply take the assets that would have otherwise been spent on maintaining a relationship (or later lost in a divorce) and spending it on ones own happiness and health instead. Walking away. 

That's what mgtow is. 

Yeah I'm an aging loser, all I've got are my friends, my almost paid for house, good income, freedom to do what I want with who I want and when I want, and a brewery. Poor me.

>We need a community that doesn't ban men for trying to gather and help each other, and every other social media platform is happy to censor or ban any and all men's content if it isn't tits, ass, and/or beer.

Reddit admins are far above mods. If they don't like your sub, they'll find an excuse to quarantine/ban it. See the Trump-friendly sub for example.  They can even go into the database and directly edit comments without any trace. If you want to create a free speech community, reddit is not your best bet, and I have no idea what is. Sites like discord demand your phone number for """"verification"""", and if you happen to live in a country where burner phones are banned _(muh terrorism)_ then it's pretty much self-doxxing."

To me, that is the whole idea behind MGTOW- having the courage to do what is right for you regardless of societal expectations.

I would say guys do it to but they are either assholes or being sarcastic and will let you know right away. But even the assholes are rather rare in doing this because they know such behavior could lead to an asswhupping or at least people not wanting to hang around them.

Some single women seem to think they are above society's niceness as though they were a celebrity. They see nothing wrong shit testing their host despite the obvious rudeness of it all.

However there is another reason for it as well. They think being a bitch makes them more attractive because they have been picked up by guys who were jerks to them. It's a reversal of expectations. Girls are used to guys being nice to them so they take it for granted. When a decent looking guy comes along and doesn't kiss her ass, she thinks he must be on a higher tier therefore she finds him more attractive than the nice guys. 

Guys are more used to women being bitches to them or at least cold and indifferent. Guys are just likely to be put out by a bitchy woman either getting angry or losing their self esteem. The guys not phased by it are the usual pump&dumpers whom the girls later will claim they are tired of due to all the ghosting."

This is extremely true. I don't come from a background of having been screwed over, my marriage never had time to go bad. So i never developed the personal distaste. Thus, i don't avoid women at all except the part of being alone with one.   


But i do see that the more attractive ones are the ones that can't in the least understand why they're not wrapping me around their finger.   


To be honest, If i would say that I have a ""type"" these days.. even though i don't engage.. It would be the plain janes. They are usually much more relaxed about things.

They want to feel like they've made a guy their little chump, to manipulate.
I'd say its quite fashionable for the female to have a little pussy-begger-slave behind her as I see this sort of behavior quite frequently. In my opinion, it gets her respect and jealousy from the others in the female collective or ""hivemind"".

And despite my username an excellent father as well haha. We've been talking divorce because despite doing well I just haven't had the ""passion"" she craves. Kinda hard to be passionate when she won't even touch me.  But I do speak her love language which is gift giving and words of affirmation. It just hasn't been doing anything. I told her maybe talking divorce would ignore that spark in me to want that from happening. How could I fear losing her and divorce if we didn't go through with it? And it did. Started researching and man...fuck I just don't want to do it lol. I know id be settling and that's a bitch thing to do but I just want to be absolutely sure for the sake of our child.

Well come to find out she's been cheating on me. Just found out last week actually. I don't know all the nittty gritty details and honestly I just don't care or need to know..I know all I need to know which is to get the fuck out while I can. 2 wrongs don't make a right and we both have contributed to making a shitty situation

So yeah...I just have zero fucks to give right now. We're going through with divorce and keeping it amicable. We're going mediation route, no lawyers. We make the same amount and want to split everything evenly which I'm cool with.

I'm just a bit scared in how I'll survive on just my income. Family is a state away. Ill be ok just may have to do some side gigs or get a 2nd job and figure out if renting an apartment or owning a condo/townhome would be best for me. A lot to think over.

1670,iluvfrostidflaks,this is what i was thinking. i disagree with the prevailing attitude that almost all of them want a guy they see as strong. i think what they are looking for is that docile and thirsty chump who will worship them no matter what they do.
1671,Heisenbergeffect,"Here's some things that helped me early on.   


Set up a home, make it your way and start living in it like YOU want to. But, my one big advice is this. Keep it clean. There is nothing that can bring your spirits down like a messy home, and once it gets really messy, the task of cleaning it seems bigger and bigger. It took a long time before I managed to pull myself together and start doing this right. But it made a huge difference in how i felt about myself. As well as being able to open the front door and not be embarrassed. I was in a long slump and my house was a total mess.   


Don't live to impress, get only the home you need. There's only 5 people in the world that actually care about your home, the rest are either ok with whatever you have or jealous. And you don't need jealousy in your life.   


Wealth protection before generation. Pay off your debts, even if it sucks. Don't start to try and invest etc until you have your debt situation well under control. ESPECIALLY high interest debt. a 19% credit card is a much better investment to pay off than the stock market. And once you start owning things that other people have payments on, you'll see how much money that actually is. I couldn't believe how much money I was able to save once I had no more payments. Even though I understood it theoretically, the feeling once you see the numbers start adding up in your accounts is pretty powerful.   


And above all else. One day at a time, nothing happens immediately."
1672,ValhallaBoundBoy,You're getting full / majority custody?
1673,MementoMordor,"They can't help it. It's in their DNA to test potential partners, they are not bad people. Just be aware.
In your case, she probably saw you as a provider of some sort. They have different rules for this and the ones they really want. 
Maybe you are soft or you got played by her or yourself. Learn, accept, adapt! (sounded like a self help book there :))"
1674,Uniqueinsult,"Well this is how the story goes these days man. I woke up at 17 after dating a crazy young woman, tested the waters of a relationship again at 18. Conclusion: weird world we are living in."
1675,BadDad01234,"This is all amazing advice thanks! Especially keeping my place clean. Our house as it is is a nightmare half the time and constantly smells. My STBXW just doesn't clean. At all. So most of the cleaning duties fall on me so I'm already used to it but it will be much easier solo. 

Fortunately I'm debt free. Unbeknownst to me my wife wracked up quite a bit of debt over the past few years. I might have some responsibility with that which sucks but you're right I will get whatever comes my way cleaned up first. I don't know much about investing anyways I do have a 401k going which is good tho"
1676,BadDad01234,50/50 which we are both cool with. She needs her mom and dad and we don't want anything less. As shitty as it is to say the week off will be nice to recharge (and make money hopefully) We've been doing it for a bit actually in just handling responsibility and it's honestly made me a better dad. I go hard on the love and attention and focus when I know she relies on me and no one else. I like it. And like that Louis CK bit at the end of the week I can take a bath in vodka and my own filth lol. I can be a killer dad half the time
1677,,[deleted]
1678,Heisenbergeffect,"Not sure about the facts in your case, but yeah, depending on your state and WHEN she racked up that debt, you're probably going to owe half of it. 

Seen that happen too many times."
1679,ValhallaBoundBoy,Ah okay. When I hear 'single parent' i tend to think of the parent having majority / full custody.
1680,ValhallaWillCome,">They have different rules for this and the ones they really want.

He's implying that you were not the one she really wanted. It's not a diss, he's merely implying she may have thought you fell under the beta bucks category (aka, the one she wants to settle for) and you not accepting her bs put an end to that. You did the right thing."
1681,nostonewhereIlay,"I see your in the States, not sure about your laws but in Canada you are not responsible for your wife or live-in‚Äôs debt unless you specifically signed for joint responsibility. Luckily I was just reading this yesterday at a consumer proposal site. So if you didn‚Äôt sign specifically your in the clear, at least in Canada."
1682,BadDad01234,Ah yeah that makes sense. Wrong phrasing lol. Divorce isn't actually too common in my circle I guess. Divorced dad I guess I should say.
1683,iluvfrostidflaks,i‚Äôm referring to his ‚Äúmaybe you are soft and got played‚Äù comment. nothing i posted earlier even implies that. thats a passive-aggressive sneak diss from out of nowhere. you gotta be a real bitch and a loser trying to build self esteem to act that way.
1684,ValhallaBoundBoy,"Your vernacular is cool with me, pretty sure most people use it the way you do, not the way I do. NGL week on and week off does sound like a nice lifestyle. Perhaps I'll find a lady one day who wants that kind of arrangement."
1685,ValhallaWillCome,"Rereading the entire thread, it may have been a diss indeed. Problem is that I can interpret  ‚Äúmaybe you are soft and got played‚Äù two ways. One being a diss and the other being a hint. Not putting up with BS is one, it's how you end the argument that either shows her whether you are ""strong"" or are feigning ""strong"". This is something women will pick up on rather easily, where you may not have. If he meant that, it's a hint. If not, a diss."
1686,iluvfrostidflaks,"i see your point. if thats what he meant then i‚Äôll apologize for my other comments, but it really looks more like some random sneaky insult. and the point of what i said earlier is that these sort of tests and other asshole behavior won‚Äôt get women very far with men unless they find one who is willing to put up with it. in my case most of it was unwarranted and i stood up for myself early on after noticing a pattern of totally unwarranted bs. thats when she took off. lol."

Guys. Am I missing something here? This sub states it's for focusing on independant male life, not for focusing on women, and yet here is another shitpost about johnny Depp's girlfriend.

So. Heres what I'm thinking. Since I can remove these posts / lock these posts all day long and they just seem to keep on showing up. I'm thinking every time some OP who isnt an obvious alt account or troll breaks the rules, I lock the post, and then give OP 24 hours to post something about how mgtow is helping their life. With a positive perspective, or take a ban that gives them enough time to think something up. 

I'm serious... this is NOT a carbon copy or refugee camp for men who want to lay claim to being ""mgtow"" and just spending their time bitching and complaining about women. 

THINK about what mgtow is doing for you to make YOU better. Then post that. You can talk about where YOU used to be when you were blue pulled, and you can relate that to where you are now that you are a mgtow. 

That's what this sub is for, and constantly removing posts and saying ""refer to sub rules"" is not being as effective as I'd like in promoting the content this sub was meant to showcase. 

So... comments locked. Timer started. OP will you be a participant of this sub how it was intended for mgtow men? Or not."

1741,30203forever,"Yep. If there was only one thing to remember about women (and the primate females in general: Thank you David Attenborough!) it's that they are biologically amoral.

Sorry dog lovers -- I tried getting a dog and it just didn't do it for me.

It is possible to get plenty of physical affection without sex, romantic love, or commitment, via professional cuddlers. If that had been available to me in the past, it would have saved me a lot of depressive episodes and other disasters in my life."

1747,DigitalScetis,"I'm surprised to see a blue check mark say something like that.

The reason is that, for the past several years, we've seen nothing but all these stories about how ""science shows"" that men ""need"" sex and female companionship to be ""healthy.""

There are still some who are sticking by that, like the Campaign Against Sex Robots woman.  I've also seen some pushback against that from the femmstappo, specifically the whole complaint about the tendency for men to be ""emotional golddiggers"" on their wives, and that the wives need to be compensated for the ""unpaid emotional labor"" of loving their husbands...or...something...

Which means that more and more people, I think, are going to come around to our point of view.  And if folks like Sprankle won't, the feminists surely will, when they actually think about this ""need for human companionship"" and ""empathy,"" and realize the implications for them."

1756,Robert_is_a_Loser,"Yes absolutely get a life before considering getting a girlfriend. The last thing you want to do is make your girlfriend your ""life"" It's a mistake many guys make (including myself back in the day) 

Just become familiar of female nature to protect youself. If you have a life before dating you have the freedom to ""not take no shit"" when it comes to her because if you leave her you will immediately have more time and money to do what you want to do."
1757,Hawgster,After being betrayed and divorced. Still losing so much financially to it every month. I don't think I care to find a woman ever again. Just look forward to the rare times when I can get my kids. Pretty much what I live for at this point.
1758,GlobalAsshat,"That's really the way to do it. You hear that old cliche that you have to love yourself before you can love someone else. Life goes in a natural progression where important skills are built as you grow up and a lot of people get fucked up in childhood by not having good parents, a good father figure, or a good circle of friends, and that fucks up their personality, so they end up socially awkward, lacking the ability to hold an interesting conversation or make people laugh or in general small talk, and for men this really gives them a big disadvantage with women and life in general if they can't fix it.

Social-proofing is by far the most important skill to have in life. It's one of the essential skills that leads to a stepping stone to bigger things in life. A large majority of men have varying levels of beta in them but the ones who don't grow up socially well adjusted really end up being the ""creeps"" of society. There's also the matter of having no father figure and an overprotective, coddling mother... I've seen examples of what happens to kids with this situation, still living with grandma at age 40.. nice enough guys but never really pushed to be independent in any way. Women can get away with this because men are always chasing and ""saving"" them, but for men this will lead to a feeling of unfulfillment because men are biologically wired to want to achieve greatness."
1759,CDAYt,"Women? Bah! I‚Äôm chasing money fam.

1765,Traveler11819,"what's the old saying?

You will lose a lot of money chasing women.. but you won't lose women chasing money"
1766,rockstarsheep,"No matter what anyone says, your biology is going to predispose you towards wanting to mate. At a certain age, when your sex hormones kick in, and you have a sex drive, as sure the moon exerts an influence on the tides - you are going to feel a pull towards whatever is your sexual preference. That's just Nature / Life at work. It's an undeniable fact, for most people. 

Unfortunately, this can play havoc with you. And it does; for men and women. As this sub is focused on men and men's issues, we focus on that. In a way, ""MGTOW"" or ""GYOW"" is really a form of transcendency. That is to say, to transcend your natural drives; master them and shape them, so you create a form of life that suits you best. That's really just the beginning though. 

Over time, you change as a man. Your testosterone levels go up, peak, and then come down. Many men, mellow out, with time and age. They are less aggressive or seek to be less dominant over others. And a whole host of other changes.

There's inherently wrong with having different kinds of relationships with people. In fact, you need to relate and work with many different kinds of people over your life time. Men and Women, have been trying to figure each other out for who knows how long. Perhaps since the dawn of time. We form complex relationships with each other; whether it's family, friends or lovers. Some are long term relationships and some are short term. We all make mistakes; every single one of us. It's how we work towards resolving them, which counts more than anything else. Unfortunately we live in a very strange time, where there is a sort meaning vacuum and people are just super confused. A lot of ""traditional"" ideas, have been thrown away, being considered old fashioned, useless and meaningless. However, that can't all be true though. 

* Dignity
* Trust
* Faithfulness
* Honour
* Responsibility
* Integrity

Are these values and virtues, really to be thrown in the trashcan? I don't think so. 

And really, finding someone to really bond with, is incredibly, if not the most difficult thing to achieve. It does seem like a fairytale. I can maybe count three couples, over the course of the last almost half-century, that I consider to have a really good, mutually beneficial relationship. The next segment is okay, to not so great and then there's a vast gulf of just mediocre, to terrible and then awful. But it is indeed possible to find someone decent. How, when and where? Nobody can answer that. 

And my friend, the only thing set in stone is that you are born and that you will die. Everything is up for grabs. Probabilities and possibilities; you just don't know. The likelihood of better results, depends on you and the decisions that you make. You may need to take your time and work hard at yourself and those you allow in to your inner world. You probably will. 

The only ""advice"" I can give is to vet everyone in your inner world. Make sure that they add to your world and you add to theirs. More than likely the emptiness you feel, probably really has nothing to do with women as such, but about the meaning and purpose that you are going to give and find in your life. Seek that out first, and everything else can fit in around that."
1767,starfox863,Good for you
1768,Erwinblackthorn,"Women don't fill the void. They chain us to decrease our options. That's why they are called the old ball and chain.

Think about trying to travel somewhere. First you need permission from your bank, to see if you have the money. Then you need permission from your job, so you don't get fired. Then you need permission from the government to see if you have a visa. Then you need permission from the airline to see if you have a plane that will take you. Then after all that, you need permission from the girl.

She's at the top of the permission pyramid. The one factor that doesn't even involve the actual travel process, and this is the one that has top priority. And if you don't please that one, your trip becomes a miserable mess that you paid for.

That's the kind of stuff that makes us go ""why the hell do I bother adding that extra factor, when it doesn't even please me? What are my options?""

I know the options: hand, porn, hoe. HPH, or HPP if you want to pay for a prostitute."
1769,copper_blood,Also make sure your new girlfriend has a life too.
1770,Aszourus,"Saying the point of MGTOW is to not have a girlfriend is thinking with the original r/MGTOW mentality. Not all women are the same just like not all men are pigs. AWALT is a childish concept.
There are still women who submit to their men and are mother and caretaker figures who don't mind life being that way, these women are also hated by feminists. There's even women who actively have been fighting for men's rights before you guys even knew of this whole movement so be a little adult and logical and realize that while the majority of women all think the same there's always an exception to the rule.
Saying stuff like this is just like feminists saying all men cheat and all men are toxic.
MGTOW is putting yourself first, learning to recognize the toxic women and avoid them, doing what you want on your terms. If she wants to be in your life there's sacrifices she should make. And just like people said here, don't settle with anyone in any way that makes them entitled to take your shit from you. Be the best version for yourself that you can be, and don't let any woman stand in your way. If she doesn't like it that way then she can take the highway."
1771,bassheadstang,"Women are a burden on men, especially when you live with them.

Tinder hookups come at a price. Bitches be crazy but I did meet a few that are cool. 

I kinda fell into the poly lifestyle and have become what‚Äôs known as solo-poly. I don‚Äôt live with women or commit to one woman. I‚Äôve actually had a few at the same time recently. They have nesters that do all the bf/husband shit and I‚Äôm just the swinging dick. I currently have 5 on a rotation. They feed me and clean my house and drain my balls. I don‚Äôt have to do shit. They have no reason to lie yet some still can‚Äôt help it. It‚Äôs pretty sweet over all but you have to know women."
1772,neri_Skabadu,Both people should be in a right place for a relationship so if you're not ready never rush into it because it can ruin you.

1780,soelc3,"> Women can get away with this because men are always chasing and ""saving"" them, but for men this will lead to a feeling of unfulfillment because men are biologically wired to want to achieve greatness.

And maybe this is a part of our nature that works against us, an evolutionary baggage we're better off casting aside. By definition, only a minority can achieve greatness, because to be great means to be great relative to someone else. The majority of men are going to lose in the arms race of greatness, just like the majority of men will be betas no matter how much lifting and self-improvement they do, because the game is always graded on a curve. Individual men can rise up and down the hierarchy, but only at the expense of other men, as the 80/20 rule remains in place. What the majority of men need is compassion and a path forward, to self-esteem and self-actualization, that doesn't rely on throwing themselves into Darwin's grinder for a shot at reproduction."
1781,CalmElk,">for men this really gives them a big disadvantage with women and life in general if they can't fix it.

Why do men need to attract women before they can go MGTOW? This sounds like gatekeeping.

Why do I need to care about the rat race? I just want to go my own way.

People should love themselves but they shouldn't have to attract women and reach the top of society to prove their value."
1782,avtarius,The point of MGTOW is playing the game on your own terms ... Not all MGTOW are monks
1783,1st10Amendments,"AIUI, the point to MGTOW is to avoid entangling interactions with females; by which I mean no LTR in one‚Äôs personal life and to be VERY careful in one‚Äôs business dealings with women. 

For some MGTOW, a STR MAY be a risk worth taking, but NOT to cohabitate or to intermingle finances in any way. 

For others, it may mean Monk Mode, whether that‚Äôs be for a short term or permanently. 

Other than that, MGTOW is about self-actualization and personal growth. 

But I could be wrong. YMMV."

Through some of my other comments, there are glimmers of the truth. To put a finer point on things; no, I haven't. I suppose if I might be able to help others, then I could be persuaded to discuss my blunders and the insights I have derived from them. Truly it is a treasure trove of what not to do, and occasionally a nugget of wisdom. 

What have I started, very slowly, is to create some YouTube content. It's not specifically MGTOW, but it is related to finding and living in a meaningful way. Believe it or not, I have some training as a therapist, so it integrates some of that. 

Now, if you have a particular subject that you find important and might want me to write on, I would be happy to consider it as a contribution here. What do you think?"
1798,Aszourus,"Exactly.

We spend years spoiling the shit out of women, meeting every single expectation they have and then complain about them being spoiled. Works the same as with your kids.

1801,TheVineyard1996,It's about not having a woman dictate your life. If we want romantic exclusivity and sexual fidelity then that is fine as long as it is on our OWN terms. Understand?

1811,rockstarsheep,"Pick something that is relevant to you. That always makes it easier. 

You have touched on a very interesting subject though. In fact this might be something to explore. What is it though? 

There is no *summa summarum*; which means. There is a sum of all sums. A coherent system of hypotheses; whether these are ideas that come to us from the sciences, philosophy or any of the other humanities - that neatly folds things together. At least not in this particular subject. 

It would then appear, that there is no central theme, beyond the very narrow confines of such ideas as - hypergamy^‚Ä¢. 

^‚Ä¢= I call to attention, the notion of hypergamy, because it is one of the bedrock concepts of RP ideology, as it relates to the nature of women; and for two reasons. 

The first is that it might very well be a retrospective projected idea, less than what reality actually is, in itself. Some academic work has begun to actually interrogate this concept, and it would appear, that it may not be completely true in an absolute sense. 

Now, this is not unusual. Often, with knowledge, and the discovery of it, we can at times, mislabel certain phenomena, because we either do not understand it.  Or, out of convenience, impose a definition that is meant to be temporary, but through common use, becomes the standard definition. 

That is to say, it may indeed be incorrect. This poses a problem to someone like Rollo Tomassi, Richard Cooper and a whole slew of others, who have purchased their position of authority on either, misinformation, disinformation, or pure chicanery. They have a vested interest in maintaining and defending their position, because, in one way or another, their relevance and in some cases, their income relies on this. They have a vested interest in their truth, as it pays them to do so. They have an incentive here, which also stretches further in to the lives of those who take their thoughts, opinions and insights as incontrovertible truth. 

As no one has risen to the challenge, or indeed opportunity, to test the hypothesis of hypergamy as such, the idea and those who advocate it, have been safe in their assumptions. However, this is slowly changing. There may be an element of truth to it, however, it may also be, that it has been starkly over emphasised. 

Just recently, Shawn T. Smith; a highly trained and capable psychologist, has very politely, questioned hypergamy. And it with some interest that I watched Rollo squirm, as the headlights of professional rigour and experience, started to question, what really might be a pet theory at best and pure speculation at worst. 

Rollo has the gift of the gab, and can twine a word salad of concepts and ideas, in order to muddy the water. He can, as a fall back, cling to the notion of the stories he has heard from others, and use this as proof. Now, there may be some truth, in the stories of others, but there is such a lack of sophistication in terms of definitions and the collection of data, for the purposes of deriving some sort of truth; that cottage wisdom will do ... for now. 

That is not to victimise or lionise him. We all make judgments of error, and believe in incorrect assessments. Every one of us. It just gets highly amplified when a personal misgiving is transmitted to a broader audience, that then accepts it as unquestionable truth. The concept may require some calibration, however, that may cause the invalidation of some of the key premises. 

We will see if the truth is more important than the individual, in good time. 

Now, the second part is this. 

The nature of men. I have yet to encounter a term, such as hypergamy, when it relates to the *innate nature of men*. I am quite confident that the feminists would clamber to screech out the term; Patriarchy! 

Laughable as that is, it is still a very powerful concept at play in our world. It is at best, a shorthand summary to describe how women have been exploited and victimised for the benefit of men. Now, before I descend in to that pit of hell, I'll stop. And continue as such.

Men **and** Women can behave themselves in less than ideal ways. Both sexes can be destructive, shameless, thoughtless, cruel and otherwise indifferent. On the reverse of this, both sexes can be creative, remorseful, thoughtful, kind and interested. Some men **and** women, can exhibit more or less of the above. And we can further narrow things down. 

Moving on; some men are not particularly fantastic human beings. They can exhibit some of the lesser qualities that they're accused of, but to wholesale clump everyone together, is a massive mistake. This also brings in to question, the measure or measures by which we want to judge men or women. Who is deriving the score card, and how are they keeping score? What are they enumerating and quantifying, for the purposes of judgment. Nobody really seems to know. It is taken as a given. 

There are no easy to grasp values to use, but general concepts of acceptable behaviour. They in themselves can be horrible stereotypes, or indeed, truths. 

So, we seem to lack a critical framework, by which to evaluate and comment on the nature  of men and women. Beyond the tropes of; ""Lift and make bank!"" 

My little conclusion is this. We need to be critical of accepted wisdoms, or apparent truths, and not go with face value agreements of their validity. We need to have proper discussions to explore the ideas that we have been given. To me, that is an essential part of going your own way; responsibility for the evaluation of information, for the purpose of defining a set of values that you can live a good life by. 

A very big problem to overcome, is the demands of immediacy. Now, now, now. Most good things, do not come about in the - *right here and now*. They take time to cultivate. It takes work. It requires some humility, patience and courage. And most of all, it demands honesty. That my good friend, is quite difficult to achieve. And it is a problem that has been with us, for a very long time.

So, there you go! My little thoughts for the day. Thank you for your kindness and I hope that you are keeping and doing well."
1812,Aszourus,"I am talking about also our responsibility, you say media as if it's an entity of its own run by itself. Let me remind you most big media corporations are run by men themselves. So yes we have been digging our own graves for years. The existence of simps should be proof enough that enough men keep catering to women and in turn making then expect that kind of behaviour from everyone. and BTW I'm not the op, I'm not chasing any dragon. I am a happily single man doing my thing. But that doesn't mean I am not reasonable or logical enough to realize that you can not neither man or women 100% all in one group and say ALL of these people are the same. Believing that is plain ignorant, even though j agree there aren't many women who are different."

1828,Impossible-asset,"Tomorrow is Valentines day. 

I call it Ballentines day, (an ENTIRELY underrated scotch, fellas. I mean no shit, its GOOD).

So I treat myself usually by getting dressed up, I buy myself a long-stem rose and go to a steak house. I'll have a scotch (most places have at least a couple good selections). And I'll have a big fat porterhouse. I have beer with my porterhouse. Good Dark beer. Then I pay my bill and leave. But heres the twist. I leave the OTHER rose that I dried over the mantle for a year on the table, and take the new one home to dry. I put it in the mantle over the fireplace to dry out in the coming year. Yes I do this, yes its kindof stupid, and I enjoy it immensely.

I take the bill for the evening and I total up the cost of the scotch, meal, and uber to and from the steakhouse, and then I double it and put that extra amount (I would have spent on a dste) into my stock funds to make interest in the coming year). 

It's a stupid ritual I've done for the past 10 years or so. It just reminds me of how short-lived a valentines day celebration can be, and when I look at the rose that's drying on the mantle, I think of the money that is making me interest instead of just being gone. 

Sunday I'll be getting myself a nice young Korean whore in DC for a couple hours to enjoy, my dose of eros for the quarter.  

Then I'll kick back with some more ballentines on the rocks, and some good english tobacco from my grandfather's pipe, and enjoy picking my guitar on the back deck and watch the sun silhouette the hills before dipping behind them. 

Love yourself. Treat yourself, have a tasteful reminder of what you walked away from, and associate it with your increasing wealth as you do something for your own, pure enjoyment. 

That's what I'm doing on ballentines day weekend."

Even if they knew, there is no guarantees that they will speak against it in public. Because whatever these minority feminazis are doing are beneficial for vast majority of the woman. They might say this is a bad situation in a private conversation, that will definitely make them look like an innocent person. Since we rarely see woman speak up against modern feminism, we have to believe that they are content with all these. When woman were not content, they started feminism."

I call it ""red pill rabies"", where someone expresses hyperbolic anger against women, and others support him, actually validating the person's anger. It isn't healthy. MGTOW is a positive statement for individual ownership. ""MGTOW is freedom"" is so true. That's why I like this sub. Now go, my brother, live your life and don't worry about MGTOW1 anymore!"
1943,Fobilas,"Exactly.  I imagine most people feel very protective of themselves after a horrible breakup.  They become cynical of the opposite sex. It's not displaying strength. They did not adapt as well as others to a common tragedy in life.  In this way, the mgtow1 mentality is a mental health problem. 

I think mgtow1 is legit hate/anger though. It's like how I hated rich kids growing up because some of them were mean to poor kids.  Or how I hate cops because I've seen them haul off good people into cages. I am hurt, and I want to sooth my vulnerability with hate. When I say stuff like, ""Cops are bastards,"" I'm not in denial that I'm expressing anger and hatred. I am NOT being misunderstood. I am making **dehumanizing generalizations** about a large group of people, and people will condemn me for thar behavior deservingly.

Although perhaps I'm tone policing. If someone is right, it's ad hom to say, ""u mad, bro?"""
1944,Doctor_Red_Pill,I think mgtow1 is fine. It‚Äôs a good place to vent. Although I would change the name to ‚ÄúPost-roasties‚Äù because it‚Äôs obvious the people there are still holding on to some baggage from bad relationships.
1945,lonewolfhistory,I think TFM kinda expresses it best. MGTOW is a path or cycle that begins in unadulterated hate and rage. I think many in mgtow1 are just in that part of the cycle. I just wish there was a sub for every state of the path
1946,inconspeakuous,"Everyone's just a sex addict anymore, goes for both men and women. Very hard to find a good relationship with the opposite sex, friend or girlfriend.

Hookup culture has peaked, and imo that's a very sad thing."
1947,Bl00_Berry,As someone who was banned.... I agree
1948,inconspeakuous,"I try over and over and somehow I keep breaking. what pissed me off most was that I messaged a girl on Tinder and she really led me on, all the way up until I jerked off to one of her pics (I was 30 days clean on nofap). Turns out she's just a camgirl trying to get a new customer.

I felt so empty.

No more girls until I straighten out my own life."
1949,inconspeakuous,"Women get away with all of that because of the halo effect that they hide behind. It's really not 100% their fault if you ask me. It's men's faults for being sex addicts and letting women step all over them. If their man denies them anything, they threaten him with sexual rejection.

I think I read somewhere that 75% of women turn down 90% of men just so they can try to get the 'perfect' man, which is 10% of men. I forget the numbers, but they're ballpark.

Tinder is a perfect example of that. I read on a social experiment that average-looking women get more likes and matches than above-average looking men. I tried it myself and put a stock photo of a decent looking girl on a fake account (just one pic, no bio and no other info) and got over 100 likes in a day then deleted it. I believe I'm a good looking guy (not a 9 or 10/10 by any means) and I have racked up about 30 likes in a month.

And then it's even more heartbreaking when I'm around girls who are always talking about how there are no good men around anymore. It really hurts, and it makes me question myself. I wish I could tell them that, but it would just make me look worse.


And that's what brought me here. I'm not ashamed to say that I'm tired of hurt feelings. I'm just going to go my own way until I figure my life out, and maybe even cross paths with someone who isn't perfect, but at least respects my values (doesn't have to agree) and treats me like a human being.

They'd instead be on subreddits discussibg psychology or ethics or philosophy or current events or lit, just like everyone else that recognizes human flaws as universal and does not scapegoat one group of people.

. I don't need an incel like forum to express mgtow ideas. Dude I'm basically just against marriage, working slave jobs, and question how ofteb both partners actually *really really* want kids. Said right, that can be a topic for polite conversation anywhere!  It's not a conspiracy victimizing me.  It's social commentary. Everyone does it."
1953,fmanly,"> You would think they will understand female biology and learn to live with it.

> Mgtow1 is stuck in this never ending red pill rage.

/r/mgtow is a subreddit, not a person.  It doesn't learn anything.

Its individual contributors do.  They get past their rage, and then generally move on.  They might still participate on the sub, but with less of the rage-memes and so on.

However, every day thousands of new men are born into the world, and trained to be bluepilled.  Eventually many will become redpilled and will enter the rage phase.  Then they join /r/mgtow and many other subs.

There will always be more new MGTOW than experienced ones, because MGTOW is a growing group.  

You might feel like you're speaking into the void when you try to help them, but you're not.  You actually are helping people.  It is just that the people you help are quickly replaced by 100 others who still need your help.  You'll never be done if your goal is to redpill the world.  

Just be at peace with it.  Accept that there will always be a ton of new MGTOW who are raging.  Help those you're willing to help.  Realize you can't help them all, but most will eventually figure it out.

And of course people will judge MGTOW by the vocal ragers.  Who cares..."
1954,MyLittlePonyofDoom,"> where someone expresses hyperbolic anger against women, and others support him, actually validating the person's anger.

You're not going to be all smiles after breakups, a divorce and such of course you're going to see through the lines and such but does that really mean they're anti-woman? 

As I said before :
Calling women on their shit = / = women hating .

Usually what happens with pictures like this is you end up with low-effort comments, and a bunch of ""hur-dur wahmens"" comments start popping up which makes more work for the mod team.

I got banned with this account on the original MGTOW, not sure what for, but probably because I got annoyed and had a pretty unpleasant reply on someone's post.  Not that, that matters to me, I just wasn't able to reply on this account anymore.

MGTOW has unfortunately always been seemingly dominated by boneheaded right wing Americans with little political education beyond a single fetid corporate news source. They're all for displaying their superior alpha masculinity for having 'moved off the plantation"" but point out out that right wing politics is nothing more than obedience to authoritarian institutions, debt servitude and flag waving group think etc and the hive pile on. They can't handle it.

And now out-and-out fascist sympathizers are welcomed to the fold. I guess that's no surprise given the amount of 'white genocide' retards that lurk there.

Looking at the rules for this sub and noticing one of them explicitly states ""no racist/nazi shit"" suggests it's quite a problem in certain MGTOW circles."

2053,MetaCognitio,"Not quite r/mgtow but got banned from /r/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen for responding to this post:

> Is having daughters the ultimate cuckoldry?

> I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.

> Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.

> As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically


That post is freaking weird and creepy. My response:


> This is some weird creepy pedo shit. What are you going to do? Have sex with her yourself. As long as she makes you proud and does great in life, who really cares? Yeah she is gonna have sex, as long as she respects herself, who cares? Would it bother you if she waited till marriage too? Or is the thought of your daughter ever having a boyfriend/husband to difficult for you.

> For me, as long as she does not turn out to be a loser, being passed around by a bunch of losers, marries a great guy and does well in life, it is not too much of my business.

> This obsessing over your child's vagina is weird and creepy.

Sounds like the dude wants to ravage his daughter or is bothered about her ever having sex, even if it is her husband. Anyone that talks about his daughter's 'tight pussy' has some serious issues. That post is weird beyond belief."
2054,,"not banned but I realized how toxic and hateful a lot of the dudes there are, people suck, sadly sometimes people you date or marry are shit, and if you decide to focus on yourself I'm all for that

the difference being actually 'going your own way', not posting about how trash women were to you every day and living in an echo chamber

That hating shows that you care, that hating gives power to the other person to use against you. Then I got banned. At least, that's what I think it was for. I am waiting for them to tell me what I did wrong.

[Edit] I actually told them that I didn't care why I was banned. Then I un-joined. They don't seem to be able to tolerate different points of view. I guess they're just like woke SJWs that get triggered easily."

2098,Factor13th,"I am about to just leave mgtow1because guys there act like they cuckedtow. They believe you an mra because you simply make the piint that a lazy mgtow that just watches the world burn.. Is just as bad as a femnist.

2099,thoughtOG83,"What I do not understand is why so many MGTOW's mock women for having cats, when so many MGTOW's post pictures of themselves with dogs.

And hating women is just nonsensical.

One can be wary of them, yes.

But to hate women is to hate life, especially if ostensibly you're a heterosexual.

I wasn't banned, but I could tell that it was very echo chamber- esque.

MGTOW was originally about protecting oneself during a divorce.

They have posts with FGTOW's (fakes going their own way) decrying their own sisters, like they are going to be accused of incest or something.

That shit be weird."

I have been permanently banned from r/MGTOW for no reason and without any explanation. The one place where you could talk like a free man and add value without the fear of someone shutting you down. Or so I thought. The mods have chosen to hide behind their screens and not respond after repeated requests to give a reason. I went back and saw my activity to see what might've triggered the ban although I've not violated a single rule. I might've answered questions meant for ladies in some other subs and interacted with different kinds of people, none of which is a reason to ban. Why I'm so disappointed with this particular ban is that MGTOW is a good forum for men to develop self-respect and develop their personalities independent of their SMV, to rid themselves of societal baggage. This ban has thrown all that to the dogs and made me question if a good part of its members are really cucks who just want to have the feminazi experience because they are deprived of it elsewhere...

I can post any of the links from my comment here if anyone wants.

I PMed them to ask why they had banned me, but I didn't get a response. My personal theory is that whilst the /r/MGTOW mods are likely not particularly homophobic themselves, perhaps they are being 'sponsored' in some way by far-right elements who very much are."

Because the guy with ""mgtow"" flair really gave off extremely strong /r/mgtow vibes and he made ""meme"" remarks entirely unrelated to the topic at hand.

2159,IntellegoTheTrue1,A reset is natural after a while. They banned me for a line of sarcasm while they don't ban blatant feminist supporters. What a shame what MGTOW has become after all the love and dedication I gave to that sub. I feel betrayed at best.

2178,Justlivinhere,I just got banned for making a post on why woman cant support mgtow. Im fairly new to reddit so the terms incel and mgtow are new to me and i was guinenly curious why they wont allow woman. I thought it was a great idea as i wanted to introduce a kid of friends of mine to that sub because he really dont have much hobbys and i hoped that sub could support him in finding his own way. But damn those man are full of hate and full of themselves and not about going their own way.
2179,TigPlaze,I may be banned at mgtow 1.  I make posts there and they never show up.  WTF?  They're totally on topic posts without any flaming of anyone.

I had got out most of my redpill rage, so I guess they sent me on my way"
2185,,"So wow, I can't believe I just got banned from r/MGTOW. I thought I was one of their brothers. I loved the content that was posted. I didn't see it as hateful at all. I saw it as frustrated and hurt red pilled men who needed to vent. All was well until I notice some of my comments were getting no activity, so I made this post.

>I have been suspicious of any posts or comments I make that have no activity, so I asked one of the members to try to look at any of my posts or comments that stay at 1 karma. More and more recently, my comments are missing and my posts are removed without explanation. When I attempt to contact mods, I get ignored. Mods, if you have a problem with me, talk to me. Don't ignore me. If you are overwhelmed with mod stuff, get more mods to help. It's really irritating to try to participate in a sub when my stuff gets randomly removed for no reason.

When that post was deleted, I pressed the mods for an explanation and I got banned. If they really don't want to deal with people or the stress of moderating a sub, they should step down as mods. Just removing submissions and comments without explanation is an unacceptable way to run a forum regardless of the subject of the forum."

2190,Buckeye44302,Not sure why I got banned.  It was a thread where guys were being keyboard warriors and really ripping on women.  Didn't defend the women so much as tried to get them to see a bit of perspective.  Always thought going your own way meant not caring what women said or did and you just focus on doing things you want to do.

Even though said rule isnt listed on the community page at all but can be found if you attempt to message the mods.  I think they do that for plausible deniability.

While reading their rules the hypocrisy is kind of stunning.  The whole philosophy is about freedom yet enforcing those rules means that people with a different opinion on social issues wont be able to post there.  \*Confused Jackie Chan\*"

You should have taken the lead a LONG, long time ago instead of letting wifey turn your daughters into young cum-guzzling fucktoy mercenaries that bring ruin to our society. She's a fucktoy now, you can't remove the many, many gangsta-ass dicks she's ridden from her soul, and she's eternally pairbound to some random piece of shit thug life asshole.

One side is the MGTOW sub reddit that have been infested with cuck mods who will ban you for anything that's not against the rules cuz of feefees.


And the other side is this sub that want to ignore female nature and hypergamy by overloading the sub with other subjects....as if they you to forget the main catalyst for why men went MGTOW in the first place.

2292,n00bRECON_BR,"I can agree with that there are many FGTOW, but the mocking over woman with cats is just a stereotype kind of joke (i guess), it means that woman with cats are so desesperated for atention cuz they cant get laid (or something like that) so they use that stereotype to use as an argument. MGTOW posts pictures of them with dogs cuz it is popular belif that dogs are the most loyal living creature to a man.

2327,FlintAustin,"I been banned like 5 times.

I had created a few accounts down the road to keep my daily red pills since I don't use Reddit for much else.

However, this time around I am pretty sure being in a mgtow sub where you feel like walking on eggshells like a relationship with a woman is last thing I want.

Fuck them."
2328,FlintAustin,"Yup you are not alone man. As you clearly see here lol.

There has been something fishy since last year. I was shadow banned for about 2 weeks. Then I was banned for 'low effort' post and unbanned once I wrote them about 5-6 times.

Again banned again lol.

I think they are too concerned about not being perceived a certain way.

Basically bashing females is encouraged and seems to be a hard lean on male-victim narrative. More like a systematic way to impress young minds but censor experienced men who see the grey than just black and white."

2332,Solid_Gold_Turd,Unbanned? Does such a thing even happen over there?
2333,Impossible-asset,"Correct, because people havent stopped being banned from there without any reason. And they still post here in the main forum, which then gets clogged with posts on the subject. So that's why there is another thread."

2364,MetaCognitio,I was the one that got banned for calling him out!
2365,MelodicBrush,"That's my point. Exactly the same happened to me. I only said that my gf seems to be an exception. Boom ban. They want to make the sub into a hate sub an nothing else, so that they can discredit MGTOW as just being men that want all women dead or something."
2366,GoatKnows,"Well I will say this when there is over a 90% chance you will interact with a womanbin some form and you demand that there is 100% no reason to talk about it as though it doesn't exist you are setting men up to fail. Because your mail, your Uber driver, your public transportation ride, & much more will include women. And all it takes is one slip up to arm her with the key to destroying you"
2367,the_milk_is_back,"I get that. But to be MGTOW is to acknowledge certain things regarding society and women. But to dwell on it is simply NOT going one's own way. And to be so rigid in judging people is just a miserable way to live life.

In my experience the padawans like posts such as ""look at this post-wall thot looking for a simp orbiter beta provider"".

The masters like ""I'm learning to truly enjoy life being single and here's this car I'm restoring"" or ""me and my friend on the lake at sunrise going fishing""

The rage stage is real, but life is so much better when you leave it behind."
2368,haagendaas,Yeah one of those guys called me a ‚Äúfake MGTOW‚Äù all because I ‚Äúonly‚Äù refused to do hookups and came into relationships cautiously because I knew the dangers
2369,GoatKnows,"My brother to me I understand if it's hate speach their will be threats of violence but the truth is MGTOW & GYOW is about avoiding women & staying in your goal. And to avoid reminding men about a danger that is in their instinct to come help that's only a trap. For example a woman & her kids are stuck on the road, & a man helps without knowing that he set himself up for the woman to lie that he tried to rape her in front of her kids, just so she can get attention. MGTOW needs to keep that fear of contact with the modern American women who for attention will not only weaponize herself but her bastard children. We men already know how to deal with one another it's that danger of wanting to be honorable & helpful that women prey on & it's something we have to fight against every moment. Oh a women can't lift her package tried to help accused of stealing, oh a woman bumped into a you she fell you tried to help claims you touched her inappropriately. 

Yes by being MGTOW & GYOW we declared victory & freedom, but our guard must stay up as all times not against women but our own nature that will lead us to helping them."
2370,passsingstrange,They are angreerrry
2371,kayfab,"Yeah this is kind of weird, this is why i never follow religion nor politics."
2372,AlanTheGr8,People should be free to pro anti trump everywhere and not banbed for it unless its trolling etc. Free speach isbunkown to most of reddit and trp is quarantined but incest and dogsex subs r not..insanity
2373,kayfab,completely stupid ban and unbanned what ever happen to freedom of speech now there are a zillion rules to follow or you get banned before posting.....
2374,kayfab,Sorry to offend you fatty
2375,Svartanatten,It's all socialism?
2376,AlanTheGr8,"I swear that MensRights and MGTOW are stealth channels that is  are psyops. There are lots of silly mods there,  that may or not be women, and the goal may be to give the appearance of free speach while shadow banning all posts that hit close to home or are too dangerous and truthful.

&#x200B;

It would be too obvious to outright ban ALL male speach so it gives them plausable deniablility and cover.

&#x200B;

Also many of the mods may be easily triggered, have a bad life, general mean trolls, etc.

&#x200B;

I think a lot of reddit, like IRC, and early internet, people camped out or bought names of channels/domains so that they could control them.

&#x200B;

For instance it wouldn't surprise me at all if a Woman  were to start a channel called MGTOW to monitor and control all thought that goes through there.

&#x200B;

Heck, men could run some feminist channels. Wouldn't that be funny. Laff"

2379,tegs98,Yeah
2380,DiccDucc,"Right. I commented on a post in where a couple were both acting like children, and was neither on the man's side, or the woman's side. I wrote about how both of them were immature, and how neither should be in a relationship before they mature a little bit more.   


Then I got called an anti-male cuck (for calling both people in the couple assholes) and banned. 

&#x200B;

Yikes."
2381,gielrebel,didn't catch your drift here mate.
2382,veronikuh,That‚Äôs exactly what I said! It is the same goal! Feminism allowed me to define myself apart from my relationship to men. And MGTOW allows men to define themselves apart from their relationship to women. I think it‚Äôs awesome for everyone to do that. And I‚Äôm glad this group aims to do that without conflating it with viewing women as the enemy. Cheers. Solidarity brothers.
2383,Ferg_NZ,">How they determine that someone is a concern troll is beyond me

I agree.  I think ""concern trolling"" is a bullshit way of deflecting from an issue.  Concern trolling doesn't exist outside of reddit."
2384,Factor13th,Seems like they most have lol Mgtow doesnt need a leader they all gotta learn to stand on their own two feet and learn to fight.. No point in bitching if they wont do anything about it.
2385,Factor13th,"To be honest I wouldnt give a shit. I am always honest and wont be shut up whether people, ban, kick, beat me up, or kill me. No point in complaining and not doing anything.

While feminist and betas kep destroying our lives in society."
2386,Factor13th,I got banned for making points on why it's a movement and for disrespecting someone who was acting stupid with me lol
2387,AlanTheGr8,Not all
2388,pwandapop,How? They banned me for saying something they didn‚Äôt like and I think that‚Äôs toxic and shouldn‚Äôt be encouraged.
2389,pwandapop,I got banned for saying you shouldn‚Äôt say all women are sick fucks
2390,krugerand9,i suspect a feminist has covertly broken into the mods club over there.
2391,IntellegoTheTrue1,He must be the same incel he swore to kick off r/MGTOW. Ugh
2392,The-Deviant-One,"Same. Been active and in good standing for a very long time. Banned, no warning, no response."

2394,ZombiNawhal,"Bingo! Part of me wonders if they have a secret idealog Moderator that they don't know about? How could they be so wilfully closed minded?

It boggles the mind."
2395,Untowardopinions,Jfc the persecution complex.  Literally ALL OF REDDIT is men talking to men about their hobbies.  You just also want to drop in ‚Äúand women fucking suck‚Äù somewhere you won‚Äôt get called an incel for it.
2396,cmdralpha,That exactly what happened to me just unsubscribe cause there is no point anymore
2397,double-happiness,"Well, what's your explanation then? Why are they being so censorious when that's so much against MGTOW philosophy?"
2398,AlanTheGr8,"Why? What is the preffered word for homosexual these days? Ppl get so butthurt and keep changing the preferred words... Unless the intent is bad the word isnt bad. Black, colored, gay, whatever.

They hate themselves so they ban u. Same with that story of woman who bans if u say female.

Its a crazy world of everyonevis king of their microbubble. Oh king! Ban! Im a queen! Ban! Dont assume my gender! They are just looking to make others miserable.

And it spills into the real world... It was busy at the gas station pumps and i waited and i finally started pulling into one and someone else who had just got their literally went ape shit and cursing me late 40s asshat acting like 5yr old.

So Im like u want 2 fight bro? And hea like yeah get out of ur car! So I start 2 video him and he fled... What a mighty wuss crybaby. 

The mods are like him x10 -20, years"
2399,BeckyLynchIsBetter,"I think it's stupid, but okay. Thanks for letting me know, btw."

 Isnt that obvious to you? 

Guess not because you have a woman's brain."
2404,,"Seriously, it's almost like they are trying to give the movement a bad name and get it banned from Reddit. I can't say I blame the rest of the world for assuming we're just a bunch of bitter incels when the men who are supposedly ""going their own way"" literally just obsessively talk about women and nothing else."
2405,IntellegoTheTrue1,"Learning how to deal with people the best way possible is not niceism or blue pilled attitude, it's just a tool to save yourself from mental stress and useless conflict. Lately I learned the value of it, I think it should be a staple of MGTOW to learn how to deal with people. Monk mode is just toxic and bad for self improvement, even if you have s job that doesn't require interaction much"
2406,DangZagnut,"I can't, /u/Impossible-asset banned me.  You don't see me posting do you?

It still doesn't answer the question why there isn't a ""banned from MGTOW2 mega thread""."

2408,DespawnMe,Lol okie dokie
2409,Drayelya,"That is not the point of the ideology of MGTOW. MGTOW advocates for men deciding what way they want to go, even if that way isn‚Äôt in line with how other MGTOW think. The point is to offer/receive advice but, not to force your own personal idea of what MGTOW is down another man‚Äôs throat. This is why a lot of the monks have left the main MGTOW sub or even got banned for ridiculing how it‚Äôs members act."
2410,wathon2,"this.   Freedom of speech for me but not for thee. 

Sounds familiar,  sounds like feminism.   No wonder people equate MGTOW to feminism.  

The MODS over at MGTOW (if they are reading this comment) need to get their heads out of their asses and take a long look in the mirror."
2411,nla6219,"Im far from liberal, i oppose almost everything modern day liberals/leftists stand for. That being said and even being a Theocratic Distributist personally I believe in free speech for all whether i agree with you or not. The only laws that are legit are the original amendments in the U.S. constitution. Everything else has no validity. Any laws or policies that say you have no right to speech, privacy or armaments are unconstitutional, invalid and must be fought against.

I'm not sure if you watch TFM by chance, but he's addressed the topic before. Going your way isn't just about relationships, but a path to self actualization without the need for external validation. Gay men and bi men absolutely can be MGTOW."
2416,Fylix_Aerou,"Sorry for the second post, but I did want to show an example of something good I found from the subreddit.

2417,poopiedoodie710,Closest I‚Äôve found to any sort of positive space for men has been r/menslib. Admittedly I‚Äôm kinda leery about this sub but I‚Äôll give it a chance; r/MGTOW has some warped individuals on there lol
2418,MuleFool42,"Exactly. Men need to share stories, collaborate, and support each other. That's what it should be, instead it's a cesspool over there. This is a much better sub."
2419,GTOH4U,"Yep, that's where it's going. Just an incel woman hating jerk circle rather that a positive group where people discussed what path they were taking and how to do it etc."
2420,,"this exactly. 

Westerners have been so brainwashed by the 6 million lie it is utterly ridiculous to have an educated discussion about this.

I have seen the information you are talking about and the 6 million figure was lauded by jewish press going back into the 1800s for a number of events."
2421,DyingSociety,I like to think that most individuals are sane in mgtow but this screams mental health issues. Maybe I shouldn't associate myself with these people considering what the mod did...
2422,weasted_,Mb rip bro
2423,simplisticallysimple,"No doubt, but we all already know that. Like I said, there's a time and place for everything. And I hope this place wouldn't become a place for that. Men seem to have trouble discussing women ""dispassionately"" because most have been burned bad and can't shake off that bitterness. In the end, it devolves into women-bashing all over again, like r/MGTOW."

2428,alamsohel1990,true way to go
2429,cursed_deity,i don't think so because the first time got banned was because i gave the tip to not hate women but to simply ignore them and focus on bettering yourself
2430,IntellegoTheTrue1,Yeah that sounds like a reasonable thing
2431,cursed_deity,"come on, lets not use incel as an insult. 

we should be better as that"
2432,T0000009,"you can tell it's subversion of some kind, look at what get's posted now and the quality of the comments."
2433,FlintAustin,"Yup. I am pretty sure there is a woman somewhere there.

Some faggot admin found his way in but left his balls behind."
2434,FlintAustin,"The whole point for mgtow is men doing their thing and speaking their mind.

Some men will always have some reservations toward liking or disliking women that swings on extreme ends. But they have a very narrow approach.

Kind of good to be banned. Was being too pessimistic."
2435,Loban8990,I already have. Ive been a member of that sub from my other account since 2014 and a year on this one. Ive always followed thier rules so it is annoying to just be kicked out with no explanation. But whatever I unsubbed from there with both accounts.
2436,,Cause you sound like a dumb liberal fag to the mods in your comment thats explanation enough
2437,unblackmailable,"Maybe it's more simple than that.  Let me kick in an open door.  I don't think they ban you because they hate themselves, I think they ban just because they can.  What I believe at this point is, that one must present themselves as more than virtuous or you get cannibalised by your own kind, e.g. not red enough for a communist, not green enough for an environmentalist ... it's all very political in a sense that politics have become the new religion.  The Spanish inquisition didn't only burn demons, they got innocent people to."
2438,vHohenheim23,"It is stupid. You should be allowed to say whatever you want, exactly because it is a public domain. It's called freedom of speech/expression etc. 

So I guess the main question should be. Is reddit a platform(does not censor as they won't be forced to take responsibility for content made on their platform) or a publisher(a bunch of illiterates that censor opposition)...? Which one is it? 

It's even more disconcerting when the interpretation of ""racism/nazism"", ""women-hating"" etc gets left to a  bunch of overly sensitive man-children. 

What offends them, might not offend you or me. What they deem ""hatred"" might not be hatred at all. They just don't like the message, so they delete it and ban the user to silence any opposing opinions. 

Are homosexuals equal to the rest of us, or are they a protected class to the point where you'll get banned just for calling someone gay? Because that is what the latter looks like, that's then not ""equality"" like they bark the whole day, it's enforcing a ""protected class"". That's something entirely different, but that is the type of nonsense you get left with when a bunch of fruitcakes get to decide the ""rules"" everyone should ""abide"" at instead of leaving everyone to discuss issues, regardless of how ""offensive"" it is; like any supposed-to-be civilized nation."
2439,unblackmailable,"you're right.  I was thinking about a sword of Damocles that hangs over one's head when saying something slighty off, when I wrote it.  It came across totally differently.  But calling it stupid might not be correct either.  If it's stupid but it prevents a negative result...it's just ignorance."
2440,kittynovalove,You‚Äôre proving my point
2441,FlintAustin,"Monk mode is toxic? Not sure what interaction with others plays a factor here.

What is toxic is this notion of self-improvement masquerading some serious underlying desire to feel validated from others.

A monk has achieved far greater self-improvement living amidst the constant chaos."
2442,Pliyii,Because there isn't. There question answered. No need to get philosophical about it.
2443,WolverineDLogan,The moderating team must be full of those damn incels.
2444,ausgamer529,"My way is the only way I'm going from now on. I tried my best with women for years and it was height and looking too young that made relationships impossible with them. Now that I have a man in my life who loves me it is like a huge weight lifted from me.

2445,Azuzu88,"For a while I noticed quite a few guys speaking up about how the self-improvement posts had died out and all of the posts were about hating women, but they eventually dried up."
2446,MetaCognitio,"I stay on the fringes to be honest. I listen to what some of the youtubers and posters have to say, but the deeper parts of the MGTOW community have some really screwed up people (and some that aren't obviously). Some of these guys literally HATE women.

The fact that I got banned, the post has 34 upvotes and the guy has a daughter really bothers me. At least some of the replies are better. Although one spoke about that being the reason why there are selective abortions in India so they can have male children ü§Æ"

2458,Ferg_NZ,You raise a good point.  If you are not extreme then you are treated as some sort of mutant.  There is nothing wrong with having empathy for other positions.
2459,Impossible-asset,"Context is important here. 

If you show up and start making posts about ""this is gay, that is gay, I might go eat some hay I can make things out of clay, and lay by the bay, I just may, whaddya say?""  Well, then your post would get removed and the mods would tell you at least what rule of the sub you were breaking. 

It you persist at it and constantly become a nuisance, then you should be shadow banned or temporarily banned. But you have to try pretty hard for that to happen here. 

As for freedom ot speech. Well, yes and no. We do want to encourage people to discuss things here, as long as it falls within the direction and purpose of the sub. And that is basically one that mgtow is a healthy life philosophy for men. 

Its not a place just bash on women or complain about access to or lack thereof of sex. It's for men who are walking a mgtow journey and want to talk with others who are doing the same, and offer advice or answer questions for men who would like to and have questions about it.  On topic discussion. 

If we just said ""hey it's a free speech bastion"" we'd end up with a meme-littered negativity fest and before long the sub would get shut down. 

So yes, the sub is moderated to keep the level of discussion elevated, for the benefit of all the subscribers. I hope that helps explain things a bit."
2460,Frelsi_8899,"I agree with everything you said, unfortunately, there's no fixing it. 

And it doesn't stop there. There's a mod on /r/infidelity that bans post just at the sheer mention of pronouns she deems unfit. Eg: Female. Until that sub I had no idea that some people consider the word female an insult. I just use it as a synonym for women. 

Same like I call women, birds, chicks, chicas, for the last few decades no one ever took offense. 

Problem is 1 foul moron, who's actually in charge of a pretty serious sub, which is the first sub people go to looking for information and support for infidelity, a VERY serious subject matter, are at the whim of some feminist with the emotional EQ of a 5-year-old and the mannerisms and maturity of a stubborn 19 year old. 

At no point do these people step back and just let the users of these subs get on with what they want. 

And does their policing really help? Well, no one likes to be policed. But if it hits the point where it's no fun anymore, or simply broken, that's when subs lose traction, and when that happens Reddit loses traction."
2461,IntellegoTheTrue1,If you monk till the point you can't talk and interact with people with some sort of self awareness there is no MGTOW group where you don't risk to be kicked out from. MGTOW is not about solipsism.

It is always best policy to be up front with your boundaries.

Those who disagree covertly, i.e. accept up front, but ""change their mind"" later,  
You can always go firmly back you having been already up front with her so you have yourself covered.

Thus as a gentleman and if you are interested it would have been  nice thing to do. In todays society there is alot of femists but keep in mind not everyone is and I dont think should change the way you approach women. Maybe she did back out because she wanted a free meal or maybe she didnt. Women are wired different than us. Maybe she just took it a little offensive. Either way, you shoot your shot with your women if you cant do an inexpensive meal after you were the one that asked her out. Than maybe you should wait till a girl asks you out. I dont mean anything in a bad way. A single meal wont kill you if its a girl that really interests you."

2535,hundakuten,Are you sure you're not looking for a PUA forum?
2536,Blexit2020,">She's just some woman with traditional values...

Exactly. I keep trying to tell some of y'all that you're gonna mess around and shoot yourselves in the foot because you're pushing away good women with Conservative, traditional values; likely women who have some kind of religious upbringing. Generally, not all, but *generally,* these types of women are anti-feminist and embrace their roles as women which is to be a help -meet to their husbands. I honestly don't know what else to say anymore, because it's not dissimilar from what feminists do to men and then complain about there ""not being any good men left."" Well, it's because all of the ""good men"" you want have traditional values, and your emasculating BS is a complete turn off to them. So, they walk away from or avoid you completely. 

It's the same with MGTOW/red pill men who are still dating for whatever reason. If you try to pull that ""true equality"" mess on a woman with traditional values, she's going to be turned off. That means, you just pushed away a woman that likely believes in submitting to her husband, the man being the head of the household, home cooked meals, washing your drawls, and keeping the marriage bed undefiled and satisfactory, and you being [the king of the castle](https://youtu.be/_e1Hw39C7lE). These women are also usually raised that approaching men is forward and unladylike, so the *only* way you can encounter her is if you do the courting. A woman that is ok with ""going dutch,"" NSA sex, hanging out in bars drinking and carrying on, is likely a feminist! The very type of person a lot of MGTOW men say they're actively trying to avoid. It's like they want a woman with traditional values, but feminist behaviors. It don't work that way, pimpin' lol. You either get a lady with traditional values whom you have to present with equally traditional values or you get a feminist. Those are your options if you choose to date instead of going monk. 

There are a lot of good men and women out there who want to love and connect with someone and start a family. And feminists and MGTOW cats are gonna mess around and push good candidates away because they're trying so hard to ""beat the system"" and prove a point. Once you've gotten to a point where you're actively blocking your own blessings, it is *then* that you've become a slave to the system. I've seen this happen in person. This girl got mad because this guy who was interested in her opened the door for her. This guy's a complete gentleman and a darn good catch. He has very traditional values and will make an excellent husband and father some day. And this heifer had the nerve to get mad because he opened doors for her? She sure didn't get mad when he was paying for her meals and driving up his gas getting her to work every day, though. If I sound irritated, I am, because this is my little brother I'm talking about, and I didn't appreciate the way this girl did him at **all.**

Traditional values don't mix with feminism and MGTOW. So if you want to date and adhere to MGTOW, you're going to be relegated to the feminists you hate, because a woman with traditional values will be put off by you. Period."
2537,Ridewithme38,"Its not so much a game he's playing as he has a type. Just like you may not want to date a fat girl, he does not want to date a girl who doesnt contribute equally."
2538,KhajiitFL,"FYI: PUA != MGTOW

2539,Thotsithinknots,Np yea. You are correct. I've had 10s pay insist on paying their way. You stuck to your guns. Respect. I'm the same way. Draw that hard line.
2540,Amphibole_,"Just because he isn't completely ignorant to the dating scene doesn't mean he's involving himself in it. 

Did you know that some people go MGTOW as a response from learning red pill theory, opposed to just blindly going along without understanding the social dynamics relating to it?"
2541,Amphibole_,"You make a good point, but I think it's too easy to say traditional = good, equality = bad. 

I mean the above is 'probably' true if you want a long term relationship like your brother, but the reverse is true for men who don't want one, and are just interested in the short term right?

And the OP rejected someone for holding traditional values, indicating he just wanted someone for the short term. 

I would argue that short term isn't worth it, especially given the type of people who want equality, as you said. But the same goes for long term. Just because they're traditional, doesn't mean it's a good deal, nor does it mean they're any different from most other women at heart (AWALT). It's up to each individual (who dates) to decide which they want, and if they go for the reverse, what more can they expect than to get hurt.

&#x200B;

I suppose there are also women who take this traditional perspective of wanting to be paid for, and then acting in every way non-conservative. I think that's the reason for the OP to make this thread. He's trying to warn us of women who kinda chameleon traditionalism to exploit mens' wallets?

 

But again, the OP indicated to the woman he wants something short term (equal pay), and she rejected on terms that either (1) she doesn't want short term, or (2) she's chameleoning traditionalism for a free meal.

So, is he warning us of (1) or (2)... well he never found out which one she was, so it's all too likely she's simply traditional. Leaving me to ask, why did he make this thread and why is everyone pretending there is a lesson to be learnt from his story?"
2542,,"Men paying for dates ended when women largely entered the workforce in ww1 and ww2. Now, there is no reason for not go half on dates."
2543,Amphibole_,"When I said he's playing a game, I was referring to him trying to go on dates with women. All that 'nonsense', it is all just part of what women are, and these things repel MGTOW individuals. 

&#x200B;

But if the OP wants to date that's fine and it's on him. He can want a relationship with someone who pays for themself. But it goes both ways. She can also want someone who pays for her. 

The difference is he wants equality, and she doesn't. But if you want a sustainable relationship, equality is irrelevant, as attraction is asymmetrical. Again, it's up to him but just don't complain about what you're choosing to engage in."
2544,Amphibole_,"What did I say that makes you think so, and why? I'm a MGTOW who never dates or anything of the like, nor do I intend to ever in the future.

I'm arguing that the dating scene is asymmetrical for biological reasons, and if people choose to date, this is something that they must accept. Personally, this would be a downside to dating but as a MGTOW, I don't date so idgaf and idk who in this sub would care."
2545,Thotsithinknots,I would even tell her she should be ashamed of herself its 2019!
2546,bunnytron,"Usually when the girl insists on paying for herself, it means she is not interested and has friend-zoned. But I also know of many exceptions where if the man is unemployed/underemployed or they‚Äôre college-aged that going Dutch is common practice"
2547,hundakuten,"Man, you make me cringe so hard"
2548,Blexit2020,"I was being very general when I said good men/women have traditional values. Obviously, people are individuals and should be judged by their character. I wasn't so much stating that people with traditional values are usually ""good people to be in relationships with"" as I was stating that people who are good candidates for relationships usually have traditional values. Does that make sense?

All in all, I, too, am unsure what the exact message OP is trying to convey, here. To draw parallels with feminists again, it's like complaining that there are men out there who have the ""nerve and audacity"" to expect a woman to be more submissive, feminine, and allow him to lead. It just sounds like a typical situation of encountering someone who doesn't share your values and with whom you're incompatible. That's...*normal.* There's nothing wrong with having traditional values, and if one doesn't want to adhere to traditional values, they have every right to look elsewhere. But there's no reason to ring the proverbial alarm and ""warn"" others that people with traditional values exist. Even if the intent was to imply the ""chameleon theory"" it's still unnecessary. That's like saying, ""Beware of ""smiling faces."" Sometimes people are nice to others just to get what they want out of them."" Naw, really, lol?

>Just because they're traditional, doesn't mean it's a good deal, nor does it mean they're any different from most other women at heart (AWALT). 

That's very true. But it is a good temperature gauge, for sure.

Maybe it's because I'm a socially awkward weirdo, but I'll never understand why so many people who claim to be tired of being generalized by certain groups then proceed to generalize others themselves. Literally every demographic does this ad nauseam; *especially* these past few years. I swear, depending on the subject matter, every online discussion involves some variation of the following:

White people always...

Black people always...

Conservatives always...

Liberals always...

Immigrants always...

[Insert religious group here] always...

Men always...

Women always...

Do you ever think that we'll get to a point in society where we start judging people based upon *who* they are instead of *what* they are? The fact that humans are even managing to coexist anymore with this type of thinking being so widespread is nothing short of a miracle. I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop, because it's like everyone is just sick of everyone now, lol."

2552,Amphibole_,"Uh-huh, that's right. 

Both your posts are aggressive with no argumentative value. 

I'd ask why you're even here but looking at the quality of your speech, I'm scared that you'll call me a poo poo head or something..."
2553,Amphibole_,"Honestly, I haven't really noticed much generalising of groups directly. I mean there is a strong media agenda against straight white males in games and movies and all that, but it's a bit specific..

I'm trying to think of what it's most similar to and I just come up with the general dislike of people who are in a different category to yourself, or really just people who have different opinions.

But at the same time, the internet makes it so much easier to avoid it and only speaking to people who hold the same opinions. Take MGTOW for example, even with a heavy social rejection of MGTOW, it's easy to find this sub.

This leads me to the next point, that even within the groups there may be differences in opinion. But a ridiculous proportion of society are ignorant in many ways. They don't look to correct fallacies in their arguments, or find problems with their behaviour to improve. 

What I'm getting to is that most people who dislike people for having different opinions, are also almost always going to confide in their own group, where they will choose to avoid discussions of any disagreements. This provides them with a safe place, so they won't have a strong need to leave their group to attack others (too frequently). For this I don't think there will be any major repercussions on a societal level. 

Having said this, it feels like the topic is too vague for my answer to hold any meaning. but at the same time, I'm thinking that there can't just be a reason for society to crumble, but there must also be a sufficient driving force. Enough people have to respond in a particular way, and I don't see this happening."
