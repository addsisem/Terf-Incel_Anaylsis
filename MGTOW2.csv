With women, you need petitions with hundreds of thousands of signers, 500 articles, witnesses, sworn testimony, lawyers, and then, maybe, is the target minorly slapped on the wrist."
1,OMG that is amazing news.  A win for sanity.  Thank fuck.
2,"""Amber Heard has no confirmed films after Aquaman 2 and **may need to create an OnlyFans account** to pay back Johnny Depp if he wins his defamation case against her since she’s reportedly only worth USD$9 million.""   
    
Hahaha!  

Source article - https://www.sausageroll.com.au/entertainment/movies/amber-heard-to-be-fired-from-aquaman-2-and-other-hollywood-movies/"
3,Pretty sure it’s an April fools joke.
4,"it will be better served if she pays for the defamation losses he endured, but happy news nevertheless :)"
5,"She had it coming, tried to destroy one of Hollywood's greats but he was one step ahead of her! Also it's sad bc she's not being completely blacklisted in Hollywood and even though its public knowledge that she is an abuser and a liar another actor or male with influence will date her no problem bc she's a beautiful woman."
6,Hopefully this is true finally!! justice will be served!
7,"We're only half-way there. Vote with your dollars! When the films start failing, then she will be left working the midnight shift at the stop and rob."
8,Who is she and why?
9,We did it boys
10,Interesting. Someone alert Sydney Watson she literally just uploaded a video the other day discussing this situation and how it was basically swept under the rug.
11,never heard of her
12,"It is about time, but is the court case with Johnny Depp still ongoing?"
13,"She's also hit the Wall. Heard first. Karma, most certainly is a bitch...."
14,Good news afterall.
15,she got that Elon money. Saul Goodman.
16,As an Aquaman fan if this actually happens then I'd like to see Aqualad come into the franchise.
17,Yay. Feeling blessed. This has totally changed my life.
18,Would be kinda funny if they did a remake of the Honeymooners. Imagine seeing Depp and Amber as Ralph and Alice. To the moon Alice!
19,Fucking bitch needs to be put in solitary confinement for the rest of time.
20,She's also bisexual. Imagine that.
21,So that petition on change.org did come in handy after all.
22,Hurrah!  This is such great news.  No one has ever deserved to be fired more than this bitch.
23,Justice? She should be in jail
24,If this was a man it would have been instantaneous. No evidence would be needed to fire him. Instead it took evidence along with major pressure from fans and movie goers to have this bitch bounced.
25,Take note ladies. Your gravy train is skidding off the rails.
26,I'm waiting silently. I won't believe in justice till I see it. Only then will I tilt my hat. I'm glad she's almost fired. But fire the lady and then lock her behind bars. She almost killed a man.
27,Belongs to r/MGTOW

33,I thought Johnny Depp's career was over and that he was kind of a simp pleb. But you know with Johnny Depp's tremendous success and looking at his face and demeaner aswel he must be a smart man and was able to achieve victory over this bitch.
34,Shes still hot at least maybe she'll do some porn in desperation
35,What did she do?
36,Why?
37,"Correct. In the modern western world, there is a silent, collective agreement that women are sitting at the top of the food chain. They have to be heard, protected and they are always right

So we need, as a ""society"", to collectively agree that what a woman has done is wrong before a decision to fire her has to be made. The decision needs to pass through all filters. The legal filter, the filter of what other women/feminist groups say about her etc.

And once everyone is kind of sure that it is okaish to take action, then she is fired."
38,This here. Justice delayed is justice denied.
39,"Unless it's Youtubers, people are nasty and will cancel anyone with a platform for the slightest transgression. Its honestly a little scary :/"

45,"Indeed she is beautiful woman... with an ugly heart.

Beauty is skin deep."
46,"Any self respecting man in Hollywood wouldn’t be foolish enough to get emotionally involved with a women of her nature. Pump and dump at the very least, but even that’s pushing it. I can see her trying to capitalize off of one of her one night stands and making her self out to be a victim in order turn her whole image around."
47,"She was married to Johnny Depp and accused him of abusing her, which cost him a few roles and people hated him, but he always said that she was the abuser but no one believed him. A few weeks ago some audio files were leaked that he recorded where she admitted to being the abuser (screaming at him, hitting him, etc.) and people petitioned to have her removed from her role in Aquaman."
48,Did? What? Who?
49,"No, this is celebrating a victory for depp. She ruined his life and falsely accused him of rape and abuse while she was the one doing those things. His life is finally turning around again and his abuser is finally receiving some form of punishment"

60,"She also took a shit in his bed, as a ""prank"", cheated on him with James Franco and Elon Musk, and had already been taken in front of a judge for intimate partner violence in an airport on her ex wife (yes ex wife).
(She accused the cop who arrested her for battery in the airport of being homophobic and misyoginistic when the officer who did so was a lesbian married activist, i.e. woman.)

64,"> taken in front of a judge for intimate partner violence in an airport on her ex wife (yes ex wife)

Not that shocking.  The only time courts take women abusers seriously is when the victim is another woman.

Lesbian relationships have the highest abuse rates.  I'm sure they also cost 10x to litigate because the court has to actually figure out whose fault it is.

I'm not sure if it is actually anything intrinsic to women, or if it is just that when you coddle somebody anytime they play the victim card it reinforces that behavior.  I'm sure if you were raising a pair of brothers and always punished the one brother anytime either one raised a complaint regardless of fault, you'd end up with one boy who shuns authority and one who appeals to authority every chance they can."
65,"The solution is simple. Measure each plaintiffs testosterone and estrogen levels and and the one with the highest ratio of testo is obviously guilty.

/s...."
66,"The craziest part in this is that her ex wife, is now defending her as well saying Amber is ""awesome yadee yada"" and also saying the cop who arrested them targeted them for being lesbians.
Basically she's defending her ex abusive wife in order to push the""misoginy homophobia"" retoric even though she was assaulted.
Basically two liars now. Same fabric as Jussie Smollet and others.
God help us all."

70,The Return of the Kings.
71,"Can we quit the stupid ""king"" sh*t?!  Sounds like RP mgtow1 stuff. I vomit when I hear a woman describe herself as a queen/princess...no different with ""king"". I, you, are not kings. We don't rule people, we don't run governments. Just be ""men"" and stop sounding like we're overcompensating. Real manhood isn't having to puff yourself up. It's quiet confidence. (if it was sarcastic, disregard)"
72,"What is my take for this pic...


(1). A fighter on ground - You tried initially to fight with injustice by being loyal, friendly and courageous... but you realize that society is not meant what you had initially been taught to... 


what I learned “if you are vegan doesn’t mean crocs are vegan too...” 


(2) arrows on shield - people will throw their thoughts and beliefs at you (Incel, pussy, not a real man, small dick...) when you GYOW.... but you have to shield yourself from those useless arrows and fights... 

my learning - choose your fight.. not all fights are worth your time and energy. 


(3) thinking head - while being broken concentrate on why you broke at first place ... what was that mentality that broke you... (being bluepilled, being a simp, being a white knight - I was all of these before GMOW) now I realized my mistakes and learning from it..

My learning - I am able to change my beliefs and accept the reality... 


(4) a foot holding a ground - shows my mentality - I may be attacked and on ground but certainly not defeated.. shows my determination to win again... this man has still has life power baby... 

My learning : Hold your ground. Don’t accept the defeat.. you may be going through tough time but certainly not dead...

(5) My sword in my broken hand - Shows that you (wife & Society) May have broken my hands (took maintenance and my child against my will) but I still has power to lift my sword and fight back...

My learning - I will fight... this time for my self...

Final thought: I may get hit hard but will fight back...  i was the King and I will be KIIINGGGGG you fuckers (society and my wife)...."

92,"Rise my kings, rise!"
93,"I've seen the ""MGTOWs are kings!"" crap pop up on MGTOW1 and Youtube comments. It's reverse virtue-signalling, which is just virtue-signalling; just like reverse discrimination is still discrimination. 

MGTOW is a rational decision, based on cost/benefit analysis of marriage and cohabitation. ""We are kings"" is far away from that."

136,"Once i kept my main room/living room nicely decorated by a buddy wife.  I had kept it up and put all my man things in the basement, like a big screen, my desk, pc ,,you get it.  And I’ll admit it  was to have an area that I could entertain women.  Over time and a few shitty relationships I  started asking myself the tough questions and first was do I really want a women moving in or marriage for that.  I have always had a very low trust factor for women. And without going into it the lack of trust stemmed from some very criminal things by women, that no one would believe.  I wasn’t an INCEL, far from it, but after the “experience” I retreated and stopped dating.  And witnessed other warning signs with friends and coworkers .  So I asked those questions, do I really want to have a wife/women in my life to the extent of bring them home or marrying, and the answer was no, hell no.  So I bought a huge screen, cut a hole in the dinning room table to mount a tv in to play games with friends, decorated my walls with dragon heads, swords , and so on.  So now my man cave is my whole house and I vouknr care less what any women would say, because I’ll probably be pushing them out the door to a cab.and I love my childish dungeon."

258,"Dude. Trust me. Just go and live for yourself. Remember that she was living her life before you and she'll continue to live her life after you. You need to cut ties and live life for you. If you're scared, listen to your gut and just move on man."
259,You deserve better than being in a relationship that you're taken for granted. You can find someone else that will appreciate you for all that you're worth. Just make sure that you also don't forget your worth.

I remember when I used to have to justify every single PC purchase to my ex because she was a control freak. I’d have to scrounge for used video cards that were one generation old and hope for hand me down parts from work. 

When you’re off the plantation, you can buy whatever the hell you want. I mostly play COD but have been messing with Division 2 and Ghost Recon Breakpoint. So nice to unwind after work and not have to justify what I use my leisure time for."

I mean, you can hack on any machine, but a nice tower pc with a shit ton of ram, lots of cpu cores, with some nice mechanical keyboard and at least two displays is a really awesome life style thing and certainly not a waste of money.

307,"This is about as overkill as you can get. You can build a pretty good PC for around 1k and a very nice one for around 1500. This PC is stupidly overbuilt. 

It’s got a 32-core professor that costs $2k on its own. Most professors have 4 or 8 cores and are under 400 dollars. This motherboard is about 900 bucks, and the average motherboard is under 200.

I do not miss those days. I’m also into audio and hate seeing guys posting about what their wives allow in the house. They think it’s funny to talk about WAF - wife acceptance factor. If the wife things it’s “ugly,” they can’t buy it with their own money. I get it, you shouldn’t put your finances at risk for fun toys, but if you can afford it, then the wife shouldn’t care."
320,"btw, amd earlier had some cpu heat and stability issues.  Also, their laptop cpu range are not that power efficient. Cost-wise they are good competition to intel, also as a open source driver supporter should be tolerated more indeed.

322,Because I’m a free American.
323,"WAF just means she controls the discretional spending money and dictates what the house should look like. Granted, some women have immaculate homes with the latest fashions - their homes look like a magazine shoot. And that's fine, if you like cleaning 2 hours per day or paying someone else to.

I like a reasonably clean, tidy but lived in home.

As for toys, women think all money not spent on them = wasted money.
They think all time not spent on THEIR wants is wasted time.

Golf club - money could be spent on shoes!
Guy night - time could be spent doing HER shit.

Most women see the man in the relationship as a sort of pet, an appendage. SHE is the relationship. He's a mere appendage.

Most guys don't understand this about women and buy into that ""mutuality"" and ""egalitarian this and that"" bullshit."

AMD's Ryzen Pro is doing double duty as a processor and house heater  https://www.pcgamer.com/amds-ryzen-pro-is-doing-double-duty-as-a-processor-and-house-heater/

Am not against amd, rather support them by purchasing gpus, etc. occasionally.  However, not ignorant to concerns.  May be things changed a lot these days.

btw, I'm open to hear about OP's concerns, if they were valid, not here to 'argue' but all ears to listen."

331,"Found the fanboi.

For all concerns raised by my posts, I provided very valid response from industry itself.  Concerning amd cpu heating issue which so rampant, that somebody ran house heating industry on that.  So, it is not some random issue, it was well known.

I'll fully accept the fact the amd cpu may be performing more power efficiently now, but denying concerns will not be right.

Much of your post in only emotional rant, except few cpu info which is common knowledge to almost everyone on internet.  Not into emotionally volatile fanboism into anything.  So, bye."
332,I am grateful for everything I have and enjoy

Reality dictates it could be much much worse.

For all those struggling, hang in there.  Things get better."
334,"That knowledge helped get me through the early Redpill Rage. Even while homeless, I had solid roads to walk down, trashcans with food, ashtrays with half-smoked butts. You'd be amazed how grateful you can become for things like sleeping in an -actual- bed, instead of a car or sofa. A hot bath, running water...

This quarantine in my camper is laughable by comparison. I just got laid off, but due to MGTOW minimalism, I've got enough of an emergency fund to make it two months in perfect comfort, before any outside help.

348,"When I lived in Great Falls, Montana, there was an apparently homeless lady who would come into the DQ Brazier on the regular and dig the butts out of the ashtrays on the tables and find a paper wrapper from a stick of Juicy Fruit gum. She’d field strip the butts and put the tobacco on the wrapper and throw away the filters and detritus. She’d roll up the wrapper like cigarette paper and bum a light and have a free smoke. 

In the TV show The Incredible Hulk with Bill Bobby, Bixby had a speech in which he suggested getting a cup of hot water at a restaurant and adding to it some ketchup to make tomato soup, and buying hot tea and asking them to leave the tea bag so he could get a second cup of hot water and use the tea bag a second time. Passable meal for the cost of a single cup of tea."

But the lessons from that time, and the situation that lead to it (a woman, what else?) make this a not-so big thing. I've got gratitude, like the OP was speaking of."
353,Yeah man. Maybe my message didn't come across I was just kidding lol.
354,"How about people that their main hobbies and passion is nature,hiking,gym and swimming? Yes I know it's only in my mind..I can just build a hiking trail,fresh air,beach and a gym.

391,"This is someone telling a story of someone telling a story so of course take it with a grain of salt but from what I remember this is California. They had a long term marriage, the wife shacked up with a younger man and they divorced. The alimony was set for life. Meaning as long as she didn't work or remarry she'd require alimony. Or one of them died then alimony  payment requirements would end. And from the looks of it, California court CAN do this. So to quote Joe Rogan: ""it's entirely possible""

423,"Good for you man! You'll find life to be SO SIMPLE - lunches, workouts, hair-cuts, doing fun things with your dad...  I found relationships to be soul draining. It was never enough, no matter what ""it"" was. And I certainly don't miss that male-female communication where instead of being grownups and ""using our words"" I have to guess what the fuck she's thinking because that too is a shit test I need to pass to show that I care. Fuck. That. Noise. My kids are well past toddler age now, and I sure as hell don't want a full-size one in my house. When my kids want something they ask for it and usually get it. If they want more affection or attention it's simply obvious. That's because for them it's *not a fucking shit test or a game.*"
424,"Congratulations, bro! Relationships (aka ""mindfuckery"") are a certain way to lose self-respect for a man. Now make your life plans and stick to them. Good luck!"
425,"As a man whos never actually been in a relationship, therefore can't really understand that dynamics of one, I just have to ask why you thought you were trapped and had to stay with her? Its just a mindset I'm too naive to fathom, since to me a relationship such as this is nothing more than a verbal agreement of coexistence between 2 people."

427,I wasted about five or six years like that. Maybe even more if I count shorter relationships. Then one day I realized that life can be good and happy. Now it *is* good and happy.

436,"Not sure if this is related yet years ago I was in a relationship with a girl for about 3 months, then we had a mutual breakup, I wasn't that into her but I enjoyed the sex. The next 9 months we spent having sex. It was so much better having sex outside of being in a relationship than being in one. I'm 39 now and at the time I was 29, she was 33 I think with a 4 year old kid. I told her at the time I wasn't looking to be a dad to her kid. Maybe you will have a similar experience. I used to want to be in a relationship yet after approaching a lot of women PUA style for the last couple of years and hooking up with 18 different girls in about a span of a year in a half I started to value my alone time. Now I'm in some sort of monk/hermit mode working to get my shit together. I'm a single dad with an 8 year old son so now it's all about me, him, finances, business, getting my ass in shape and working on getting my CCNA at the moment. I fucking love the fuck out of women yet they can be a distraction especially when I thought that chasing women was the key. I never plan on getting married and look forward to having a lot more fun when I take care of the shit that needs to be taken care of in my life.  

  
With all that said have fun!"

443,"Biology/Societal Norms trap us.

It's scary knowing society will defend women, no matter what, so the longer you're with someone, the more chances you have of getting financially/emotionally/legally destroyed.   


It's fucking terrifying, and some dudes would rather have ""sTaTuS"" than to protect themselves, protect their friend group, and their money. 

Shit is crazy, I feel like a crazy person every day, seeing friends just eat shit from their slave-owners, and feeling fucking VIRTUOUS about it. Give me a fucking break. 

I won't lie, the crazy bitches are good at what they do. It's as impressive as it is fucking disgusting, and ruthless, but they've shown me, to go the other way."
444, where's the previous mgtow community?
445,"Just an observation, but if you go into r/relationship_advice the sub is filled with women cheating on men and cheating in general. Modern society treats cheating and divorce almost like a normal thing now...MGTOW is the logical choice in these times anyways."

452,He’s not very good but we have a swell time
453,"Well it comes and goes. Like things would be great for a while then Something would happen and our relationship would become bad for a while, and I’d pull away from her. Then we would make up and have crazy sex and things would be good again until they weren’t. That combined with pregnancy scares, I can’t break up with her until I know she’s not pregnant because then she is still in my life and our relationship is just that much harder, so I should wait. Then on top of that mental issues, I can’t break up with her because that is just gonna drive her over the edge and she’s gonna kill herself or she’s gonna lose her job or whatever. Plus I really did love her and we did have a lot of amazing times together. That all adds up to I can’t just leave her, I should wait things are gonna be ok, if I just love her enough if I just provide enough she will be happy and then we can be happy.
But this morning her parents found another guy in her bed. A “friend” from her childhood I guess. And on top of that last night I was texting her then she “went to bed early” and did that shit where I said goodnight and that I loved her, and she replied with k night. So I knew something was up but I didn’t want to get into it with her so I just turned my phone off for the night, because I expected that she was gonna try and text me and dump some shit on me and I didn’t need that last night. But this morning there was nothing. Then she called and told me to block her parents. So I guess she was busy last night."

455,"Women want men that can be playful and non judgemental with them like when they were little kids except with rough and dirty sex.  This infuses them with feel good emotions. A lot of men don't understand this or don't have playful and dominant personalities. They are boring, serious, or too nice and/or needy. This turns women off. Its the basis for the red pill should a man choose to work on himself. The last thing a man should do is allow himself to be used or disrespected by his woman. You have to have a cocky, playful response to shit testing. If you are not good at this, don't get into a LTR.

There's a saying about a partner dying before the other one got sick of them so they're always remembered in a positive light.  Casual relationships work because they infuse women with that sense of newness they crave biologically. Also these men are typically more fun and dominant than the betas they end up in LTR with.  Would you want to live on nothing but pizza your whole lives? People don't want to hear this but we are not hardwired with monogamy in mind."

I used to worry about this from my now ex-wife (3 kids and tens of thousands in alimony and child support later) back when we were first dating. A woman will not kill herself over a man. I mean, I'm not saying it has never happened, but it's extremely rare. I think men think that is more common than it is because we project our way of thinking on to them. A man killing himself over a woman is much, much more likely."

Not sure how old you are, but you seem young. I’m almost 18-years old, and I’m officially going my own way. It’s hard to control urges and not snapchat a girl back when she’s trying to instigate something sexual, but I’m controlling my hormones.

I’m sure you’re a good looking guy. I’ve learned that being indifferent to relationships drives girls crazy. If you can turn down a good looking girl and be nice and sincere about it, it’ll drive them **insane**. Don’t be a dick about it, but I found that just not being interested in talking much or seeing them will drive them crazy and make them want you more.

At a younger age, going your own way is definitely in your best financial interest. Good for you man."

Not everyone who breaks away from the norm and goes their own way is going to go away they feel is preferred.

You don't need to embrace femininity though. We live in a time that people say you need to accept who you are as if that is unchangeable. I tried to just embrace it when I was a feminist and one day I looked at myself and felt like I was a caricature, that 'leaning into it' was just as much an act as trying to hide it.

There is a similar movement that says we need to accept our bodies as they are, but that isn't true. There are certain parts of you that you shouldn't try to force a change on, aspects that deal with your emotional well being and your happiness. But the way you pose, the way you speak, the words you use, how you dress, those are easily  changed things and more than one path can make you happy. These aren't 'who you are'.  These are just the cosmetics of behavior, things that can be easily changed to suit who you want to become."

531,"How? Genuinely, how? What are the odds that some big employer can find that particular post / photo without already knowing that your reddit account is associated with MGTOW?"
532,"Tbh my dream atm is to pursue a career of music or acting. Pretty generic I know, and a 1 in a billion chance of success, but these have always been things I loved to do, and I'd at least like to learn all I can about them if not make a career out of it."
533,Unless it's med school or nursing. Male nurses are always in demand and make bank.
534,What was wrong with the pose? Internet connection is shit right now so I can’t look it up myself.
535,I never said anything about disliking you. You're just reminding me of every other snowflake I see on the internet. Yeah he might have some feminine qualities but nobody is being homophobic to him. People toss phobias around to freely.
536,"We are talking about the pose, the bleached hair, the wrist flick, you are just looking to be relevant."
537,No joke. You don't criticise someone who is afraid of snakes as being less than human...why do people discriminate against people who have a natural aversion to homosexuality? But I can't criticize you because perhaps you are naturally homophobephobic or more likely heterophobic...I understand you
538,[deleted]
539,"Then you are set. Make and save loot at Dominoe's and live cheap while you pursue your goals. In your postition, I'd choose music because you can put it out online for practically free and maybe you'll get a following. Music is practically post-scarcity nowadays. 

Acting might be tougher. That's still a gatekeeper industry and you'll have to try to break into ivory towers and whatnot. As for music, no one can silence you with the tools you have at your disposal today. Keep on rockin' in the clown world!"
540,"Very true, medicine is included in STEM."
541,It looked like one of those “cute” poses girls try to do on Social media
542,"Agreed, my bad for tossing the “homophobia” thing around. I guess I’m just being influenced and now it happens every now and again. Sorry, I didn’t mean my original comment."
543,"That I am, nice catch. But honestly, he didn’t look too bad."
544,"Because there’s a clear difference between homosexuality and snakes. 1. Homosexuals are the same species as you. 2. Homosexuality does not bite you. 3. I’m not saying you’re less than human, but your morals are iffy at best. 4. I’m neither “homophobephobic” nor heterophobic. Your flaw in this argument is that you can choose to be homophobic, but I cannot chose whether to be homosexual or not."
545,What? you think that their future employers are going to back track your IP address to the one you had years ago and go through your entire internet history focusing on reddit but not your porn?
546,You're a cool dude for admitting that you're wrong. Need more people like you
547,"People who are sensitive are snowflakes.

You jumped to homophobia way too fast pop, we find it repulsive, that doesn’t make us homophobic.

Another example, I've given male friends the possibility to ""earn"" some alms by selling some of my stuff online ""on commission"".  He earned it and did something useful for me."
582,"Employing your friend is not the type of support I mean, I would think ""employing your friend"" isn't quite the same either.

586,"Well, I called a guy racist. Why? He actively contacted black women on dating sites to tell them he isn't attracted to them because they're black. So I guess I'm a white knight now."
587,"The only downside to this sub is the woman, mgtow is suppose to be men only, and also you can get banned for saying stuff like men only. Its not too much to ask for a mens only sub, theres plenty of woman only subs and because mgtow is about helping fellow men and overcoming the need to socialize with females its only logical that it would be the sub that is specifically for men, by pushing females down our throats you are working against your goal and only making me not want to interact with woman more."
588,"/r/MGTOW mods are snowflakes, weak-minded insecure beta males who can't take criticism and opposite opinions. They are basically the male version of feminists.

Prior to that, I made multiple post, and karma was fine, so it was obvious my post weren't trolling.  Was banned, no explanation, and no response when responding to the ban."
591,"Absolute power corrupts.  It's just a matter of time.

Imagine having the ability to permanently silenced anyone you don't like,  and there is no one to challenge or question your decisions or motives. 

They are becoming the very thing they claim to be against.   Funny thing is, they will complain about being banned from other subs,  but they are doing the same thing, banning people for trivial reasons or 'wrong' think."
592,They are massive pussies over there. That is all I can really say.
593,"As a subscriber on both subs.

FYI 
calling women on their shit =/= hating on women.
Just so we're clear.

Mgtow is good for showing the double standards and women shenanigans

Mgtow 2 is for the wholesome posts, advices, self improvement and so on..

I really don't get why there needs to be a divide."
594,"There was a post that was hating on a 66 y/o woman for not fending off a pitbull that was mauling a child. Everyone in the thread was hating on her, saying women want equality but they're afraid to be heroes when the time comes.

They all neglected to mention the poor woman broke her arm when the dog attacked her, so she was in shock and unable to fight the dog. Luckily, a man was there to step in and save the child. He motioned for her to get help while he dealt with the dog.

Everyone in the thread ignored this part of the story, even when other people were posting links to the news article explaining the circumstances. The comments were disgusting, and not at all about GYOW.

So I posted links to several videos of women saving children from dangerous situations and then pointed out that there's a difference between going your own way and being a misogynist.

Ban came in 5 min later. Good riddance."
595,"There is literally a sub called ""againstmensrights"" that isnt considered hate but mgtow is taken down.."
596,Can someone tell me what and why that happened to MGTOW subreddit? I am really sad. Is this a sign of direct attack on men?
597,"got banned for no reason, with +30k karma and years of productive posts. F them"
598,I’m not banned I just left because it became totally overrun by incels.
599,"8 months ago I got banned after years of posts and 23.8 karma rating mainly from that reddit. They got so scared of being shut down they just started banning everybody and they are still going to get shut down. That quarantine is just a warning before being shut down. Nobody really knows anymore what offends somebody else, you just better not offend any woman or liberal Democrat in this society. If they can't have you arrested, they will make you lose your job."
600,They banned me because I said that not all native Americans are drug addicts
601,When I search for MGTOW now it doesn't even show up. What the heck.
602,Where am I supposed to get my daily dose of redpills anymore? I feel so lost and isolated.
603,"I never thought I'd be writing this, but here I am, permanently banned from r/MGTOW.  This ""guy"" was crying about how women ruined his life with a bad haircut and shitty customer service.  This was my response:

>Still,  you've most likely got a roof over your head, clothes on your back and  food in your stomach.  You're probably not dying of ass cancer,  suffering from some fucked up genetic condition or locked up for a crime  you didn't commit.  Were that the case, you'd have more pressing issues  than whining about a poor customer service experience to strangers on  the internet.  You sound just like a woman.  Ironic that you're out  here, isn't it?  
>  
>Go volunteer at a  men's shelter, at a hospice or at the burn unit at a kids hospital and  then tell me how important your bad haircut really is.  Maybe then  you'll understand what I mean by gratitude and perspective.

He responded by getting me banned (not that I care) and calling me a woman and a feminist on a 3-week old comment on this sub.  Just thought I'd share my story."
604,Banned for unknown reasons.
605,"Yeah, I did.

I think it was because I told a guy he could have sex with a woman.

How dare I not follow the monk-tow creed."
606,[deleted]
607,"I made a joke about the sub IT on their behalf and they thought I was calling them incels, even though I added context the numbskulls reacted with emotion rather than logic.

Cunts."
608,"Welp I just joined the club.

Still waiting to hear what I did. I didn't break any rules that I know of."
609,"They were talking about how dumb it was to spend money on nice clothes. I said since I was saving money by not dating, I could afford them. 

Guy was going on and on about how buying premium denim made me a cuck lmao

I replied “ all pants are the same”

Snap ban, didn’t break any rules, but snap perms banned anyways. 

Bunch of heartbroken teenagers over there."
610,"Banned with no explanation. After weeks of messaging mods one said that I was banned for 'concern trolling' and cited a specific post. The post in question was about a comment that people on the board make a lot, that 'women have nothing to contribute to a relationship'. Which made me think, What do we have to contribute to a relationship as men? Perhaps money, but what else?

It wasn't concern trolling it was a genuine question that wasn't just about everyone else, but about me as well. What do I really offer in a relationship?  A lot of people freaked out in the comments, kept insisting they have 'love, loyalty,' those vague intangible things a girl would say as well.

But some of them made a really great point: men are a human shield. We are expected to lay down our lives to protect a woman, even if we aren't dating her. If we are just walking down the same alley as a woman and someone comes after her, we are expected to put ourselves between her and the attacker. As for women we actually date, its basically a 'get out of jail free' card for as long as they keep us around"
611,"The first sub I was ever banned from. I mentioned that it was being infiltrated by many that do not know the meaning of it. 

I was having a nice discussion with another and our of nowhere the admin banned me. 

Terrible admins."
612,"Guys. We need to unit again. Stop fighting with each other. Banning mgtow is a serious issue. 
Someone did not like the unstoppable mgtow force as it was about to surpass the popularity of men hating subreddits"
613,"I don't think anyone got banned.  We all got dumped somehow when they quarantined the sub.  I had to find it via a link and rejoin after aknowledging several times that I know I was joining a quarantined sub with ""extreme"" views."
614,Just got banned for calling them out on their misogyny. There’s no reason to fat-shame random women on the Internet. That’s not part of going your own way.
615,I got banned for saying that it’s not healthy to take steroids to a steroid user.
616,The mods have no patience with anyone not supporting the party line.  Discussion doesn’t seem to be allowed.

618,"Things Are Getting Out Of Hand (repost) (got banned from MGTOW for this statement)

Both MGTOW and feminism are at each other's throats like cats and rats and I'm getting confused about it all. There's so much hate that both sides have lost sight of what the actual point is. 

I thought we were all for equality, but all I see is women giving advice on how to subjugate a man, or men pushing for dystopian misogynistic ideals. At first, I was completely and utterly fooled by the MGTOW movement (being a man, of course) then after going through all the hostility, I see one post about someone climbing a beautiful mountain, achieving satisfaction, and being a better person from the experience. 

When I saw this, and then looked back at all the women slandering comments, I was like Jesus, this guy really knows what MGTOW really is. 

The people in that sub have got it all wrong, sure there IS inequality, but, throwing more fuel in the fire for feminist activists ain't gonna help.

I remember seeing a black man on TED who went to talk to the leader of the KKK himself, (link here -> https://youtu.be/ORp3q1Oaezw) and after so much diplomacy, got him to leave the group. It showed me that if each party respect each other, they'll bond and find trust within each other to work forward towards a common goal.

But with feminism (in it's current state) and MGTOW, it feels like the point is to pull each other apart as much as possible until a breaking point. Sure, there are pretty bad cases out there, but don't you think we should band together for a common purpose to change those laws and make it truly equal?

Both sides, men and women, have lost the point. MGTOW, if they are going their own way, need to cut out the obsession. Feminism and predominately 'feminine' groups such as the female dating advice subreddit, need to stop clearly trying to provoke bitterness between the genders and look for a common ground to start building good relationships with men over.

I'm just sick of it all, you can't trust neither side."
619,"Banned from MGTOW for not hating women. Also banned from MensLib for beeing MGTOW. Yeesh. Seems like you can't not have radical opinions on reddit to not be banned.

Waiting to be banned from MensRights for being egalitarian one of these days."
620,"I'm still joined but just it was Quarantined. At work, I realized I hadn't seen a post or got a Trending notification in a while, and started looking. WT*actual*F"
621,"I got banned for commenting ""What does that have to do with going your own way tho?"" on a low effort meme about trangender people."
622,they banned me because i hate women
623,Was banned for a comment response stating that I’m gay in which it was necessary to state my sexuality to establish context.
624,When r/incels shut down I knew they would leak into a bunch of other subreddits and fuck them up.
625,"I was banned a while ago for simply saying a grown man had made the choice to be with a single mother and there is nothing wrong with that.

MGTOW was completely overrun with hateful incels and for some reason the mods were supporting them. All of a sudden incel terminology was being used to shame people that often had done nothing wrong.

To me, MGTOW was about internalising the rational male principles and choosing not to go along with it, Not trying to change human nature by shaming and hating on people.

For a group of incels that hated women and simps so much, They sure are sacrificing a lot to increase their SMV and be with them. I should have left a long time ago"
626,"Wtf..?  Seriously??  Yeah, I just got banned yesterday.  Why?  Couldn't tell you.  I think it could possibly be for referring a guy who laid out a bunch of VERY specific standards for the women he was looking for to a Christian dating site.    

Suddenly... banned. 

The fuck is with those guys, over there..?"
627,"Banned for this:


https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/dscxnj/comment/f6qjbjr"
628,"I got banned after telling how I, as a young woman, found the subreddit, that it is the only place I know where I have the feeling that I can openly express my views on relationships and women who divorce-rape and are just sub-humans in general when it comes to their morals and what I think of what the other redditors say. I basically just said that my thoughts vary from ""I'm 100% with you"" to ""sounds bitter, but for understandable reasons."" to ""WTF is wrong with you for glorifying sharia law?"". What should I say? Approximately 5 minutes after I posted this I got the notification that I'm permanently banned. I couldn't even have a look at the reply to my comment because everything went so fast."
629,I was open about the women hating incel posts and made an opinion about it and was immediately banned
630,"My display page shows that the community has been quarantined..
What’s up???"
631,"Thought that i was banned but the sub is just quarantined, you can still go it it."
632,"Got banned months ago for calling someone out on their decision to celebrate going his own way by taking sometime else's life away from them. 

I still visit regularly but can't post anything. I explained to the mod my rationale and that I was mgtow but got no response."
633,"The official mgtow Reddit has been quarantined / banned by the platform. I wasn't banned, but seeing the libtard direction that community has been going... Well deserved.  I'm looking on here and I see all the people that got banned by MGTOW's censorship, looks like the censors have been censored! Excellent karma! HAHAHA"
634,I don't know why I got banned probably because I disagreed with some people ( like some women do get raped and we don't live in the worst time ever ) lmao what a joke
635,"I got banned for saying that no one should get married without a prenup. I told them about how I refused to marry my ex without a prenup because I’m my parent’s sole heir, and my ex made terrible financial decisions. I told them I agreed with them 🤪"
636,I have no idea why I was banned.  All my karma was from posting on MGTOW but after the quarantine I edited a lot of my history to keep from getting doxxed.  Then 2 days ago I was banned and none of the mods will reply to my msgs asking why.
637,"I got banned for saying that someone was a sexist because they said something incredibly sexist

Basically said women are objects and should stay in the house unless they’ll get slapped

Which is a pretty dickish thing to say"
638,"Got banned a while ago. From what I remember, it was from pushing back against someone saying that monk mode is the only way to go. 

I like fucking women. Apparently that’s a bannable offence."
639,"I got banned for pointing out hypocrisy. It’s cool if you want to go your own way. But I don’t like extremists from either end whether you’re a feminist or a MGTOW. The whole “All women are the same we know everything about them and their con artist nature.” Is no different than women claiming “All men are the same we know everything about their rape craving nature.” I like the main idea such as pointing out legitimate systemic oppression such as inequality in family court and little to no help with domestic violence towards men. But to paint all women as bad and to attack the women that agree with you and to attack women such as Daisy Cousins who have nothing to gain for pointing out double standards, it makes you look like an immature like Undead Chronic who just mainly insults. I’m pretty sure that’s why he gets banned a lot as opposed to other MGTOW channels that are A LOT more civil. I find the “We don’t hate women, you feminist!” immediately followed up with “Fuck off cunt! Why are you, a woman here?!?!” Hilarious. They’re sinking themselves.

And the the whole “Women are bad brother come drink with us!” Sounds like the counter parts to the bitter divorced woman club that hates men and can’t just live their lives out to be happy."
640,"I got banned for calling a dude an incel. I don’t usually throw terms around like “incel” so loosely, but this guy was acting like a complete *victim*. He blamed the world for his fuckin problems, and thought he was owed female validation. This guy was spewing straight Elliot Roger shit. I can safely say this guy was a no shit incel."
641,"I was banned for posting this; 

I'm going to get downvoted, but I think it needs to be said.

There are many people here in the rage stage, and some incels that have moved to a new home, and that's okay, but it's not a place where you get to bitch, ad infinitum. At least it wasn't before at 60k.

Breathe. You're not dead yet."
642,"Banned for calling it was it was, an incel sub. Hopefully this sub stays the course and doesn’t degenerate into a sweaty neck beard fest."
643,"Someone had posted the very platitude driven kind of 'it gets better', and I argued against it. So I got banned. This man was saying that people who missed their kids the wives had stolen could solve it just by going shopping at the mall on Christmas. I wasn't even rude. For many men it doesn't get better, particularly if the child died instead of just being taken away."
644,"Not banned, just got a wall of text with insults because I mentioned I used to have single moms as booty calls. Surprise, surprise, I got 12 ""MGTOW"" occurrences on his first page of his history. I think it is funny how easily triggered some of these guys are."
645,I used incel lingo to troll the incel who posted a racially aware blackpill comic misguidingly attacking MGTOW (though the comic is really aimed at TRP or rather PUA).
646,"I haven't been banned there, but I do notice a large number of posts that get deleted by the mods.  To me they don't seem to violate any rules but they get deleted anyway."
647,I put a sarcastic comment there and I was banned.
648,"I posted a wholesome thing that was basically saying:
""Don't attack others for what someone else has done to you.""
Yeah, instant ban."
649,"I guess I have to join the club. The comment for which I was apparently banned related to a female astronaut collapsing during a press conference. The assertion made was that the collapse is proof that woman shouldn't be astronauts. 

My reply: ""Eh, I'd be leery of making assumptions. Maybe she's sick. Maybe her blood sugar was too low. There are a lot of explanations for a collapse. Maybe the stress of space travel, lack of gravity and whatnot, acts different on a woman's body. Who knows. 

Just because one female astronaut collapsed doesn't necessarily say anything whatever about female astronauts in general.""

That comment is apparently deserving of a permanent ban from mgtow1. I will update if the mods respond to my DM."
650,"There’s a comic strip of Superman carrying Lois Lane in a skirt where someone commented: ‘back when women dressed like women and wore skirt’

I replied with ‘now the men do’ which got +47

Two posts later I said ‘I’m one of those guys’ which got me the -10 and a ban

🤷🏻‍♀️ oh well 😂"
651,"Jokingly called a kid Chad that posted a pic of himself posing on a motorcycle after his break up. It was obviously a joke as he was good looking, but that's all it took to get me banned. 

Cucked mods didnt even give me an explanation when I questioned the ban. Apparently the place is no different than the rest of reddit"
652,Wth happened
653,Was I banned or was it just completely shut down? I couldn’t find it.
654,Cancel culture is real.
655,"MGTOW is quarantined

656,"No, but I think they took down the MGTOW mega thread
Damn shame"
657,Why is it that subs like r/pinkpillfeminism dont get banned?
658,Just got banned for downvoting a couple of nasty posts against female homeless .. and some other low effort female bashing. it's pretty funny how you can be a member of a group for months and the moment you say something against them you're gone.
659,Simps and manginas at it again. Ahh reddit...run by fags and dumb asses lol
660,i am not banned but the community doesn't show up in search and it says the community is quarantined.
661,"Just got banned for telling someone ( who was calling anti male subs echo chambers ) to be careful that r/mgtow might become the same. 

I dont know, as i never got an explanation. So i asked if r/mgtow was r/feminism. No answer.

I guess it became a self fulfilling profecy as i dont like hypocrites and try to have integrity. Calling out others shitty behaviour and not have integrity is a no no in my book."
662,Apparently attacking environmental activists is in the spirit of mgtow just because they are female. (Greta Thunberg)
663,"I haven’t been banned yet. But I sense some bitterness from the old MGTOW thread. Not gonna lie, when I surf their pages it puts me in a funk. 

I guess I can’t blame some guys for being a bit bitter. I was for a long long time. Mgtow, if used effectively can be a remedy for that bitterness."
664,"Didn't know a regular straight guy could get banned from
MGTOW, wow."
665,"They tried to attack Greta Thunberg, implying that she is famous because she is a female, compared to males that didn't get so famous, and so I tried to correct them. Guess who got banned"
666,"I think I got banned because I admitted to being  a trans male. I never posted and I only ever commented that one thing so now I’m banned from participating. The message didn’t say why I was banned, it just said that I was."
667,"I was banned for simply stating that man should focus on they money, rebuilding they credit & to forget these feminist thots for 2020. I personally think it's ridiculous to get banned for that. I did reach out to the moderator via email but no reply I SAID PHUCK IT! TOO MANY FEMININE MEN ON THAT PANEL PRETENDING TO BE SOMETHING THEY NOT SO WHATEVER... "" This is not a brotherhood of empowering man like I thought. """
668,I got banned. I told a dude its not a political sub. all you here on there now is snowflake cuck libtard and a gang of trump pics and memes. it's like bro its go your own way not be a little bitch to the establishment and out your needs on anyone. I thought as men we would be able to not have political lines but apparently I'm just a fucking libtard cuck.
669,"Wasn’t banned,  but just couldn’t take the weird amount of barely disguised alt right/white supremacy/hate all foreigner/anti immigrant trad con bs that has nothing to do with mgtow. It is ironic that they are super patriotic towards the same US/western culture that gave the rest of the world modern feminism."

672,"About a year ago I got banned on MGTOW subreddit after reaching 250 upvotes on 2 posts in a row... no explanation, no reason. I said nothing offensive to anyone."
673,"I said that the reason the new Star Wars movies failed is because Disney doesn't care about producing ""good"" movies, they just want to produce movies that people will pay to see. I'm assuming I was banned for that because I didn't agree that the main character being a female is what ruined it but they never told me why I was banned so we'll never know."
674,I got banned cuz i dared question their ways . This Mgtow is the real mgtow. Those guys over there are running a cult.
675,Got banned for calling out the right wing propaganda it's a shame that sub has turned into a conservative propaganda factory
676,"Sorry, should have put my post here. But ya, I've already had a post removed like three times. Felt lke they were itching to remove me if it weren't for me driving decent activity. Would be nice if it were a requirement to explain reasoning for removal of posts and bans."
677,Got banned from /rant today and shortly after from /mgtow
678,Somebody mentioned on waatgm that mgtow was quarantined so I look on my sub list and it's gone. wtf?
679,I still can't believe I was banned. I thought that place was the only safe place on Reddit lol. What kind of hostile takeover is happening over there? Did a woman get mod powers? I know that's how I got banned from men's rights by a woman mod...
680,i got banned for telling a tranny that shes not a man
681,"I never posted but got banned, weird"
682,Mgtow got delated

685,I was banned for calling a gay fellow a certain adjective that begins with the letter F.
686,I made a joke about Brad Pitt being MGTOW on Once upon a time in Hollywood

688,"I dont know what I even got banned for, I hardly posted on there"
689,I got banned for saying nothing that’s weird.
690,I don't know why I got banned or who to contact about it. Can't find admins.
691,/r/MGTOW is dead and have zero members I just checked how many members there are. But people still post there.
692,someone changed his wi-fi name to MGTOW and i told him it is cringy behaviour
693,"Coz feminist starts to cover the ground in the subreddit. Spam reporting rants & opinions of other redditors meanwhile inceltears, pinkpillfeminism, FDS etc. Gets away it!!!"
694,MGTOW just got blocked “quarantined” on Reddit while they don’t even criticize feminist subs. Spread the word. Join r/RedditBringBackMGTOW  to demand they either bring it back or they do the same with feminist subs.
695,"We gonna come back stronger...
That shows that whatever content is put there is plain truth and an indication that that is the world we live in.."
696,"I got banned from MGTOW because I called out on someone who said COVID-19 is because of chinese dudes fucking bats. I commented to ask him to stop saying fucked up shit like that since I’m chinese and it is NOT COOL.

698,I worded a post wrong
699,"I was recently banned there and I've been following the subreddit for over a year. I've been a mgtow for 9 years now. No hard feelings, but I realize if you say anything contrary to the hivemind, they won't like that and I think that's the height of hypocrisy because it limits discussion."
700,i just got banned. Dumb
701,"I got banned 18 minutes after posting asking if any of you guys have research articles that corroborate their arguments. I wasn't trying to make any statement, I just wanted the articles, lol.  Within 5 minutes people were calling me ""Aunt Karen."" I don't even know what that's supposed to mean"
702,I haven't been banned from /r/MGTOW and I cannot find posts from you guys that would suposedly get you banned.  Can you point to links?
703,The first sub where I actually posted. I don't know what was so offensive that I am not able to access it anymore. Maybe I'm banned. No more posting on Reddit now only consuming content.
704,"I got banned because I posted a meme where this guy and women had an one night stand, and the guy wanted the women to leave so he took a shit in the bed. This was back in December of 2018 I believe."
705,"I appear to be banned and I've not made a comment for a while.  

Hostile takeover?"
706,I actually said I wanted to leave. I felt the posts were getting off topic. Sometime later I requested the admins to rejoin but never got an answer. I guess now I know they’re worse admins than what I thought.

Why is it always about what the men are doing and how do we stop that? What is it with society wanted to put so many different controls in motion on every level of a man from his dick/circumcision all the way to his psych, to laws of the land marriage/divorce, expectations as far as being provider, protector. What did they think would happen! Are we really just a slave gender that gets rewarded with ""a good life"" unless we screw up? Bummed out."
708,I don't even know why and when I got banned. Suddenly it just says I'm not allowed to view the community anymore. What did I do?
709,"To paraphrase I called them incels.

To try and remember it was something like 'you just shit on women, no accountability yourselves...' no I can't even remember. 

I probably tried to sprinkle jq in there too.. Alexa, who owns Mindgeek?"
710,I got banned (i think) for calling one person a shill for women in a thread. I'd been on MGTOW since Oct 2018 never had a problem. I guess Blue pillers have taken over. It's sad. No response from the mods.
711,Got banned for asking what was happening on their discord and how to apply back (probably not sure). Do you'll think it's worth it to keep subbed to it? For the memes?
712,"I was banned from r/mgtow a while back for no reason at all. Is this a safe place, or will i get banned here too?"
713,"Just realized I was banned now, I don't comment much, weird."
714,I got banned for making a post telling people not to be incels
715,"I got banned for defending a Chinese guy because they told em that ""Chinese people eating bats.""

I told those mofos, ""that's straight down racist.""

I don't eat bats and I'm half chinese and wasn't born there. But those racist bitter incel losers throws some rage that they don't even have legit source to back it up and to tell that it came from China eating bats, chinese virus lmfao!!!

Bro, you've been eating meat and is no different from eating bats or dogs. You have sympathy to them but not guilty eating different kinds of animal meat? 

Hyprocrite little shits. I get the mindset stay away from women but goddamn the bitterness has been going for years now like every goddamn day.

Like instead of RANTING every fckin day, posting negative. Don't you have something better to do than ranting? No bullshit in the rules? The reason why I got banned is bullshit lmao.

Do something positive. You have TIME to procrastinate by posting hate posts against women that all aren't true but biased (no legit source, assuming evil biches because majority of women are biches) and leads to fuel the anger towards all women. 

I'm aware of what they do and what they are capable against men. I'm not protecting them, is just they're not all the same. But still I wouldn't risk it, If I were you.

The posts that leads to positivity in MGTOW to the benefit of our ownselves has there been always ignored. (Where I got kicked for some stupid Political post).

To me, the feminist rage level is over the chart goddamn. Bet you if it came from America, it would be like this. 

It came from America so it's an American Virus.

Society: that's what you get from eating chickens...

There's a bunch of trolls, snow flakes, bitter incels got nothing to do but throw hate but got no time for themselves.."
716,I was banned there a few days ago. Dont care why. Most people there are mgtow because no woman wants them and theyre angry at the world.
717,Lol Reddit already banned their new one they made yesterday.
718,"Ngl are you surprised it's gone? There's some serious people on that thread which talk about the only women they love are prostitutes because they know what they want (Yeah, you're money and they will do anything to get it), fear is the best tool to use to get women's respect (like wtf?)

&#x200B;

I'm all down for MGTOW because a lot of the stories were about some men who just recently went through a horrific divorce and they just wanted some pick me up...and then a solid majority of the posts were just sheer hatred towards women just because of their obscure experiences with women..."
719,Was banned because I state there might be a snitch mod in the sub
720,"As a subscriber to both, I can say that I don't believe many of the negative posts in here about mgtow, because I've not seen that on there, mgtow is literally calling out has behaviour from women and they don't like it.

R/MGTOW has been infiltrated by feminists and women complaining, this place is next because you Simps create divisions instead of just saying the truth, which is no one was breaking the rules in mgtow, no one was inciting hatred, only support and calling women out in their bad behaviour was what it consisted of. Anyone else saying bad things about mgtow is lost likely lying."
721,Sounds like women getting hot over these posts and simping is on the rise here. Im out.
722,"There was a post that I replied on saying how if you're not on Nofap you're not a real MGTOW. Got banned from the commenting again. I have come to a conclusion that it's either undercover simp maginas or feminist in this subreddit. And I'm standing by my argument that it you're not on Nofap you're really not MGTOW. No fap should be practiced by everybody in MGTOW, but I guess it's okay to jerk off to a chick that you can never touch. I shouldn't be banned for speaking my mind, that's literally what the community is about.

723,"Some guy was hawking fleshlights as a way to get over horniness without having to deal with women.  I said that it's possible to have relationships with women without marrying them or engaging in a LTR and called OP an incel because he is.  Not Reddit's ""If you point out sexism against men you are an incel"" definition but the actual definition.  


I'd been lurking there off and on for a while.  But the bullshit's gotten out of hand.  Yeah, there are a lot of shitty women out there, but I'm old enough and experienced enough to recognize red flags and avoid them.  Most of the posters there see fake red flags everywhere.  


Reddit's just an echo chamber.  I remember on an old account I got banned from /r/conservative for calling out anti-Trump conservatives prior to the election.  Then later I got banned from /r/The_Donald for criticizing a couple of Trump's policies.  I got banned from /r/news even though I never posted there.  I got banned from /r/datingoverthirty for going against the grain when there was a ""single moms are so strong"" circlejerk."
724,"I know /r/mgtow got quarantined, but I really hope they don't flood this sub.  This sub is about living your life single, not about complaining about women.  Although the titles are similar, the theme is very different."
725,"I have always been intrigued by the philosophy of MGTOW and the main subreddit. I myself am 18, and have an amazing girlfriend who I intend to marry, however I understand why you would not want to get married in today’s modern society. 

I got banned months ago, because I kept seeing misogynistic comments and I kept replying to them pointing out the hate and the sexism. I could view posts but I couldn’t comment and I couldn’t keep looking at all of the misogyny and hate without being able to reply to it. 

I found this sub a few days ago when I learned that the main sub was finally quarantined. This place has little misogyny, and seems way more focused on self improvement, and actually understands treating everyone with kindness and compassion. Just because you don’t want to date and marry women does not mean that all women are hateful, life-destroying feminazis from hell. 

Thank you to all of you respectful MGTOWs out there who are doing the right thing. Women are great. The divorce and court systems are not. Going your own way literally means choosing your own path in life, which means you shouldn’t be criticising others for not following your particular path."
726,Wait did not we have a mega thread for that already?
727,rule 8
728,"I haven't been banned, because I don't post there. I read their BS sometimes to understand their perspective though. Basically, they just want to have their bitterness/hatred affirmed by other males who feel the same way. It's one big, depressing circle-jerk. It must be a sad life, to go there and engage because it's the only place you feel validated. Pathetic, really.

Then, there's the female version... How many of these places exist?

Edit: These people just needed a friend to tell them...give it time and it'll happen/you will meet someone. I didn't have sex as early as a lot of people. I remember some athletes at 16 and then through high school everybody acted like they were having sex. I'm glad I never got any STDs or had any kids too early for me to handle. I eventually blossomed. Everyone does...except these losers. I wish I could reach them but they're done listening."
729,I was banned for posting the net worth of Megan Markle. Noooooo idea why what was drama for them.
730,i got banned because i dared to ask why so much harmless post get deleted by the mods xD
731,"Got banned from mgtow for trying to show fellow men a subreddit that is hateful towards men and believes in Wicca and that their magic tricks can solve the issue of the “Patriarchy”. Asked EXTREMELY POLITELY what proper steps I could take to remove the ban, as I thoroughly supported the movement of mgtow and punishment for false rape accusers. Never got a response. Low key glad mgtow got quarantined. It was filled with overflow users from r/incels and mods were becoming corrupt.

TLDR: Nothing new, just reddit being reddit. What goes around comes around."
732,I wasnt on reddit for 6 months like what happened?
733,"I don’t even know what I did?? I’m just now realizing I’ve been banned upon entering this post. Damn, anyone know how I can find out what I did??"
734,"Today is Valentine, so I open my reddit to see what my MGTOW brother's are posting. I figure out I was banned!!!"
735,Banned for (reasons?)
736,"Was banned a week or so ago and given no reason. If karma is anything to go by I was one of the ""popular"" posters there."
737,I got banned for doing literally nothing but upvoting good posts. Can't believe it.
738,[deleted]
739,I ask a question about manginas killing themselves over women that already have a boy''friend''.
740,"Got banned for saying my opinion reddit mods are assholes, stay in your echo chamber pussy"
741,"Didn’t the subreddit get deleted by the big giant heads, I may be confusing it with twitter but not sure.  It doesn’t come up on a search"
742,"All the mods are scumbags incels in they feelings "" TOO MUCH FEMALE ENERGY IN THEY BLOOD. ""  Real man not suppose to have that much bitch ass energy/ in they damn feelings about post !"
743,I asked a guy on MGTOW if he was gay because he was bashing women through and through and I got banned. Maybe it was deserved.
744,"I got banned from posting a link to a travel blog on reddit itself, that had the photo of the hottest post from a mgtow who said they visited there and took the photo himself... ""Go your own way brothers.""

It's amazing. I got banned and called a SJW. Haha."
745,Banned for this today[my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/fn303r/i_dont_care_about_you_or_you_fatherless_spawn/fl8evnl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
746,What is this sub about i also got banned from Mgtow because I pointed out a discrepancy in someone’s wishlist and he called me a simp I called him incel then got banned two hours later but seriously explain to me what you think of MGTOW what is all this about
747,"Just got banned for saying [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/frvmpp/china_is_asshole/flzgn2e/?context=3) has nothing to do with MGTOW. It's a purely political post. I've said way more controversial things than this, too. Really surprised this is what it took for them to ban me.

For reference, I've contributed to the community on a daily basis, and garnered over 30k comment karma from that sub alone. It's also the only sub I browse (apart from this). Really surprised they think banning me will do anything LOL. My reddit account doesn't mean shit to me; I'm not stuck in the matrix ;)."
748,"Someone posted on the subreddit trashing K-pop groups for wearing makeup on stage calling it the results of women's drive to feminize men and all that BS, calling them Simps and shit. Now I didnt care incredibly much about K-pop I'll admit, but what I did care about, and I felt was worth discussing is the stigma behind makeup itself and masculinity, and how just because someone wears makeup to enhance their features and cover imperfections so they'd feel more confident about themselves doesnt make them less manly or a simp or a fag (a word I saw frequently in the comments) because there are plenty of perfectly good (and straight) dudes who rock a face of natural makeup. It was a stupid argument I'll admit, and I regret getting involved in it, however i dont I deserved a ban. Especially since the way I see it, a man going his own way to feel confident about himself in whatever ways he sees fit whether it be regular gym visits or regular sephora visits without worrying about what other think is a fairly MGTOW concept."
749,"Left a comment on mgtow and got banned

So someone posted a picture of baby yoda saying he was born a mgtow and I explain that there is no such thing only incels are born that way. I explained that Incels love to claim mgtow cause they can’t get women but the women they do they will become a fierce little male feminist and will turn on mgtow. I know this cause I seen it with my own eyes and for saying this I was ban.  Luckily I used a throwaway account but wow I can’t believe that mgtow defends incels as if we are all incels if I wanted to be part of a incel community then I would but then again I can’t cause I’m not ugly or fat or short so I don’t fall under any of those categories. The reason why I’m a mgtow is cause I been with too many women and they are all the same. Incels want to believe they are truly mgtows but are you truly a mgtow if you never even experienced betrayed by a women? Dated one after finding mgtow and realizing that everything said her is true? Maybe is just me. 

Ps don’t ban cause I’m not a fucking incel. I’m a mgtow but not a incel."
750,"Who is that loser who bans people Don't tell me I now know who it is. I suspected it was him , And it seems he is ""some rich dweeb who can't get his dick sucked"". Now it all adds up."
751,"I made comments about pro-circumcision purely from health point of view and got lambasted for my opinion. I think a lot of foreskin lovers cannot accept different opinions, even though the scientific evidence is overwhelming on the benefits of circumcision. I think  prejudice still pervades because circumcision are common practices for Jews and Muslims and therefore it will always be viewed with biasses. I was banned for my opinion. I suppose the mod must be foreskin lover MGTOW."
752,I simply mentioned that most of them have not gone their own way. They’ve replaced dating women and being taken advantage of with using all of their energy with resenting them. Moving on is moving on. They’re out of sight out of mind. It shouldn’t mean you become more obsessed. And I was banned
753,I just got banned from mgtow because I said the sub has become full of incel hating idiots.
754,"i got banned for posting in purplepilldebate. mods on the original mgtow sub seriously all have sticks up their arses lmao, why make a sub if you're going to ban your users permanently for stuff that isnt even in the rules/sidebar 😂

making up rules at your own discretion instead of amending the sub rules; thats some feminine shit right there. probably FGTOWS in disguise or something. or some seriously massive egos, inflated with the sticks up their arses. fuck knows. but im thankful for /r/mgtow2 . 

&#x200B;

\>  We do not want to degenerate into a negativity echochamber. 

Love this 👌"
755,They banned me for promoting homosexuality. I'm straight. Those guys are *really* conservative
756,"Beaned for calling out misogyny, my comment had like 20 upvoted lmao"
757,Hot banned because i commented on a meme showing females in burkas was freedom. I commented saying no burkhas are not freedom. Banned. Appealed and was ignored. Fucking tosser mods
758,Got banned for asking about wanting to live life with a kid or two but without a wife. Like wtf MGTOW
759,I got banned for saying that telling women that they should have kids asap because their best years for statistically having the best chance at healthy offspring is probably not the best idea. That along with welfare(single moms make up 75% of welfare) are contributing to young single moms which lowers the pool of women men would want to date.
760,"I haveb een banned again. This is my third time. The mod I had reached out to last time suggested I just create a new account so I did, and it's been less than a week, I've only gained 100 karma, and I'm already banned. No idea why. I refused to even get into disagreements this time, but it looks like asking for male only movies and making the title a tongue in cheek 'sexist movie club suggestions' was enough to do it."
761,"I recently posted something I seriously needed for my gender equality school report. Since MGTOW supported men, I asked about what the men of that sub thought regarding forced and toxic masculinity, and their personal experiences regarding it. I just asked. That's it. 2 mins later, I got banned - straight after a bunch of dudes flamed the comments, angry at feminists and somehow missing the whole point of the question being for my freaking school report. I'm not sure if anyone else will be willing to share feedback at this point, or also downvote me to hell lmao"
762,I thought why was my feed so pg lately. So some „ People“ decided we were too toxic or what? Gosh darn were alll only gentlemen in here who have enough of woman. It sometimes feels like People think were dangerous because of our un soceieterian beleves...
763,I was just looking at my post history and I barely realized that the MGTOW page(thread) is not there anymore. That's crazy how it's taken down very quick.
764,Lol I got banned from a comment. I don't even remember what I said cuz it got deleted
765,"Yeah, I got banned ages ago.. Not quite sure why.. Weird!"
766,"[Comment that got me banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/cq6byj/preferences_is_pure_bigotry/ewuih3w?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

Looks like they don't understand sarcasm."
767,"https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/ez6vpv/french_firefighters_in_paris_today_looking_like_a/fglhlcd?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
Really? Firefighter protests aren't a gendered issue."
768,"Some dude linked a post that he said he hasn't read yet, it was a post promoting gender equality. He didn't get banned.  But I did because I told him to""be careful what you link"""
769,Skywilder 👏 BALLS. 👍
770,"They aren't cheering that the site is being banned for being anti women, they are saying that the site bans them for not being anti woman enough. Is that too hard for you to understand? Most successful people dont like to be told what to do . The site claims to be all about men succeeding. But it seems they want psychopaths and dumbfu#ks on their site instead. For some of the cretins on that site, emptying their bowels without it being in their pants is a success. And noone wants to be told what to do by Dumb Donut"
771,They close you get the louder they are...
772,So MGTOW nowadays is about bitching like a feminist but in opposite direction. What a joke.
773,this is exactly where I got my username from; calling out racism on the sub and getting banned.
774,"If you don't worship Trump or say a PURELY political post doesn't belong in /r/mgtow, they'll ban you for that shit. Just happened to me, despite contributing to the sub on a daily basis. I have over 30k karma from that sub alone. 

Oh well, I'm not stuck in the matrix, I'll find my way around ;)"
775,"Yeah I got banned for something similar. Someone was insulting the fact that AOC (who I don't even like) is *just a bartender* (which is totally false, she's a congresswoman now) and I said it would be like insulting Trump because he's *just a TV show guy* (which is also false, he's the president now).

Here is the comment:

https://old.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/ekenqp/the_word_men_is_missing_from_this_because_men/fdb5vf4/

TL;DR - there must be a real fag in the MGTOW mod team. I bet he rides a harley too."
776,I think those girls over at /r/mgtow are definitly mods.
777,"Yeah I think you’re right. Alt right redditors managed to take over subs by infiltration, somehow banned other mods and poisoned them. Now incels have done the same to r/MGTOW."
778,same
779,the #2 mod on the list.
780,How do you tell which moderator banned you?
781,"seems like it has become a MAGA sub. Any opinion criticizing Trump is downvoted to the abyss or even banned. They pretend they're going their own way but they fantazise about a conservative society and obssess about ""owning the libs""."
782,"Yep. They trigger easily to anything that doesn't conform exactly to their belief system. I don't get it. MGTOW should be for every man to understand as a lifestyle or philosophy to live by if they so choose. Everyone guy will have his own version of MGTOW, it doesn't have to be one-size-fits-all. 

Very limited thinking over there."
783,"You're right. ""Calling attention to"" something =/= hate. 

Here's the rub. It is *easy* to bitch about something that bothers you. It often takes much more introspection and thought to come up with a solution. 

Here, this sub is aimed as representing the positive sides of mgtow. What is can do *for* a man, vs just complaining about women. 

Now, maybe by tightening things up on the posting guidelines, the sub might shrink. I'm good with that if what does get posted is positive and helps men show their accomplishments, or have meaningful discussions focusing on living a full and satisfying life vs complaining about the ""nature of wahmen"" and such. 

Jokes and memes and posts bitching about women have their place, it's just not this sub, and to allow the posts that focus on women or ""calling then out"", just detracts from the goal of this sub."
784,LOL
785,/r/askTRP
786,"Yours is the first username, ever, I have actually been envious of."
787,[deleted]
788,[deleted]
789,"Yep, there might be some sort of trojan takeover there. They're going very aggressive woman hating to the max."
790,"Lol, cunts they are. It's a very specialized word."
791,"They won't respond, they are bigots whose belief system is based on hate, which they can't admit, so they just ban you and don't say why."
792,"""all pants are the same""

>_pants are pants_"
793,"At least you got a response. Most of the time they are scared to say why a person was banned. I was banned after I told someone that hate is a bad thing for many reasons. First, it means that you care and that you're giving power to the other person. It also isn't good to let hate rule your life because it's unhealthy. 

They absolutely couldn't have that, I suppose. I was banned with no explanation because their a bunch of scared little bitches that can't actually admit to their hate or they'll be quarantined. So they won't say anything,just ban people with no explanation."
794,"I actually got banned without reason. Don’t even know why. I asked, they never answered.
Drives me mad, face to face, they couldn’t be able to ghost and would need to face repercussions."
795,"Tbh fat shaming of either gender should be acceptable, unless there's a health issue"
796,How do you know for sure it's not healthy though? I've heard some cancer and AIDS patients had a good result from steroids.
797,Same for everyone here.  Nobody ever gets an explanation from the mods.
798,"I think you're confusing mgtow with mra's.

Mgtow gives zero shits about any of that. It is what it is and we're perfectly content to walk away from it, and the culture that goes with. 

I have no bitterness towards women or feminists. Their bullshit doesnt stop me from getting laid as I please, without having to compromise my own self-interest, and no risk of sexual harassment or divorce rape.

I just go to other places where the cancer of femenism has not spread. 

If you want to change laws and have some sort of ""come together"" moment, you are in the wrong place. 

We dont care. We're finding our own way to happiness and satisfaction in life. We've figured it out that quite simply, we dont need women. 

Go in peace."
799,"They're transphobic, homophobic, sexist, etc......... They can't outright say that but they adhere to hateful ideas pretty firmly, IMO. The thing is, MGTOW can do so much good for men, especially young men, that it doesn't need the bigoted element to be important in a man's life. 

Ultimately, they're giving true MGTOW a bad name."
800,They banned me because I don't hate women and I simply don't want to commit to a relationship
801,"Wait, what? They should've made you a mod."
802,The irony is that some insoles want to be a part of the LGBT community because they see themselves as a “depressed“
803,"r/braincels is gone too, but a lot of them mocked r/mgtow, so, I don't know."
804,How long ago was that sub shut down?
805,"Don't worry, it's better here and it will only get better. Content and discussion will win the day. I'd rather read a few quality posts than endless streams of women hating rhetoric. I know dogs bite, some more than others... I still like dogs."
806,[deleted]
807,"That's stupid. I think r/MGTOW2 is going to be the best MGTOW sub, it leaves all the petty bs out of it."
808,"That's terrible. I think women should know about MGTOW and understand why it's important for men to be MGTOW. Not because men and women need to hate each other (we don't), men just need to be aware of how society views them and how to mitigate society's negative influence on their lives. 

Instead, the focus is on hate and negativity. It could be so much better but the mods are children that can't see the big picture."
809,That's crazy damn
810,Same here.
811,Just make another account
812,What.
813,"Before you get married, can you talk to your parents about putting your inheritance in a non revocable trust? That will be your best bet even if the judge decides to puss out and award her everything. You’ll still keep all your assets and she can kick rocks if it ever comes to a split."
814,"You have a female username and are suggesting marriage as a viable option in a MGTOW forum. That's like going to a Christian forum and saying worshiping Satan is a viable option, you just need to do it right.

In case you didn't know, prenups are non-deterministic and regularly thrown out of court and are not respected, because basically men are not respected. All the woman needs is a good lawyer and you may as well wipe your ass with the paper the prenup was written on. It's like telling a man to wear a kevlar vest in case of getting hit with a round of .50 BMG.

Marriage of any form is not an option for a man, especially when there is zero benefits that can't also be attained outside of marriage anyway. Sex, LTR, children etc... all can be attained outside of marriage in greater amounts and with less costs and much less risk."
815,Its true tho
816,"Wow, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/ew3df6/this_is_why_i_went_mgtow/ffzle6y/) there before I got banned without given a reason or recourse."
817,"Yep, mgtow on reddit is full of foamy mouthed haters. Plenty of women are bad, but there's also a lot of truly sht males that get turfed out of relationships... and there's an abundance on that channel."
818,[deleted]
819,"It sounds like they're only interested in a very small, exclusive, but extreme group. That's infantile.

MGTOW is for every man, with whatever his other views may be. They are limiting themselves, and their limits are defined by their hate and intolerance of even remotely diverging opinions. 

F'ing losers."
820,I hope so too buddy
821,"It's too bad. MGTOW is so important, especially for boys and young men just starting out and needing to understand how society views them. That sub is literally f'ing it all up. 

In fact, it really **isn't** MGTOW. They should have to rename their sub."
822,"Practically the same thing over here.

No need to exclude half the population over something one nasty person did."
823,"I mean, it's not that big a deal, I guess. The only reason I mention it at all is because I've been a member of mgtow1 since there were less than 8000 members.... Maybe that's why, actually. No one wants some old fart trying to steer the discussion back to the meat and potatoes of mgtow philosophy. I mean, God forbid we talk about something other than memes."
824,"it looks like you did 'white knighting' but what you really were doing was defending statistical analysis

men in general like logical stuff so (if you want back in the club) just put it that way"
825,They trigger easily.
826,"Then we should ban Leonidas of Sparta, all the Romans, the Scots and any other skirt wearing sissies too. Amen.

828,I got banned for saying Islam was right about women.

833,Same. Quarantined.
834,Well they do say MOTHER nature after all.
835,"Well, I'd say that because she was a girl it DID make a difference. I'm not even being sexist about that, identify other young people who've gained public awareness on these sorts of matters and you'll find they're girls as well. What about that one that addressed the UN on feminism etc"
836,Reddit has a lot of irrational bigots. Don't let it get you down :)
837,Are you a mgtow trans male?
838,[deleted]
839,But... But... That *is* MGTOW
840,"I agree with you, some of them just want to hate on women."
841,I just got banned for pointing out the differences between men going their own way and blaming the Chinese for coronavirus
842,i get the venting from guys but some of it is just crazy shit that makes no sense. like hating on a race that has nothing to do with relationships
843,"These motherfuckers love America, whilst shitting on the government and American culture...whilst praising American culture. Confused bunch of cuckerators over there.

I just don't want political posts to pollute the essence of the sub."
844,Can't see it on mobile
845,"Thanks, but it has been up here for a year and a half, we just have to make a new one every six months because of auto-archiving."
846,What idiots.
847,Two words: Princess Leia
848,"To your point on Star Wars, I’d argue it is also the level of pandering and agenda pushing of 8 that also hurt, the assault on the Fans and then the overall Disney attitude. I think it’s a mix of all three. But you don’t deserve a ban just for disagreeing with someone over Pop culture."
849,It's quite ironic that MGTOW is banning people  while complaining about being banned from other reddit forums.
850,"Yes. I got banned for making a Jesus joke. 

MGTOW snowflakes can dish it out but not so good at taking it..."
851,"Curious what the specifics were.   I've most certainly noticed how very vocal they right wing presence there is, but if they are banning you from calling it out, that makes me think the mods are very much happy with that fact, or even fanning the flames perhaps.   

The worst example to me on there of it is the anti-Greta stuff.   Very naive to have a negative attitude of her."
852,Same
853,"yup, same here.    It's like the idiot Freeper brownshirts moved in and took over.   Problem is, to anyone looking at MGTOW we are all lumped in together, the freakshow at MGTOW1 and us here at MGTOW2."
854,Unfortunately bigotry against different groups drives most of their censorship. They are also against diversity of viewpoints. So they are as censorious or more than most SJW or feminist subs.
855,What is a waatgm?
856,Mgtow community has been banned from Reddit. Quarantined.  Well deserved!!!
857,on mgtow1? really?
858,You must have committed a pre crime.
859,"Do you know why?

That place was a haven"
860,"i think its because mgtow is overly toxic, but idk why subs like mgtow on the feminist side aren’t quarantined"
861,Refer to the quarantine thread at the top of the sub. A link is there.
862,They love going their own way so much they want to buttfuck about it.
863,French-fry?
864,Beats run Reddit.
865,"Same. No idea why I was banned, I can still see posts though"
866,that's because it's quarantined.
867,"That was banned too damn, men really oppressed"
868,They’ll do the same with any feminist sub that is frequented thousands of times by some loser who wants to kill as many people as possible.
869,">chinese dudes fucking bats. 

Christ, that takes the cake for stupid shit said about coronavirus."
870,"Just make another account bro, who cares lol. It's just Reddit. The posts and discussion on that sub is good enough to keep browsing. Keep calling bullshit whenever you see it. Apparently their hate for China and the Chinese is too great for any logic to penetrate their small brains."
871,">I had a long standing account that was active weekly with good feedback banned without explanation.

Alright, well that's it, then.  I mean, what else can one do? At least there's some comfort in knowing that I'm in good company.  There seems to be no rhyme, nor reason to this."
872,"I got banned a while ago lol. It was liberating. I don’t have enough time in my day to try to convince those guys over there that channeling their energies towards productivity and satisfaction is more useful than lounging around in bitterness, hatred and resentment."
873,"Aunt Karen is a term meaning you want to speak to the manager or appeal to a higher authority about matters.

I guess these clowns don’t want anything other than total subservience. It’s very much like r/The_Donald where questioning the party line means you’re out of the club.

BTW I got banned from The_Donald for telling a user to use a space bar and not write walls of text. No joke 😂"
874,"Posts get removed, and then a user is subsequently banned. It's how a lot of subs work. You see the reported/offending post, remove it quickly, then take whatever action is deemed necessary against the poster."
875,Wonder if she is still in the bed.
876,[deleted]
877,lol what!? At this point I suspect there has to be a saboteur. No one's that retarded.
878,"theyve got so much time on their hands they go through users post history, and randomly ban people if they think they don't fit in with mgtows ideology i guess. in their mind they're probably not doing it randomly. but sadly, their egos are way to massive. and they make assumptions, prob why they cant get girls aswell. either that or its being modded by paranoid schizophrenics"
879,Mgtow is basically an incel sub. Alot of incels flooded the sub when the incel sub got nuked.
880,"I disagree with that assessment. 

You're combining two different things.

Men who desire women but cant ""get"" them are involuntary celibate men aka incels or omega males etc. 

Mgtow men are men who *could* (and in the vast majority of cases, have) had women, and were often married, but have been burned by the courts in a divorce or seen how society supports the word of a woman in judgement versus the evidence given by a man. 

Both men may be angry, but incels *stay* angry. 

Men going their own way have decided that they want to simply walk away from the laws, gynocentric society, and drama that marriage and formal relationships bring."
881,"I stumbled on this because someone mentioned that the sub FDS is like a female MGTOW, and boy, having looked at both, it makes me feel almost sick. I want to be able to individually sit people down and explain why a lot of this is plain wrong, because trying to approach the topic would probably get me kicked here, and men aren't allowed on FDS anyway ha."
882,"? What's a snitch mod? Arent mods the people you ""snitch"" to?"
883,The snitch mod probably banned you whilst frantically trying to stop the droplets of piss running down his/her leg from hitting the floor with their other hand.
884,Wat?
885,"I don't agree with you on the nofap thing being a requirement for MGTOW. It's my belief that each MGTOW lives a version of MGTOW that's right for him. 

But you should **never** have been banned for sharing your opinion. Bunch of scared kids over there. Scared of ideas too."
886,"The problem is a lot of them are mgtow because they have no choice.  They have to go their own way because no woman wants to be with them because of their anti female attitude.   True meaning of incel.

I got called an incel because I didn't agree with a teenager that happened to be female getting away with possessing alcohol out in the open by a cop.
I said it was a perfect time for her to learn a lesson and hopefully it doesn't lead to her drinking and driving.
I was downvoted to hell and called an incel"
887,eventually male spaces that have large followings will be banned unfortunately
888,"You are still young, brother! Probably that is why you see women as being great. I have no problem with that, it's your life, your choices, you know what's best for you. At your age I was the same, after I got to college, I started to see life as it really is once I got to live on my own.

The only woman great in my life is my mother. She loves me like no woman will ever love me. The other women in my life? They were great as long as I was providing. Men love women and women love children. A woman will never love a man the way he expects it. That's a fact and a sad one. For me at least as I was growing up believing in romantic love.

Many guys on the other mgtow forum, probably bought this idea as well and went through divorce. You say that divorce and court system suck, but think about it: isn't it the women who get bored or whatever reason make the first step for the divorce?"
889,"Yes, but posts get auto-archived after 180 days to they have to be remade in order to still take commentary."
890,"Please explain how this breaks the rule 8?

This thread is specifically set up so people CAN discuss the ongoing moderation tactic of ""perma-ban as a first response"" that seems to go on there which leaves users probably confused and rightfully miffed a bit.  Its here so the sub is not over-the with ""banned from mgtow"" stories."
891,"The ""rules"" is a wall of text without numeration."
892,Last year I got banned from mgtow too. In there banned email to me it said “if you got banned then change your ways.” Sounded like femanazi bs to me. And there was no chance for redemption. But I look today and there is no more r/mgtow. What happened to it?
893,Reddit is still ebola G.
894,"I’m researching and inspecting it and it looks like a femcunt or undercover Male feminist snuck their way into R/MGTOW as Mods and are literally fucking shit up from the inside: banning folk and quarantining the place. 

I could be wrong."
895,"I looked at your post history and realised why you were banned. It was a misunderstanding. 12 days ago you made a response about circumcision. That you had studied psychology and it makes sense. You meant the previous comment made sense and they thought you meant circumcision made sense. Someone made a negative comment about your post, you got downvoted and your post was removed. The mod that removed your comment i guess also  banned you. Maybe it was a temporary ban for 7 days or something  I don't know. Try making a comment there and see if it is accepted or not. It weird getting banned from any sub with being given a reason."
896,Were they anti-incel posts?
897,"That's actually hilarious, someone is actually so triggered by your upvotes he has to ban you"
898,What exactly is the quarantine about?
899,Reference the quarantine mega thread at the top of the sub herem
900,Shaming language
901,"Yeah, I can kinda see why you got banned. If you’re gonna try to counter a guys “female bashing”(whatever the claims may be) You don’t use shaming language, ie: “Who hurt you?” “are you gay” etc. it’s the easiest way to get dismissed in an argument with red pill men, as those tactics are usually conducted by blue pill simps or women."
902,"At one point they even attacked me for my own sexuality, which is very out of line tbh. Being Bisexual, or even being gay for that matter doesn't make someone less of a man. For a group of people who are so anti women I was quite shocked with the amount of adversity towards queer men."
903,"Tl;dr you know the feminisation of corean males was done intentionally, right? Educate yourself fool. 🤣"
904,What is the definition of incel 👀
905,"i guess god fucked up then and the jews and muslims are kind of confused...

perfect being....yet requires you to cut off a standard part he made to be “clean”

or maybe you could just wash your dickhole and hood🤷🏻‍♂️your opinion is wrong."
906,"Put it this way, friend.


If you wanted to cut off your foreskin as an adult who has some say over his body, go nuts. Your body, your choice. 


I think the thing most people object to is tying a newborn baby boy down to a table and cutting off part of his genitals without his consent or even anesthesia.


Like it's not ok to do to girls but it is ok to do to boys? How does this not traumatize them?


Usually its men who were circumcised and agreed to let their own children get cut without being aware of how the procedure occurs and then find out how it's done that defend the procedure the hardest."
907,Sounds like their denial is strong.
908,"As a conservative, I want it to be known that we are NOT MGTOW. Those guys are something else."
909,Cause im sure you go on feminist subs and call out misandry too.
910,They're a bunch of bitchy children over there.
911,"> forced and toxic masculinity

you need banned from this galaxy"
912,"There absolutely is toxic masculinity. It can happen in all kinds of forms when there are no good rolemodels. It's just important to differentiate that there is a dichotomy of good and bad masculinity, just as good and bad femininity. Else some may run with the idea that all masculinity is toxic.

I wish you good luck on that report."
913,"> the question being for my freaking school report

Possibly being that you are a minor.  The user agreement indicates that you have to be older than 13 to use the site.  There are some websites that will ban you outright if you're a minor.

https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement"
914,"yeah fuck you and that virtue signaling other men and basically getting easy points from female teachers by presenting something about toxic masculinity, bullshit you deserved to be banned from all mgtow."
915,"You can go your own way without being hateful.  

MGTOW went from being a positive group where men could talk about and show off the great lives and things they did when they refused the lives society demanded of them,then turned into something gross.

By the end, that sub had become just as toxic as r/incels."
916,What?? Just read the comments man. All the simps saying they are happy its banned because the page was “misogynist”. I think its you who doesn’t understand.
917,Yeah... I'm kinda sad about the downturn it's taken...
918,"This reply to your comment:


Trump was a famous billionaire playboy. He literally won life and was the man everyone aspired to be, that gives him intrinsic respect, it shows he is good at life.

AOC was in indebted bartender. She was comically bad at life, working a job anyone can get with debt. She was poor and so bad at life she’d probably starve to death if not for the government.

Why should we take advice from someone who is so bad at life they would starve to death? This is how a country turns to breadlines.

__________

How is this real?"
919,"Yeah, it’s become a weird pro-Trump anti-woman circle jerk"
920,Facts bro
921,"True. It just annoys me that mgtow1 is the only safehaven left for men to vent about their past experiences and hypocrisy of women.

Then people call us misogynists and toxic but totally ignores subreddits like FDS, that totally suggest to manipulate and take advantages of men. 

But oh no these aren't toxic, nobody bats an eye. Lol

I think it's a great idea to separate mgtow with mgtow2. What I find unfortunate is that there's a lot of shit talking back and forth between the two when we should empower and encourage each other"
922,Facts
923,"Lol.  Thanks homie.  ""TheHypnicJerk"" and all the good variations of ""JackBurton"" were all taken and this one just kinda popped into my head at the right time."
924,"I suggested consensual sex between heterosexual equals. Silly me.

I always feel weird in MGTOW forums because I don’t actually hate women. I just work hard to avoid typical female bullshit and cut any women out of my life who try to do it. Like, I won’t ever marry again, I won’t date someone financially less secure than me and I won’t give in to emotional manipulation."
925,Oh I get it. They'll go way too far hating women and get the entire sub banned from reddit altogether.
926,"I'm noticing a lot of deleted posts there. I recently posted about fucking the police, maybe it's that.

I've openly said on that sub, many times in the past, that I'm left-wing, even ran for office, am brown and anti-trump. It never was an issue until now.

Ima side with the people who are saying this is a hostile takeover.

Edit: hell, the reason I'm even there is because of 50+ false accusations."
927,Facts bro
928,Sandwiches are sandwiches
929,"But the question is: why?

One thing I’ve learned from MGTOW, in my very young mind, is why should I give a shit if it has nothing to do with me? If it’s a family member, a healthy discussion or intervention about obesity is acceptable because it’s a loved one that could die as a result. I don’t see the point in making comments about a stranger’s weight. It doesn’t concern me, so there’s no point in me commenting. I’ve just learned to keep public remarks to myself unless somebody asks for my own opinion."
930,"Those are corticosteroids, which are different from anabolic steroids, which is what athletes use. Corticosteroids can help some forms of cancer and help other things like asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. The guy who I was talking to took anabolic steroids because he said that “it’s the key to longevity” despite multiple studies showing how it can lead to cardiovascular disease and mental disorders."
931,"the saying is true:  absolute power = absolute corruption. 

When mods are given the power to silence anyone,  they will do so without impunity.  

And they wonder why people are saying MGTOW is the male version of feminism."
932,"I'm talking about the first MGTOW subreddit, not here. Here isn't toxic and nor is MensRights and what you said is perfectly true."
933,And they’re racist bc ultimately things always resort back to “Tyrone” and women having mixed race babies. Pretty sad.
934,"It's sad, i was really proud of this community but after seeing so many stupid ideas based on nothing besides hatred I feel this is just another group of sad men that prefer to despise everyone else instead of changing themselves.
I hope I'm wrong."
935,"nope, mgtow is a reaction to all the cultural marxism you tacitly support in your statements. there would be no need for it as without all those fake “phobias” and the authoritarian hold with which they pervade society, you wouldnt need to be walking away from women or turtling from society. if they hadnt been empowered to destroy you with ease by invoking these ideals, mgtow would be spurious.

society is going to call your spitroasted brand of mgtow sexist, homophobic and transphobic regardless, because you support mens partial evasion of the system, which gives them carte blanche to pull a donald sutherland in the body snatchers."
936,Same here. Was responding to some extremists talking about shunning off all women & then brought race into it.
937,You simply can’t say anything remotely towards the incels there.
938,"I don't think it's terrible. Just extremely childish and weak. To me this is on the same level as a guy who punches another guy in the face just because he doesn't like the other ones opinion or can't disprove what has been said. I didn't even reply to the notification because I knew this would be a battle that's not worth to be fought and I have bigger problems that require my energy. 

Your right. It's time that women learn about the reasons why more and more men are disinterested in marriage, having own kids or just being in a relationship. It doesn't have to be in a way that tells us ""you're all a bunch of disgusting evil shits without morals and the only way you're good for is to wreck a men."" more like ""hey. No need to be mad. It's just that the current laws disadvantages us and we don't want to risk losing our money and even freedom. It's just self defense that, hopefully, sounds logical to you."" just to answer some questions other women might have. 
I understand your reasons why you avoid women in the way you do and I feel really bad for you. If it would be men who could completely destroy me after divorcing I would want to stay away from them as well. 

Let's just hope that government wakes up, changes the laws that allow women to ruin their men if they divorce and starts letting men keep their money and property and treats them equally to women when the question who gets the custody over the kids needs to be answered. Society could be so much better if this change takes place."
939,"I posted my comment and a minute later my Reddit app notified me I was banned from the page permanently ,  I'm very disappointed with the page instead of promoting ways for men to make money or become self reliant , it takes jabs at women , dudes post flow charts to point out statistics from dating apps and all this Incel woman hating behavior."
940,Yea some douche said that women are all liars and it's all false accusations and I said that I am sure that there are some that are telling the truth so he called me a white knight lol it was funny
941,"I agree with you. There is no value in getting married. I am a woman, and completely agree with the point of MGTOW. I have a 20 year old son whom I’m trying to get to adopt the MGTOW mindset. He hooks up with any girl that will have him...then gets destroyed when he gets tossed aside. This has given me a HUGE wake up call when it comes to the mindset of Millennial women. I’m just worried he’s going to knock up one of these LVW, and get wrecked by the child support machine. He just doesn’t seem like he knows how to be happy with himself...thinks he NEEDS another half to make him whole. I’m single for life, by choice...I suppose the women version of MGTOW. The only part I don’t like about the main MGTOW group is that a lot of them seem to actually hate women, and revel in fucking them over. Personally, I wish marriage didn’t exist."
942,"Some humans are just shit humans, period. Despite gender. They can’t see through their own rage to realize that."
943,It almost sounds like that sub got usurped by a bunch of chicks?
944,"And they characterize us in the process. 

It's good to be covert in today's age."
945,"If that's what passes for white-knighting, no thank you. Talk about being overly sensitive..."
946,I remember that. Good times.
947,Playstations = you hate women
948,"Congratulations, you done playstationed yourself."
949,Happy cake day.
950,I tried to check it out through google and I was able to access it (while being banned) but I can't make any posts. I think only people still subbed to it can post and you simply can't find it through reddit. Which is weird.
951,Wow what retards in the comment. Same for the article.
952,"Thanks,I'll check it out!"
953,yeah it was just funny to me. i don't really care about it. it changes nothing in my life.
954,"Yeah, I’ve basically fully transitioned and I consider myself a mgtow"
955,Does this men you were born as a male and now you are a female or you were born as a female and now are a male?
956,"Thanks, I’m glad! :)"
957,And not focusing on themselves or art.
958,"Someone posted a picture of 85 year old actress Brigitte Bardot next to a picture of her from 1960, talking about how hard she hit the wall.  I essentially said it was ridiculous.  Lots of upvotes, but it was wrong think, so banned!"
959,"I saw it, on mobile"
960,"Methinks you should set the thread to show new replies by default, otherwise the newer voices won't be heard."
961,"Yup. I had no problem pointing that out either, which sometimes caused them to back off, just like claiming free speech and right to do as one wants to. It's a bit of a trapping point, as they can't claim to advocate men doing their own thing, their own way, but then cherry pick things to censor when they see fit, so then they either angrily bite their tongue and say OK or go the hypocrite route and expose that they don't actually allow for true freedom."
962,Where are all the good men
963,r/whereareallthegoodmen
964,yep
965,Wheres his Minority Report??
966,"Allow me.

#^FAGGOT"
967,"Yeah they were obviously eating them as a luxury that the Chinese govt was supposed to take away, and ended up being strong armed by the rich. 😂"
968,True. Life is life. Thanks bro. We shouldn’t let other small brainers infiltrate our happiness or sabotage our beliefs.
969,[deleted]
970,yeah...i mean for the most part i tried to be positive or productive if you peep my post history. Not sure which one got me kicked.
971,"Wow, that's ridiculous. It's like they're always on the verge of explosion and the slightest tickle they mistake for nuclear assault.

Thanks for responding to me by the way. I had never been banned before anywhere and it really shocked me. I can't say I'm glad I'm not alone, but it does make me feel a little better knowing it's not just me"
972,">My theory is that it isn't the bluepillers who've taken over. It's some SJWesque group that wants to drive out non-rational, peaceful discussion in order to create a new r/incels and thereby discredit the concept of MGTOW.

>It's a typical Fifth Column action.

This is happening to all of Reddit."
973,yeah I think reddit admins have infiltrated that sub
974,Yeah I understand the difference
975,"Tbf this sub is no where near as bad as the original; there's alot to disagree on with peoples opinions but eh. Least it's not the original where they are all on their high horse, think striking fear into women is tool to be used etc..."
976,Feminist mod
977,I've completely lost respect for that community. Especially the fact that people complain about getting banned from feminist forums.
978,"If they want to get females, but are rejected, they are not MGTOW's by definition. 
If they don't want females, and females don't want them, that could be MGTOW. It all depends on your mentality, it has nothing to do with being desirable by females"
979,"Women dont just collectively become the evil feminazis that you came to think they all are when they get older. There are some good women, some bad women; but just like human beings, there are good human beings, and bad human beings. We must learn to treat everyone with kindness and not treat anyone differently because of how society categorizes them :)"
980,"Ah I see, I did not know that. Good to know."
981,"r/mgtow got quarantined thats why it show 0 members and 0 online. No idea why it got quarantined probably another attempt to silence mgtow. i didnt even got a banned email just the notification that im permanently banned. but serious yesterday the mods of r/mgtow deleted a post about stuff you hate as a teenager but love as an adult, these thing where 1. a nap 2. a fuel efficient car 3. a middle class house and i dont remember the last. that wasnt the only harmless stuff they delete there"
982,"Heh, thanks for looking out bro. But they permanently banned me.

I immediately (max within 2 hours) asked them to provide a reason why and no mod responded. Very touchy about the circumcision issue, and I didn't even make a pro-circumcision post, I just had different view and challenged some claims made without evidence. Not much I can do about it, I'm taking it as an opportunity to take part in other MGTOW communities, maybe it's a sign I need to get off reddit completely and branch out into blogging and youtube."
983,"It is because it is unusual, not necessarily unnatural. In my point it is a physical affliction caused by context, usually in young age. I've met no person with sexual deviations of this sort that hasn't been abused in a way or another as a child. You can do whatever you like, but keep in mind you're a product of your environment, whatever coping mechanisms you might have, they're not for everyone."
984,"In the eyes of the ""traditionalists"", the queer and feminist evil world-domination agendas go hand-in-hand.  And there is fear that no straitgh man will be accepted in this new society."
985,Wow seems like all of you here are incels too lol
986,Yeah cause they're a cult.
987,"Thanks for your reply, it's highly appreciated."
988,"I'm not under 13, lmao."
989,OK Boomer
990,"I just want my daly dose of spicy memes with a dash of support among the people in there. And a little bit of inspiration, so sadly i have to move on from this sub. Mgtow 2 isnt the way."
991,Great thing about free speech is that you can choose what to read. Offended redditors could've kept scrolling but nope gotta throw out the baby with the bathwater.
992,"You nailed it. It's not MGTOW it's incels taking over MGTOW, incels are radicalized just as feminists and we paid the price, we got in the crossfire. Fuck this!"
993,"Don't be, it's gonna filter itself like that. MGTOW2 is breath of fresh air. I wouldn't even think about women if it wasn't for r/MGTOW"
994,"Not all Trump supporters are retards suffering from cognitive dissonance, but some of them are REALLY fucking crazy."
995,"He was born into wealth and got ""a small loan of a million dollars"", obviously this meant he had one foot in the door because he had more money, more connections and better knowledge on how to get rich, and he went down the same path as his father in real estate.

Despite this advantage he had 6 corporate bankruptcies, only surviving by using the shady chapter 11 bankruptcy."
996,"I think the prime issue for any cause of ""shit talking"" is there just seems to be a pretty heavy-handed approach when it comes to the use of the perma-ban button as a first line tool. 

I'm not a mod there so I dont know the policies or whatnot, but it's not the moderating path I goto. A lot of subs do it, but that's up to the moderating teams.

I do think that talking shit about women certainly has its place. Consider golf courses or cigar clubs or poker tables. Men need a spot to complain amongst themselves about shit that frustrates them, and for a lot of men, that is women. 

I agree there should be subs that allow for that. There does need to be moderation though because the incel rhetoric can easily grow out of that, and that should be kept in check. A lot of that shit is pretty unhealthy."
997,Facts
998,Same here.  The mindset over there is just pure blind rage and hatred toward women now.  I think it’s been taken over by the incels
999,"I'm left of center myself. It sounds like they are a bunch of tradcon Trump lovers, which just validates the bigotry that is on display."

1002,"“Unless somebody asks for my own opinion”
Sorry, I should have said that. No I’m not going to go out of my way to insult them but if they ask me if they’re, for instance, fat, I shouldn’t be shamed for saying yes."
1003,"Oh I see.

That last part kind of reminds me of the guy from the Green Mile. From what I remember, his heart was too big in the chest cavity, then he switched to a vegan diet and it couldn't pump the blood anymore and he died."
1004,"Well, what those dumbass mods are doing -not that they care- is sending a lot of bitter, angry guys over here.  I count myself among that number.  The MGTOW1 guys are men who've really been hard done by and are still ""back there"" on the road to health & recovery.  

Angry.  Frustrated.  Needing closure on what she did.  Trying to get past it.  Trying to heal.  Trying to keep to the high road, without sending her that final email I've been fucking holding myself back from sending...

That's where *I'm* at.  But don't want to pollute this place with my bad attitude.  But soon you'll need a MGTOW3 to get away from the former MGTOW1 guys who've all come over here."
1005,Great post. I agree. MGTOW is important. It does nobody any good if it's co-opted by a bunch of bigots.
1006,Good post. Agreed.
1007,Don't worry about it it happened to me also but what's even worse my YouTube channel got taken down so I had to make a new one
1008,Bruh xD
1009,"You're pretty much right.

1015,"That's a good idea. 

I dont know how to do that in a moderator role. I can sort a post by new but when I click back to it it is back on ""best"".

1021,"I have a lot of negative karma comments in there but the one that got me banned was me telling them that living on an island with all guys is rediculous. Most of the time when I get banned from a community, I talk to a mod and straighten it out unless I’m obviously trolling then fuck em, but mgtow was borderline toxic because of the skewed misunderstanding of what mgtow means, and it turns into a hatred of something rather than a prioritizing of your life."
1022,I actually agree with you that most of them are like that. Not a single dude would upvote my posts when I point out obvious flaws. Who the fuck wants to go live on an island with dudes only and call it glorious. Bitches are crazy but I don’t wanna live with all males forever.
1023,Nah
1024,Agree.
1025,Good luck

I know that r/inceltears has moved on to making fun of r/MGTOW for their daily fix/dosage as those other 2 subs got banned even though r/MGTOW is VERY different than r/incel and r/baincel."

1031,I wish I was better at math. Im sure there is some clever response to this.
1032,"Oh for sure. I think it would be ridiculous is a morbidly obese person asked you if you thought they were fat. It’s not like “fat” is a social construct. There’s people who think they’re fat when they’re really not, and there’s people who are actually “fat” but they don’t like to have that pointed out. Obesity is a thing that exists and if you’re obese, you’re obese."

I agree, as long as the supposed perpetrator is proven to be guilty. False pedo accusations are a frequently used tactic of vengeful women to get rid of a guy they want gone.

>We need a community that doesn't ban men for trying to gather and help each other, and every other social media platform is happy to censor or ban any and all men's content if it isn't tits, ass, and/or beer.

Reddit admins are far above mods. If they don't like your sub, they'll find an excuse to quarantine/ban it. See the Trump-friendly sub for example.  They can even go into the database and directly edit comments without any trace. If you want to create a free speech community, reddit is not your best bet, and I have no idea what is. Sites like discord demand your phone number for """"verification"""", and if you happen to live in a country where burner phones are banned _(muh terrorism)_ then it's pretty much self-doxxing."

Have you seen Peter Jackson's documentary? it's impressive."
1057,"wHiTE MAle rAgE


btw ladies, you can go ahead and thank our great great great grandfathers for that rage."
1058,It was great. I was impressed with the acting and the storyline was interesting. So excited for all these awesome war movies the past couple of years (like midway and Dunkirk also). Keep them coming!
1059,I'm taking my grandfather to see it today.
1060,I’ll go check it out.
1061,I dig the old-school wool outfits.  And the puttees are great.
1062,It was interesting seeing men's reaction..when talk of WW3 and draft's were discussed. Men love war movies and video games but when the idea came up that they might have to go to war. There were so many coward's.
1063,Sounds like it’s worth a watch!
1064,Yet to watch it. But all I've heard are fantastic reviews.
1065,Saw it a couple weeks ago. It’s become one of my favourite movies and I’d watch it again in a heartbeat
1066,Best movie I have seen in a long time.
1067,I just saw it today too and shared your thoughts.  As a movie I give it a solid 8/10.
1068,"Am I the only one who saw this movie as WOKE? These men were soy boys. They would have never survived the war. Get the German some water, he is thirsty, SHHHH, no don't shoot. OH, I have milk for your baby. Are you kidding me?  Plus what was with all the storm trooper German shooters. Holy crap. The sniper must have been like a hundred feet away with a clear shot, multiple shots. This movie was a joke. You remember the translator from Saving Private Ryan (good movie), that guy is what these two characters were. No toxic masculinity here. Just feminine qualities .

There is more I didn't like, but I ranted enough."
1069,"Lol, I never knew you could post pictures in this sub.

I thought pictures were forbidden to prevent this sub from becoming like r/MGTOW where it's flooded with low-quality memes."
1070,"The should make real movies based on real mens account. My Great Grandfather was at the Somme made it across to the other side, drank wine they found in a farmhouse, retreated back as no support and German counter attack imminent, lost a stripe and got number 1 field punishment. Was at Gallipoli and at the end ended up in Ireland when the uprising started. Was an engineer at the front from the start to the end of the war. Told my father many tales... piles of body parts. How the Anazacs wouldn't salute the British officers, how he got lucky when a shell obliterated all the men near him. The screams from no mans land during the night. How he was angry that in the 1930s depression ex soliders were literally left to die on the streets, how poppy day proceeds were given in greater amounts to widows of officers than ordinary soldiers."
1071,"Great movie! Along the Lines of Apocalypse Now but here the continual shot was amazing, submerging us right into the film.  It was great!!!!"
1072,"An inspiration of grit, bravery, charity, and never giving up. A perfect movie for MGTOWs."
1073,"I thought it was cool when the woman came forward to save the....oh, yeah that didn’t happen."
1074,"The sequence near the end where he runs through the trench, then over the top, to deliver the word was absolutely outstanding!"
1075,"I prefer WW2 movie, but I'll check it out."
1076,"It was ok.   Not the best war flick I've seen but pretty good sets and cinemaphotography.   Simple plot.    The detail was good, the trenches, the tank, the fighter aircraft.    The detail on the Albatross fighter was excellent but the scene with the german pilot was over the top bullshit.   No way a German pilot in WW1 would have done that.    Much more likely the other way around, after all the allied troops were getting strafed by these german pilots so they had quite a bit of anger built up."
1077,blatant propaga
1078,SJWs hated it so it must be good.
1079,"Thanks for the reminder want to see this it came out awhile back but was in limited production.

My overall thoughts on the most of these wars are they are ridiculous.Men fighting to the death and for what.Because some mentally ill dictator rises to power on the shoulders of weaker men.The loss of life and potential if man would stop killing man humanity would have no bounds."
1080,"Good filming, weak story."
1081,DiD yOu JuSt ASsuMe TheIr GeNderS??????????
1082,I think you wouldn’t be saying that if 40 million women died in that war instead of 40 million men.
1083,Well I for one think it's simply awful - the degree to which women were woefuilly under-represented amongst those killed and maimed in WW1 is simply sexism of the worst possible kind.
1084,Training men to embrace disposability. 🥱
1085,"This movie was so garbage. Saving Private Ryan, but for the non violent types. There's very little combat, just one dude, running around to deliver the a message.

It's like a bible story. The cinematography, fucking great. As a movie, boring as shit.

Be prepared for loud sharp gunshots though, they are few but still."
1086,I thought you were quarantined. Lol incels
1087,That men made a law that women can’t fight in wars plus men also started these wars for other men to fight in but it’s nice that they made a movie about it.
1088,planning on going this week and can’t wait. great films are such amazing pieces of art.
1089,"Saw it. Paints a very cheery picture of the war, ironically - as the lads were all mugging for the camera. Listen to Dan Carlins multi-part podcast about it."
1090,"Haven’t seen it yet...the film had no editing, just one long take...you felt like you were right there with the main character."
1091,The words 'thank you' aren't in their vocabulary.
1092,No I don’t have to those men have nothing to do with me I’m from Africa and if anything British men killed a lot of our people
1093,"I suppose that this is the subreddit where we get to pretend that this rage was purely constructive, huh."
1094,"Yes, really fantastic war movies, 1917 cinematography was top class, those long shots in one scene really adds to the suspense."
1095,"""Ah, shit, here we go again"""
1096,That's what propaganda will do to a captive audience.
1097,"I think it was a pretty darn good conversation starter and high-quality. 

We allow photo links we just don't allow video links without a breif description of them in the title. The videos should be relevant to mgtow."

It WW1 dude. Most of the time soldiers were in their trenches cold, eating bad food, getting the runs and  hoping not to get blown up by artillery. The front lines didn’t move for years. Check out Biggles if you want a complete action packed WW1 fantasy movie."
1102,"> sharp gunshot

It took a while scrolling down the list to find someone who agreed with me.  Those Germans were worse shots than the storm troopers. And they were always alone. Why were all the Germans so spread out and alone. Did the Movie need it to be like this so he would have a chance to get through his quest?"

Their mother is in health care, I actually need to call DSHS and ask them if I have to continue paying child support while they stay with me.... I'm sure the bloodsucking system will continue to charge me though.

However I am blessed to be an essential tradesmen so I do have work at the moment but... Nothing is concrete, work only comes in when people or contractors call.  I also follow strict safety procedures to ensure I don't bring anything home like wearing a high grade mask and eye protection as well as stripping and disenfecting when I come home.

But...again being single is much simpler... I had to have a long argument with their mother about the best way to keep all of us working, happy and healthy. The woman really knows how to be an irrational pain in the ass. 😆 🙄"

I tell her I will take a plane, she tells me not to because of this current situation.  There is no reason to say ""sorry"". I feel awful too.  Your post is not a rant.

We all go through this, and it is not easy.  Lots of us have mothers, sisters , dads who were caring. Sorry for your loss."
1211,"So it's like a hole left in her departure?  You're no longer loved unconditionally by anyone?  

Most people have social-emotional needs. They're increasingly hard to meet in our culture that is ever increasing in individualism. I mean to say, you are not alone in your suffering."
1212,You’re not alone trust me. My mother tragically passed away four years ago and I miss her very much. Nothing in this world comes close to the love of a mother. God bless
1213,I've lost my mom 2017. Keep thinking of her every now and then and her past actions which slowly bring me to light what she did in keeping the family safe. So Yea I'm doing these things as well in remembrance of her. Plus I dreamt of her as well. So yea can't wait for the day for me to meet her again.
1214,I lost my mother last year. I understand your pain.
1215,"I'm right there with you.

Lost my dad in 2008, lost my mom in 2018, I feel worse for my mom because she suffered alot and I feel like I failed to be there for her to hold her hand.

I was there the night before, tried to give her some water, she didn't recognize me and almost choked on the water. She had dementia. I stayed 10 minutes, gave her a kiss on the cheek and went downstairs.

When I went outside there was a parking ticket on my car, I still have it.

They called me that morning to say she passed away.

I feel like...the death of my dad prepared me for the death of my mom, like...it put hair on my chest, I was no longer the child being taken care of, now it was my turn to take care of them, I was the adult.

The full weight of that made me understand what it means to be a man, it means alot of loneliness, and heartache, adults don't get love, adults GIVE love. Being a man is a lonely business."
1216,I am sorry for you loss. Remember her love.
1217,"Rant? That's not a rant your just being honest with yourself and to others.

I'm truly sorry for your loss my dude, keep your chin up and just know she is watching over you. Trust me on that one"
1218,"My brother. I want you to know that she is still with you. Please, trust me on this. Go sit in a dark, quiet room and light a candle. Sit down and meditate while looking intently at the candle. Watch the way it moves back and forth on its own, even without wind. After a time, you will realize you are not on your own in that room. Go deeper. After an hour, you are just beginning. Go another hour and you will feel her presence. She is now with you, and she will be with you until you pass on to be rejoined with her. This is simply an exercise to help you feel that she is already there, but you will come to this understanding yourself eventually regardless."
1219,[removed]
1220,"Sorry for your losses, I know the pain, just try to bounce out of it when it grips you. Unfortunately endearment doesn't take hold until they pass, and that creates allot of pain.  

Stay well bro, try to keep your focus on tomorrow, it's not good to dwell in the past, there's no way to revive it or amend it, it's etched in stone. Life's a one way express ticket, there's no going back to visit, live strong and bold every day push life to it's limits, don't hesitate or be distracted by past events 

We only get one day at a time, it's best enjoyed if we're living in it!"
1221,"Wow. Haven't been on Reddit in a while and now it's hard hitting to have this as one of the first things to see. Let me reach out to ya man to man dude. I lost my mom about a decade ago, middle school. Gained a step mom since. It completely devoured everything from before and nobody in my family was in any way the same since. I still struggle to this day to understand what kind of person my mom was and who my dad was vs how he is now. My step mom is very different from my mom. I also now have sisters and half sisters. I am the sole brother, but not eldest. I mention this because it all gave me some of the most painful experiences that have made me more eye opened than average, and I want it to help you and other men too. Unlike many men, women haven't been an experience to me through media, gfs, etc. It was and still is direct and open. Losing a parent is tough. Losing a wife is tough. Losing a daughter is tough. It shakes people usually, it makes strong people vulnerable, but it can just as easily make vulnerable people strong. One thing it has opened my eyes to, is that whatever good a mother teaches needs to be strongly considered. Some lessons need to be combed through, analyzed and filtered. Some were spoken, others are shown. Do you know what one of the BIGGEST eye opener was and the one thing I absolutely swore, no matter what, to honor? Her last note before she passed:

Do not ever get a girl pregnant before you are ready.

Let that sink in, as that note itself negotiates between life and death. To me, it was a clear warning, whether it was meant to be or not. And I decided that I now have one blood parent left, a man. My father. And despite his own flaws, I realize that now he's become even more vital as he is the only other male in my family as both of my grandfathers have also passed and my uncles are distant from him in ways I am not. He went through his own deep psychological trauma, and I realize now he struggled as I did, a man expected to ""be a man"" while other family members benefited through other men's support and/or empathy he rarely got. Now, despite differences, I do feel closer to him than other family even maybe more than his second wife or his own mom. We bond as father son, as it should be and as men supporting men, as it also should be. Take this as you may."
1222,sorry for your loss brother.   and ya that is probs the realest statement.
1223,"Don’t ever apologize for a statement like that. I am fortunate enough to have a great family. My dad passed when he was 70 back in 2012 of prostate cancer (after a 12 year battle). And my oldest brother just passed of a heart attack this past September at age 54.

Life is precious, man. My mom and my middle brother are still alive. He is 51, my mom is 78. I don’t know how much time she has left, but I certainly believe it’s not a lot. 

My mom has been the one woman in my life that I can completely trust and she never steers me wrong. My dad was the same way. 

Consider yourself lucky to have a mom like that, but also she was lucky to have you in her life as well, it sounds like to me from the way you speak of her. 

The best thing you can do is go on and live your life in her honor, especially since she is the one who gave it to you. I have lost a lot of people in my life that I loved, and that is the best tribute you can give. 

Good luck, man. We’re all here for ya."
1224,"Hey man, really sorry for your loss. My mom (44) passed away in 2009. Dealing with it is still very hard but it does get ‘easier’. If you need any help or just someone to talk to, just send me a message."
1225,Sorry to hear. Wishing you the best.
1226,"This doesnt seem to be talked about much here, but the first step for a man becoming MGTOW in life is when he becomes financially and emotionally independent of his mother (and father, but more so mother). 

The stereotype of lazy millennials is partly due to mothers not letting their kids grow up. They keep them at home, pay their bills, pack their lunch, emotionally coddle them etc. Even when the kid is in their 20s, or worse 30s. 

MGTOW isn't just about being independent of relationships, it's about being independent of all women, and even all people. I'm sorry for your loss, and I'm probably being a bit insensitive here, but maybe I can present a productive and healthy point of view to look at this from."
1227,"You're lucky in a way. My mother didn't do that. She was mean and gaslighting me constantly. I sked my Dad while he was alive why mom komhated me and his reply was, ""because you remind her of me"". Mom is still alive, but stopped talking to me when I questioned her about some bad behavior on her part when I was 5. My question was basically just asking her why she called me a bastard all the time when u was 5."
1228,"I can't judge from your shoes, if she was a good person, I'm sorry, but telling you that modern mothers are people,who don't care about anyhting but themselves, might comfort you If you had a good person who actually loved you.

1233,"> MGTOW isn't just about being independent of relationships, it's about being independent of all women, and even all people.

No, it really isn't. **MGTOW is the RATIONAL decision to avoid legal entanglements with women based on a cost/benefit analysis of marriage/co-habitation. You build your world your way.**

What you are talking about is something different. You can be MGTOW and be independent of people, certainly. But going your own way is about your own choices. If that includes dependence on people, then that can also be a choice consistent with MGTOW, at least in my humble opinion.

My fear is that we start locking ideas into what MGTOW is that really has nothing to do with MGTOW. All people -- men and women -- should have healthy relationships with family, as long as their own needs aren't compromised. I agree that ideally we should be independent of our parents, but it isn't a MGTOW thing, it is a maturity thing. I'm happy to discuss if you disagree.

As a MGTOW, you can love your mother, you can even be dependent on her; just don't marry her."

I'm 60 years old, I love my mother and I will be devastated when she passes. There is an inter-dependence there, since I provide physical care and she provides some emotional support. Am I going my own way, in your opinion?

I'm not really arguing with you, in that I have my own definition of MGTOW which I am happy to stick to, and no doubt you are the same. I'm just interested in understanding where you are coming from."

1242,This is why I don't give a crap about reddit. Women write bad things about men all day long on reddit and their groups don't get banned.

In other words; if a crazy woman/white knight visits FDS religiously and attempt to go on a men killing spree, FDS will get Quarantine. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not invoking anyone to do this, I’m just saying Reddit Mods are lazy as fuck to do any research first.

1244,They should quarantine FDS then
1245,"Lmao.   I think its hilarious.  Women getting scared of MGTOW philosophy and its showing women’s true nature.  Can’t have male only spaces so they gotta ban everything.  I’m never returning to the plantation.   We all saw how quickly the subs gaining new subscribers before the desperate shutdown.  No way to stop MGTOW. 

2020 going to be hella fun.  75% of China is shut down due to coronavirus.  2nd largest economy in the world.  Its lot worse than they letting on.  Bet that virus was leaked out of Wuhan level 4 Biolab thats literally 10 miles from that seafood market.  China’s Chernobyl.  Couple of countries were already in a recession especially China.   US is not far behind with their QE repo market.  All that Central Bank money printing can’t go on forever.  

Feminists sjw failure, pending very bad recession and a very contagious coronavirus.....  lol.  This clown world is about to get worse while I just sit back in my chair eating popcorn.   Strong and independent?  Don’t need a man?   Ok...  I’m stepping out.  Lets see how women do without men.   lol"
1246,"Yet FDS, a sub where they ban you for « excessive male sympathizing », still exists..."
1247,"I think reddit needs to come out with a “public warning” on subreddits that let’s the subreddits users know that it is violating its policy, give it a few strikes before a quarantine takes place. That way maybe more corrective action can take place. Quarantines should be temporary depending on the circumstances as well. 

I understand that many MGTOW people have far right views.. but there are legitimate issues that men face today (as there are with women) that have discouraged them into relationships and so fourth. 

Personally, I see courts bias  (child custody/divorce), state laws bias, a need for mandatory paternity test at a child’s birth and cultural expectations that reduce men’s equalities in some areas. These I believe, are legitimate and noteworthy concerns.. I don’t understand why instead of a actual debate of these issues, that I ought to be labeled an “incel” or some other derogatory name.

Hopefully freedom of thoughts, expression and speech prevail on reddit. And if not, perhaps a non-profit version of reddit can be developed that is self funded through its users that donate to keep it running. (Like Wikipedia)"

1252,"Fuck, I was wondering why it wasn't showing up on my feed for a while. Figured it out today. What a shame.








The feminist cunts get their way, yet again. Reddit is a cesspool of cucks & simp libs. I've literally seen hundreds of posts dehumanizing, vilifying, abusing, ostracizing men all over the place and they get thousands of upvotes. But, god forbid if you ever criticize women. Lol pathetic.

Their lack of action to outright calls to violence from the Socialists and Communists on reddit and failure to equally enforce the rules/TOS are a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the requirements of 47 U.S.C. § 230. 

Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco and thus must abide by US laws. It isn't in their Terms of Service or rules that they are acting as a Chinese State Actor, thus they are conducting fraud against US Citizens. 

This censorship of US citizens is a violation of their First Amendment rights and private company or not, they operate a social media company on US soil. In the 2017 US Supreme Court case, 2017 Packingham vs NC, the Court stated that social media companies and cyberspace are the modern public square for discussing and disseminating ideas and this First Amendment protections apply.

Reddit acting as a state actor of China and censoring, banning, shadowbanning, or deleting US Citizens posts or quarantining communities is National Origin Discrimination pursuant to 42 USC § 2000a. US citizens and Patriot's have a right to free enterprise even on social media and it is a violation of US Federal Law to discriminate based on their National Origin, even Patriotic Americans whose pride and beliefs including gender roles and outright opposition to systematic Misandry prevalent in modern western society you may not share. 

Please copy and share this everywhere. Feel free to improve upon it which better research as I am not a lawyer. Mods should really add it or a version of it to the bot post at the top of every thread.

1315,"The feminist subreddits I’ve been in have been pretty toxic. Like you get banned for almost anything, if the mods think your not agreeing with the post. And when you dispute the ban your villainized immediately."
1316,[deleted]
1317,I don't know but I am raising a toast to its obnoxious moderator being banned.
1318,"True, but the real reason it's quarantined is because many young men come across it while browsing reddit. There's a fear that if more men continue to leave the plantation, feminism is dead in the water. What an embarrassment that would turn out to be."
1319,"Plus, they used a straw man as an excuse.  They claimed some MGTOW member was planning terr0r attacks and that law enforcement tracked his web searches of dangerous topics.  They didn't quote a single post this person made on MGTOW.  So someone can click on the ""join"" button and then search for nefarious things in a search engine, and get a sub banned.  Notice they never explain exactly how a MGTOW moderator is supposed to police what a member searches with a search engine or why that's supposedly a reasonable expectation."
1320,Reich wing shit like this is part of what doomed MGTOW1
1321,That’s so binary.
1322,Issue is this mate Reddit is a private web site that pays for it's own server space. They can ban and censor what they want. I myself am an ardent MGTOW and reject a lot of hate society places on us  men especially in family court. If you all want your own spaces go to separate websites and servers managed by MGTOW supporting reddit is useless.
1323,"I remember reddit being vehemetly opposed to PIPA/SOPA legislation in whichcensorship was the main concern, and now THEY'RE censoring stuff they don't like. Bunch of hypocrite wankers."
1324,Goes both ways man. I remember at the beginning the sub was full of posts focused on empowering men without being toxic when discussing about women. It became real nasty the past 2 years.
1325,"I mean, MGTOW certainly crossed the line into hate speech and call to violence."
1326,stfu incel
1327,"...no. I won't speak to the China thing because I haven't done that research, but there is no precedent for that being discrimination based on National Origin. It's just regular violation of Free Speech which frankly is worse anyway.

No point trying to drum this up as something worse than it is, especially when that weakens your position."
1328,Based. I’d unironically rather have the Chinese own all my data than the United States government.
1329,"""Yeah guys! We're gonna sue those meanies at reddit for not letting us inceljerk on the front page!"""
1330,[removed]
1331,Probably because their horrific behaviour doesn't change.
1332,There is this:  [https://www.goingyourownway.com/](https://www.goingyourownway.com/)
1333,"It's called MGTOW2. The original mgtow was packed with incels. Which by itself isnt necessarily a bad thing as I can understand where incels are coming from - dealing with similar problems when I was younger. But it becomes an echo chamber which can produce some pretty malignant attitudes. 

MGTOW (at least to me) isnt about hating women. It's about being indifferent to them."
1334,How come it doesn't count? I rarely visit that site so I've no idea what's going on behind the scene.
1335,"Nope. It’s gonna stay quarantined and a dead mass of toxicity. Used to be a kickass subreddit about dudes being dudes, going their own way. Now it’s a clusterfuck cancer shitshow of overflow users from r/incels and a bunch of them got modded and now circlejerk each other over banning people for wrongthink."
1336,Spoken like a true feminist. You do know the so called feminist sisterhood preaches the same damn thing. Mgtow is individualism not group cult bullshit.
1337,"Yeah, I had seen the same thing. It is just quarantined.  Here is the behavior I saw:

1.  The sub disappeared from my list of subscribed subs.
2.  The sub's content disappeared from my front page.

I then navigated to reddit.com/r/MGTOW directly, and got the quarantine warning.  Once I acknowledged it I was brought to the sub.

At that point the MGTOW sub STILL doesn't appear in my list of subscribed subs, but now the articles do show up in my front page feed alongside other subs.

Bottom line is that with quarantine they are trying to get people who aren't actively visiting the sub to forget that it exists, and taking subtle measures to try to decrease the popularity of the sub, without outright banning it.  I suspect they have statistical data that the measures they're taking lower traffic over the long term, otherwise they wouldn't be stopping at what they're doing.  

I believe it also makes it less likely to show up in search results.  The goal is probably so that when guys type in the search bar ""does anybody else think marriage isn't worth it?"" or something similarly general they don't get pointed at MGTOW subs.  If they haven't heard of MGTOW already the goal is that they don't hear about it.

I'm skeptical that this sort of thing will do much in the case of MGTOW.  The trends that are driving men to go their own way are so large that it is going to be almost impossible to stop this without making big changes in how society works.  Half the trends on twitter/etc are practically advertisements for MGTOW..."
1338,"i think the reddit creators might be a bit far left/liberal and dont want to see any forums that is sort of against women, altough i am not sure if that really is the case but we see this more and more often with big companies. remember the gillette ad with the toxic masculinety hahaha."
1339,"Why do you think? It’s obvious. They don’t want this idea spreading. Men, especially white men, are probably the most attacked people right now. It’s like a fucking white genocide right now. Obvious. Anything that gives men power back is being crushed."
1340,Yeah I can’t open it either. This is clearly forced.
1341,It's definitely inoperable. 'Guess the gyncocracy has finally taken Reddit.
1342,"I once saw a commenter on that sub literally supporting fascism, saying it was a desirable system but claimed that this was bc it was about supporting the family unit."
1343,When did they advocate pedophilia?
1344,Challenge Accepted.
1345,[deleted]
1346,I think most of us are.  That place quite literally embodies every negative MGTOW stereotype and then pretend they don't.
1347,Me too ._.
1348,Lol I knew the sub was compromised the second I got banned
1349,"me. I get banned anytime I make a new account in a matter of days. It's been six so far. I don't even go out of my way to call out the people who talk about taking womens rights or pedophillia or rape. They just seem to ban you if you get reported, even if nothing goes wrong."
1350,Dangzanut banned u
1351,"Click op’s link and you’ll see it in your feed from then on out.  
Quarantines are “suspicions” places on subreddits. Basically anything big brother reddit doesn’t agree with."
1352,"Take a guess: I got banned from r/rant for saying that my school had lgbt propaganda, why wouldn’t r/MGTOW be banned for “sexism”,  “transphobia” or “misogyny”. Hell, at some point r/MGTOW became a male feminist subreddit."
1353,Dude i somehow got made where i cant comment or post anything on there even tho i dont think i said anything that they wouldnt agree with.
1354,i liked it when feminists were shocked
1355,"That sub needs to die, it's lost it's way."
1356,reeeee
1357,"The reddit site admins can see that this sub was created LONG before mgtow was quarantined. 

It's not a quarantine evasion attempt in the least. 

The subs are similar in name, but the rules are *COMPLETELY* different."
1358,It's incredibly common for subs to limit discussions about current events to only one stickied post to prevent floods of low effort posts that are the same thing. They're literally providing you with a platform to discuss the event why are you even mad.
1359,"Because the sheer volume of people talking about a certain issue in a new post every 2 minutes would quickly overwhelm the sub. 

Placing a mega-thread provides a place for people to discuss the issue or event without constantly rehashing the same point over and over, and leaves space in the sub for the content the sub is setup for."
1360,"This sub was made in the first place because people wanted a place to discuss MGTOW, without being drown in posts bitching about women, which is 90% of content on /r/MGTOW. If you remove that rule, there's no point existence of this sub. You can just go to original sub instead."
1361,"* The creator(s) of this subreddit started it for purposes conscientiously divergent from the original subreddit; not for *your* purposes or *my* purposes.  This is not our subreddit; it's theirs.
* If you don't like the posting rules, don't post.
* If you don't like the content restrictions, go someplace that doesn't have them."
1362,Exactly it should be about empowerement mainly
1363,"this was my main issue with that sub. i had to unsubscribe because after a while it was extremely obvious that a majority of the people on there didn’t really care about self growth on their own as a single man, but instead hated women for virtually no other reason than because they were women. 

i was so sick of people just being blatantly sexist on their with their old, shitty, boomer facebook memes and everyone in the sub just eating it up. honestly glad it got quarantined"
1364,"There was always a bit of that in the sub, but it got a LOT worse once the Incel sub was banned.  Also didn’t help that TFM and other content creators embraced the “WAHMEN ARE ALL STUPID WHORES” incel faction."
1365,Can you be more specific ?
1366,"And yet, the women over at r/pinkpillfeminism are constantly bashing men 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, yet that's OK or the exception because vagina, right?"
1367,"I'm not saying that either is right. But women need to stop being treated like babies. They're grown ups whether they act like one or not. It's unfair on the men who lost their MGTOW sub, when the women over there are given free reign to rag on men unchecked. Double standards aren't cool. Unfortunately, I doubt something will ever happen about that sub because they're women and society won't see under their facade. They can do no evil, right?"
1368,"I disagree. This sub is geared to help you move forward. 

This is a place to put your money where your mouth is. 

You a mgtow? Ok. Put up or shut up. Post it. What are you doing with your freedom from women and the societal laws that aim to tap your resources and use you as a battery?

You making money? Getting healthy and staying fit? Out for a 3 week hike in the mountains with your dog? Travelling europe maybe? Or just enjoying a peaceful evening of quiet in a home you own (or even built?)?   

A lot of redpill subs provide a space for whinging about what made you angry. This sub is for you to show ""where are you going, now that you're going your own way?""

This sub is for looking forward, not backward."
1369,Exactly. People saying don’t tell other men about the women that made you go mgtow are just trying to kill mgtow.

Last time I checked, the flu didn’t quarantine whole cities and put 20% of infected into ICU.   Flu is only 1%.   And China has not enough test kits to diagnosis everyone.   Maybe about 2k a day"
1385,I would agree with something like this if mods on reddit were paid.
1386,LMAO i love you
1387,What does incels mean?
1388,"Yeah guys, I miss the other MGTOW. Perfect example would be right above me^"
1389,that's exactly how they banned r/incels and quarantined Trump's sub: false flag.

Also, the Democrats have multiple open antisemites and your party hasn't and won't get rid of them. It's sounds like Democrats were and are the Reich."
1391,and left wing shit is what created   mgtow  and mra
1392,That suggestion is absolutely laughable. You have a large philosophical community you will inevitably have a large amount of different view. Aswell to suggest that was the reason it was taken down is even more laughable. The reason is to shut peoples minds to options and information to more easily control them. Aswell to  keep the welfare system going through theft of money via child support.

1401,"I agree. At first the sub was about warning men about the dangers of women’s manipulative ways, divorce stories and encouraging other men to be the best they could be. Somewhere it turned into a wall that incels hid behind as a reason to justify why they couldn’t get laid or were scared to talk to women."
1402,Have you ever tried posting anything there? I dare you to try...
1403,"People need groups and support. 

Unlike you I'm happy to admit that. 

Something tells me you're just pretending to be ok. 

Stop pretending. 

You've got friends here."
1404,Well it’s nothing new that a quarantine is just a ban but without being honest about it. Wouldn’t want to say you hate the content. But anybody with half a braincell.(so not the average ahs follower or anyone that thinks mgtow is a hate movement) will see that it’s just a complicated ban
1405,it also hides the number of subscribers and online members as well
1406,"They don't want to lose the user count from banning it, it's the same reason they quarantined The Donald, they would lose a lot of users, and that would ultimately hurt their bottom line."
1407,The term “MGTOW” is not as hot as it once was. The Zoomer meme version of MGTOW is “Simps” vs “Kings”

1410,White men being the most attacked right now? Seriously bro? What do you base that off of?
1411,There are literally communist subs on here. So supporting fascism is bad but not communism?
1412,It is overwhelming conservative and T_D centered recently so it would make sense there would be some overlap I guess
1413,"Never as far as I've seen.  What Im saying is I've now seen others *claim* that in multiple threads.

Its the exact same things they say about incels as well.
Its like they took the exact list and then posted it as fact."
1414,Literally never.
1415,Upvoted because you guys are actually taking care of things
1416,"Haven't seen that comment, nor do I really care. Just because one person comments something, doesn't mean the sub reflects that."
1417,Compromised. It is interesting reading the guy below talking about China. It never struck me before. I just thought it was run by a jerk. There is a user on there I won't post his reddit screen name but he is literally all over it. Anytime there is anything said on there he says women only want money. This is guy is clearly rich but it seems his money is driving him mad. It is almost pavlovian as well as boring and annoying. He seems to be in denial that women want anything else in the world other than money. I can think of a lot of things they want that aren't about money (but probably require it- but hey thats how we are all enslaved if money didn't exist we would be murdering each other ). If you go on there and you don't know who I am talking about you will. Except oh you are banned!
1418,What about the idiots glorfying Sharia law?
1419,lol me too
1420,Nice try.
1421,"I knew it, I never had any exchange with him (unless he had other accounts but even so , unlikely) but thought it was him that banned me. I have a good bullshit radar and he stank like bull shit. He may be rich but that all that money talk is hiding something he repulses humans thats his problem. Everyone had to pay because rich loser guy had his finger on the ban button lmao All his money and a bum on the street got more class ."

1425,Yea The whole thing doesn’t even show up for me at all.
1426,it happens. its just 'oh someone reported this? ban them'.
1427,Lost its way? Why because it pointed out the bs women do?
1428,"Hasn't stopped them in the past. They invited T_D to some contest to revive an unused sub, then banned it for quarantine evasion."
1429,I don't engage with people so autistic they can't detect basic emotion and so assume everyone is mad.
1430,I'm not talking about women.
1431,You're wrong. Subs are for the community not for the janitors who do everything they can to avoid doing anything.
1432,A lot of guys seemed to enjoy wallowing in this toxic incel stew to validate their own rage. They should have just opened a sub of their own and fucked off there.
1433,It’s reddit the fuck you expect
1434,"I made a post about this pretty much. I got told to bring it in here, but that’s exactly how I would see a true MGTOW page would look like instead of focusing on bashing and the negatives of women. It’s mentally draining for no reason. Way better off to post about your life, business, travels, etc. 

Best revenge against anyone is that to show you’re doing much better in life than you were before"
1435,"You can tell I hit the nail on the head with my analogy because a mod needed felt the need to respond with a “distinguished” novel that doesn’t address my analogy in the slightest. 

**People need therapy, which requires talking about past traumas. Just like denying ex Mormons the right to complain about “the so called church” as they call it, denying men the right to complain about their relationship traumas with women is doing them a **massive** disservice. **

This sub is not geared to help anyone because it’s actively censoring the elephant in the room, By refusing to be even acknowledge the reason why men go their own way more than half the discussion and healing that could be had is denied. 

Again, **this sub is pointless** bordering on actively harmful."
1436,Their not being banned for the same thing doesn't change what that sub is.
1437,No u
1438,Everybody doesn’t shame us though. There’s a reason it’s quarantined though. You just have to at watch out for people like them. I know I’m generalizing but the internet is a dark place

If you’re talking about n19Coronavirus, it is NOT a flu and it is not 33% mortality. It’s not even 33% serious.

About 2% based on *known* cases. There are certainly many cases so mild that they do not come to the attention of health care. The vast majority of those severely affected and dying are elderly, ill, or otherwise immunocompromised. Last I heard, no one under 15 had died (unlike influenza, which kills many children every year). 

Now, how about you provide your sources for the conspiracy claim that it’s a bioweapon (note that I don’t take YouTube or shock jocks as ‘sources,’ and I’d prefer valid medical sources), and that everyone is going to die and civilization will fall?

1451,"Sure.  I think the goal is to put enough suppression in place that the influence will slowly shrink, but not so much that it all scatters away and finds a new place to live.

Think about the torrent wars 20 years ago.  Imagine instead of shutting down napster/etc the RIAA managed to find a way to throttle it so that downloads worked, but were painfully slow.  If they found the right balance then a lot of people would have stuck with it due to the effort required to create something new, and then the painful experience would have helped reduce the number of people pirating content.  Instead they used a sledgehammer and shut everything down, and thus there was a huge void and somebody created a new technology to fill the void. Then because there was no competition, everybody rapidly adopted the new technology.  If there was instead competition between the legacy technology that had a painful experience but an extensive library of content, and a new technology that was better which nobody actually used yet, then that would have fragmented the community and slowed adoption.

I think that is the goal here.  Don't scatter the roaches.  Instead get them to huddle up while the oxygen is slowly removed from the compartment.  Plus you get less outrage because it isn't a complete ban."

Although DangZagnut does sound like a total asshole.

Although you are listening to a guy with a tiny sack and a big shaft, so consider the source.

Also I don’t moderate /r/MGTOW.  You’d have to write the ss_camaro mod there to know why."

And anyone who had been banned (temporarily or permanently) gets a clear reason as to why, what rule was broken.

And I'm responding to many more posts and comments with ""distinguished"" because I want to remove any doubt...... this sub is NOT a mgtow1 refugee camp.

If you want to sit on your ass and bitch and complain about some wahmen bad thing that happened to you, see a shrink. Take some pills, post on other reddit subs. Not this one. 

Your analogy is simply wrong for this sub, and that was the purpose of my explanation. 

This is for the men who are moving forward, not left behind. 

And that is the end of the discussion on it. Period.

As I've said before to posters in the past who want to some here and just try and hijack the sub to turn it onto the ""mgtow is about complaining about women"" train tracks, I'll give you 24 hours to read the sub description and rules, then post *literally anything* that follows those rules and relates to YOUR mgtow journey and how it is impacting your life in a positive way. Put up, or shut up. 

This is not mgtow1, or any other redpill sub."
1476,"I'd disagree. While the other sub was full of spite and hate, this one focuses on moving forward from trauma. If you wanna vent, vent there. This isn't the sub for that.q"
1477,"This shows your own naivete. Believe what you want buddy, Im sure the world is a place of kindness, sunshine, and rainbows. Just don't be surprised if you get bent over backwards by it"
1478,Fair for a few. Not for everyone. I've never had a sex addiction. And focusing exclusively on women like mgtow1 is counter productive if that's truly the case for you. Which is why that sub is garbage and quarantined
1479,"> what do you mean by ‘Run its course’?

I mean that if you get infected, you either defeat the virus or die from it, given enough time. Most of the lamestream media only tracks how many people get infected and how many die on a day, they don't track the infected ones whether they can fight it off or die from it on longer time periods.

It's like marriage and divorce stats. The state gives you how many marriages and divorces happened in X year, and the _crude divorce rate_ is simply calculated from these two numbers. They don't track individual marriages to find out if a spouse died or they got divorced after 45 years."

1518,"You're entitled to your opinion. But that makes me laugh. You're coming over from mgtow1 where you can be banned instantly with no reason given. Where the rules are written so hap-hazardly that any post you make could be construed as breaking one of them, which catches you a ban....  but yeah, the rules here are ""authoritarian censorship""... no. 

And you have the entire rest of the red pill sub reddits to post what you like. 

And yes, this is not a free-speech sub. It does have a narrower view. And the rules are not complex at all. ""Focus on yourself, not women, dont post low effort memes, dont be a nazi, be civil, dont trash talk other subs and put a synopsis on youtube links so we know it's not spam.""  .... that's as mgtow as it gets and if you're one of those ""mgtow means do whatever I want and have no purpose but shit posts and projecting my anger about women"" types, well then nobody is forcing you to be here, are they?

I've got an important year coming up and a lot to accomplish and a lot to learn as a single dad. Hoping to learn from others who have gone down that path.

Mgtow 1 was important for the people like you who are still in the ""red pill rage"" phase. Lot of us here are past that phase. Hence the need for 2 subs"
1522,No you did a perfect job at citing your sources it's just that the media normally dont release everything they know about a subject. Although citing the CDC or another agency tasked with those subjects is generally a better option for something like a disease.

1524,It’s just so far from reality that it’s shocking to see. You are brainwashed.
1525,"Ok, white people in general are responsible for far less crime (now anyway), but that doesn’t refute my two previous examples. Also, some of the opinions of these articles are questionable at best, such as fatal police shootings favoring blacks over whites. That’s clearly bullshit, I can’t even remember how many cases of unarmed black men being shot by the police I’ve heard, given how often they’ve happened. 

Before you start claiming white people are oppressed, look at the justice system. Black men getting sentences muuuuch longer and severe than white men ALL the time. You think if Brock Turner was black he’d be free? Lmao you probably do because you’re an idiot, but fyi, he would be locked up for many years to come."

1528,">And the rules are not complex at all. ""Focus on yourself, not women, dont post low effort memes, dont be a nazi, be civil, dont trash talk other subs and put a synopsis on youtube links so we know it's not spam."" 

Except that is far from the only rules as published in your side bar,  if those where they only rules I may not have a huge problem with them.  Personally the rules I find most objectionable and subjective is the ""effort and quality"" rule,  ""civility"" rule, and ""relevance"", all of which are WIDELY subjective

Then there is of course the rule about ""No denigrating other subs for the quality of their content."" which is routinely violated when it some to talking about MGTOW1  and other subreddits you dislike which is amusing given your complaints about how MGTOW1 is moderated, a complaint I disagree with having seen nor had any issues with the moderation there.

>If your idea of ""going your own way"" is complaining about women, then this probably isnt the sub for you. 

While my idea is MGTOW is not complaining about women,  I left my rage phase well over 20 years ago.  I have been MGTOW for longer than MGTOW has been a thing on the internet,  and longer than many on this subreddit have been alive.  

However this subreddit seem to be more about Physical ""success"",  believing that the ""true path to MGTOW"" is body building gym rat shit.  I have no interest in that.  I pursue wealth building, FIRE, intellectual interests,  not dieting and exercise which seems to be focus of this place,  so you are likely correct this is not the subreddit for me

Relevance: posts about politics or cat ladies are not relevant. Portraying mgtow in a positive light as it relates to independent male living is.

I mention the moderating habits of mgtow1 because it's relevant to this exchange as I'm expounding on the sub reddit rules for you. There are different moderating habits for that sub than there are here. For example, you havent been banned here for questioning the mods. Try that on other red pill subs and see how far that gets you. 

You may object to the content here. You may object to the rules and how they are enforced. Id refer you to the banned from mgtow mega thread to get a good idea from people who have had dealings with the moderation practices there.

1543,"Nice job with the name calling, you definitely proved you’re an asshole incapable of having an argument while remaining civil. 

What you said about repeat offenders is your assumption, which isn’t true. Look at how many years somebody gets for selling or using cocaine vs crack cocaine. There’s a different in sentencing. Why? Because white people are usually the ones using cocaine while blacks use crack. Totally not racist right? Again, Brock Turner got released from prison because he was a “good athlete”, bet you the judge would have never thought of that had he been black. 

Also, yes, black people tend to have more criminal history than other races, but also because of the racist history our country has of keeping them under poverty. Banks wouldn’t loan blacks money for the housing market until very recently, 80’s or 90’s, something like that. Anyway my point here is that while not justifying it, it’s logical to believe a large group under poverty will do anything to survive, including crime. Then, you add the fact that job applications discriminate people based off their criminal history, and you get the high % of recidivism that the articles talked about. Not many opportunities + poverty + not allowing people to integrate back to society = perpetual criminal records."
1544,"> For example, you havent been banned here for questioning the mods. Try that on other red pill subs and see how far that gets you. 

I have on MGTOW,  I was not banned. MGTOW and MenRights are the only to men subreddits I post to,  the others do not interest me.  

I challenge mods all the time in Subreddits,  sometimes I am banned most times I am not.  I have challenges mods in MensRights, MGTOW, KIA, KIA2, and several others

I do not fear bans,  reddit to me a time suck,  something to do when I am bored.  I express myself if people want to ban me for that well that is their problem not mind.  Being a closed minded fool generally results in a shitty life. 

>But I'm not changing any of this sub because you disapprove

I am not asking you to,  I was simply pointing out the hypocrisy and bullshit.  I never had any expectation that my words would result in any changes. 

Subreddits like this never really grow beyond  a few thousands members because of the massive limitations on what can be talked about.  That can be a good thing, close knit communities can be good.  Sucks for a movement,  sucks if you are trying to bring actual awareness to what MGTOW is and how it can save men, but...

I browse MGTOW and MenRights in the hope that I can help a man cope with what is happening to him in his life,  this is why I am not put off by the posts in MGTOW1,  I want to help those men move past that rage on to something better.  You want to reject them and isolate them.  Different paths, different goals

>If you dont like them you can move on if you prefer. Nobody forces you to participate here. 

I probably will,  There is not much discussions here that interest me. I like to talk politics,  I like to discuss how the Culture war effects men, how politics effect men,  etc.  This is what I want to discuss,  you ban those discussions so...

1548,Have a nice day? Smiley face for you 😀
1549,"Sorry, but you have your facts quite wrong:

    Turner didn't rape anyone. He was initially charges with 2 counts of rape, 2 counts of fingering (foreplay), and one count of intent (erection). He was not convicted of rape; the prosecutor had to drop the two counts of rape early on, due to complete lack of evidence. Turner was convicted of the two counts of drunken foreplay and one count of probable erection.

    The two counts of rape were dropped because he didn't take out his penis, much less put it in anyone.

    The two counts of sexual assault did indeed involve his fingers - in drunken foreplay, to which the girl had consented thrice. Her consent was never disproved, nor was it ever disproved that her passing out occurred after the fingering.

    In other words, she was never proved unconscious during the fingering. Thus your statement is again in error.

    The conviction of intent had as sole basis an officer's speculation that a ""cylindrical"" appearance under Turner's pants, was an erection. (Considering many young men get an erection just looking at a woman, were an erection proof of intent to rape, much of humanity would be in gaol.)

    The foregoing are all mitigating circumstances or outright grounds for acquittal. Terming them ""excuses"" is an ethical crime; every judge and jury are required to consider such mitigating or exculpatory facts.

    Additional ""excuses"" - strongly mitigating material - are the 39 letters legitimately addressed to the judge as part of the sentencing process, from both males and females who had known him his whole life, attesting to their belief that he had not a malicious bone in his body, and any offence given was in their belief purely unintentional, in alcoholic stupor."

They often stick to me and express great joy when I'm pulling into the driveway even when I'm not the main food provider for them. They know my car a full 2 minutes early I swear.  
It's mutual. Ive always loved them and they notice.  

One cat in particular was so fond of me he wouldn't even touch his food until I took him up for a minute at least.  
He was unique, and he was stupid (inbred). We were both very attached to each other. I have a great picture of him with me but it's not on my phone. I always said that he actually wanted to be born as a dog.

Personally, I define feminism as the political movement of the sub-par females to leverage their vote in order to get their hands on the resources which they ""deserve"" but are not able or unwilling to get the traditional way (i.e. scamming the males out of their money under the current gynocentric laws). And they're using their phony ""victimhood"" because it helps greatly with that. The ""equality"" which the feminists are constantly harping about is actually the ""equality of outcome"" along the lines of: ""that woman was able to secure a good husband &/or job and  I was not; therefore, it's obvious that the patriarchy is oppressing me and I deserve to be compensated by society for being persecuted."" That's how the feminists really think and that's the very reason why you never argue with them: it's next to impossible to make someone understand something when their income depends on NOT understanding it. IMHO, the equality of outcome (i.e. communism) is not equality at all and I'm talking from personal experience, actually. As Aristotle said 2.5K years ago, ""The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal."" The feminism is evil in its most basic form and must be fought with everything we'we got because if it wins, the men will become the abject slaves, no doubt about it...."

1604,"That was pretty brilliant, guy."
1605,"I have come to the exact same end conclusion that feminism, the way it trends, leads to re-introduction of slavery as it ultimately desires to have the power to arbitrarily call any sexual act a criminal offense whenever it wants - Only dictators are in the same position as the power they have is to command the hand of the law according to their will - In its completion this would reduce men to a slave class while women would be elevated to noble citizenry / master class, just like Ancient Greece and Rome had a slave class of sub-humans who were there to do all the work that could be exploited in any way on the whim of the master class citizens.  


This is the end game agenda, even if not conscious one, of feminism.  
In other words, even if well intended, this is the automatic final state if feminism does not meet enough resistance."
1606,"You are not alone my friend. Most people have not heard a great many truths about feminism...because they have become so adept at the lie, have so much power, they can not only censor the movie, but the very fact that they did censor it.  They censor the truth, then they hide the truth, then they hide the fact that they hid the truth.

&#x200B;

Most people that I speak with on line, that still believe that feminism is about equality and not a hate group aimed at men, are so naive of the truth, have so little understanding, that it would take ten posts to bring them up to speed.

The truth of the matter is that no less than 80% of all women (probably over 90%) would support such a system wholeheartedly..."

1612,You bet. Glad to help.
1613,">Maybe the femanuts try doing one of their ""studies"" on male Humor.

Not going to work because stupid people do not usually understand humor and hate the people who do (usually, the men). That's because the feminists are not only devoid of the sense of humor themselves, jealous of others who have it but are also very suspicious & fearful that people are joking at their expense (which is not entirely untrue...). As far as ""get a life"" goes, that's the core of the issue: they are feminists precisely because they can't get a life and NOT the other way around...."
1614,"I saw that post an agree with that. In addition, the females want the right to reinterpret consent post-factum and sometimes years or decades after the fact. Case in point: the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. Not only that, they want their claims to be judged to be ""true till proven false"" and not the other way around (i.e. #BelieveAllWomen). In short they want the end of the Due Process but only in one direction because ""reasons"". I have a simple solution to all that mindfuckery, at least on the personal level. Do not engage with any ""regular"" women in the West. Avoid them like the plague they are. To me, they are all the property of the state, their real daddy-husband and I do not mess with the government property.... P.S. You're ""better"" than me because I reported, blocked that person & forgot about it..."
1615,"and you are getting smarter every time I read you...

kidding of course, but dead on the money accurate."
1616,"Oh yeah, I didn't even remember post-factum which is horrible.

In the worst case not only you'd need to record all your sex acts with women, you'd have to store them forever - And when it comes to the current practices of divorce courts, evidence for the man is often completely ignored by the judge - So practically you'd never be safe even with consent.

I think you are completely right about ending Due Process, which is currently in the process of being eroded for women just because vagina.

And yes, avoid all BP women in the West and gauge actively for these belief systems in any women you engage with in order to stay safe."

1619,"> I changed my diet from eating £10-15 worth of take away junk food including drinking 3 litres of Coca Cola a day to one 3 piece chicken and chips (fries) meal with 3 hotwings and a can of coke. Yes this isn't exactly a healthy meal however it has much less calories in it than what I used to have. 

No, not a healthy meal but guess what?  It is a HELLUVA improvement from what you were eating.  That's how progress works.  Later, you'll replace your first can of coke with water.  But for now, pat yourself on the back for improving.

If you focus on the goal, you are indeed ""low value"".  However, if you focus on the PATH (which I am a believer of), you are actually high value because you are following the Way.  A man who looks to improve and acts upon it?  He is nothing short of nobility.  

Keep it up.  You have an army of men who are proud of you and are rooting for you to continue your successes as a high-value man.

You're fucking awesome man. You've accepted where you are, accepted how society works and accepted that YOU, not others, are the change that needs to happen.

I say GOOD FOR YOU MAN. I've been down in low value territory and I'm heading there again with my life choices. Higher value people who are consistent don't often appreciate how HARD it is to climb out of a rut. But, those of us who have done it DO KNOW.

If a good and truly high value woman comes along, with whom you're properly compatible with and you two can work synergistically as a good team, all the better. 

Also have you considered fasting? Amazing benefits if you can stand it, whether intermittently or prolonged.

1 year ago i began to grow a beard, hit the gym and eat properly, and i've realised that people respect me more and i really feel good about myself, i didn't even do it because of external acceptance, but rather self love and self improvement."
1635,Never stop improving. Ever.
1636,There is more to your value than your physical appearance and income. You can produce or at least appreciate art and music. You can examine and improve the way you think through philosophy.

Just watch your grains and limit them to a measured serving a day. Avoid the fuck out of sugar. You will withdraw but after a month broccoli will taste sweet to you.

1641,"If you are concerned with weight, you're in the perfect part of the internet to find help. There are quite a few subreddits here that'll surely be helpful. 

Before that, are you lazy? If it's a YES, then we have something in common. Are you cheap? If it's a YES, then we have something in common. Do you not like exercise at the moment? If it's a YES, Then we have something again in common.

 Are you determined? If there answer is YES then here are a few subbreddits to help you out r/intermittentfasting, r/fasting, r/OMAD. There have been countless videos and articles on the internet of people that have had great success with Intermittent Fasting (IF). I have. Take a look at the before and after progress pics in both r/fasting and r/intermittentfasting.

Visit those subbreddits, reply here or private message me, I'd be happy to help if anyway I can. There's numerous positive benefits of IF; loosing weight is almost like one of the minor benefits but it's the main reason most are attracted to it. I've been doing it almost a year now; it's a lifestyle.

Here's an animated video about Water fasting/ Fasting to get some points across: [https://youtu.be/DghrZNUP5vo](https://youtu.be/DghrZNUP5vo)

Trust me, it's worth the watch.

Adding exercise to the melting pot only  expedites the process. Exercise is tough to get into but I like to compare it to taking a shower. At first you don't wanna get into the water but when you do, it's difficult to leave it. It's in NO WAY NECESSARY to loose weight but it gets you to the goal quicker.

Change is difficult but admitting that you need to change is already a step in the right direction.

Side note: I am new to Reddit (was a lurker until recently) so I don't know if linking other subbreddits is fine or not so please let me know anyone.."

1644,"I would rather ask you to speak to yourself differently; I am a changing man. Value is really yours to determine. Don't internalise the opinions of others. Plants don't grow up to the light of the sun, to spite the darkness of their beginnings as seeds in soil. They are doing it to grow. And so you are growing towards the light of your potential. 

You have given yourself credit; so what would condemning yourself, really do?

Well done!"
1645,Yes! Be proud of your improvements. Keep going. Try looking into intermittent fasting if you haven't already.
1646,"You're off to a great start. Oftentimes, working on our physical/health shortcomings leads to greater things. In fact, a study showed that exercise had a more positive affect on young boys' confidence than receiving high marks in school. I'm sure that has an affect on adults as well. 

Don't stop there, though. Being an overall high value person TO YOURSELF means also exercising your brain. Read books that offer positive information on personality, psychology, confidence, and even finance so you can be well rounded. Not get books on how to manipulate people or get rich quick junk. Even if you read 3 books a year, that's a lot more information than you had the year before. 

Good luck, man, and congrats on the forward momentum. Stay on that shit!"
1647,"When using the term ""value"", you have to understand relative value.

When thots are brainwashed into thinking ""they're worth it"", ""I deserve better"", etc. without understanding the real ecosystem, anyone can be a ""low value man"".

But that's them, their label for anyone they don't choose. Are you really low value ? Or were you tricked into thinking you're low value ?

1649,"The thing about men is that low value isn't a judgment of you per se, but a judgment of your current set up. As you know, you can change that. Regardless, I hope you're working to change for reasons other than girls."
1650,"Low value man is a term women coined since they size up based on looks, money, etc.  The term low value man should not exist in your own vocabulary.  there are only two types of men you should think about.  There are weak men and strong men. If you are weak, know that you can become strong through hard work and humility. If you are strong, stay humble, remember what it took to become strong to stay strong.  Fortify both your physical and mental.  You should never put yourself down, and call yourself low value.  You are a man that has room to improve, that is all.  Value is subjective... who is validating your value? Is it you?  Are you saying you are low value because that's how women perceive you?  Clinging on to your value as a man, based on someone else's opinion is the worst thing you could do. Learn to reject external validation. You do not need this. 

Know that you are accountable for every decision you make for yourself and no one else is doing that for you.  If you listen to someone else's suggestions, it is you who is accepting this.   If you decide to eat food you want to eat, that's also on you.  You make these decisions.  

The most important thing you can do for yourself is understand how your own mind works and how you can convince yourself to be what you want to be.  When you're chasing your goals, never half ass, always put 100% effort, persist and don't give up when you make mistakes.  

Good luck on your journey."
1651,"Thats the point of mgtow. To better yourself for YOU,   gotta get down to the 1600 to 2000 calorie a day range bud. I eat a bacon/tomatoe/cheese omelette for breakfast, for lunch a chicken breast, veggie, mashed potatoes and a yogurt. Dinner is a snack...usually a pbj or a protein bar. Drink a decent amount of water and stay away from soda pop and candies. Its hard at first but your body will adjust. You gotta want it man. Do this for a month and i promise you wont believe your progress. Oh...and NO ALCOHOL lol.

1652,"Sugar creates the same dopamine spike as cocaine.  It is addictive. I think of sugar addiction like smoking, I've seen how tough it is to quite smoking, well sugar is no different.  The fact you already lowered your cola intake I think is a win.

Too much sugar and other refined carbs will keep your insulin levels high and make it tough to loose weight.  Insulin tells your fat cells to store energy (you want them to release energy) and it also blocks Leptin from working in your brain.  Leptin is what makes you feel full and is created by your fat cells.  If sugar wasn't screwing up the harmonies as you put weight on you would naturally just start feeling full sooner and eat less.

I started at 340 as well and by following a non strict keto diet and fasting I dropped to 260 in like 6 months.  I am currently hanging around 285 but then I do eat too much sugar/refined carbs currently.  It's not all about calorie reduction, hormones play a huge factor too (more then just insulin and leptin).

Some good sources are Jason Fung, Robert Lustig, Tim Noakes.  You can find books or if you are like me there are youtube videos of presentations and interviews.

Please don't make an effort to do this to get a woman; out of the frying pan into the fire. 

From personal experience: your task is like rolling a giant boulder. It will take a lot of exausting energy to get it rolling and seem futile. Make the effort your goal, not the results.

1678,"The first achievement in life must always be proper food, good exercise and good sleep. If a man doesn't take care of these, whatever he achieves in life is utterly useless.

These are simple things and yet is very hard for most people. These are routine things that if done well greatly enhance your physique and energy levels which improve your mindset which improves your overall success in life.

Eating a consistent healthy meals properly spaced out and making a promise that you cook your meals as much as everyday till you are habituated to it that you do not want outside food. Cooking is a valuable skill that must be taught to every kid otherwise you will be lazy and start looking for fast junk food that ends up doing more damage to you..

Always making sure having good sleep. Yes. Here needs discipline. You go to sleep and wake up at same time as much as possible everyday,. This also requires discipline.

Always making sure you get to walk and do few strength training exercises and bit of yoga and meditation combined. This also requires bit of self-discipline.

If you can consistently do this everyday, you are already a great achiever in life. Your physique will be manly, perfect and energetic.

Remember you are not low value. Just that you did not have proper direction in life and that is okay. It can always be changed gradually. It is tough but it can be done.

Just as with anything, our minds also should be managed. Most people let their minds road around and stressed and anxious which leads to addictions, illness and other self-destructive habits. One must learn to know what is important and what is not important, what is essential to one's life and what is not essential. Then let your mind work around these principles. Your thoughts also will align with these values. And you will see that your mind will actually start working for you rather than against you. Mind is awesome power. If you think low value, it feeds back on itself and your body and mind will work to make low value through depression and feelings of low self-esteem. Do not worry about what others may perceive you. Rather change how you perceive yourself even if you are fat, you can start seeing yourself more positively rather than negatively.

Instead of society defining you and validating you, rather validate yourself from inside. seek validation and value from inside of you. It helps you keep peace and happiness no matter the outer circumstances.

You need not achieve big things in life to feel better. All you need to do is take care of yourself properly without falling into addictions, self-destructive habits and behaviors. This - self-reliance -  is itself a big achievement. It is smaller things that you do each day that make your life meaningful and purposeful. If done well, it adds up and makes you feel great and better about yourself."

In my case, the main problem was literally buying too much food, I would eat it all quickly and then go back to the store a few days later to buy too much again. I was spending like $600 a month on groceries alone, which I now halved. Impose a restricted food budget upon yourself so you don't buy more than you need, and save the rest.

I was addicted to sugary drinks too, so I switched to diet soda. Well, I'm still addicted, but at least it's 0 cal. I can drink 2 liters in a day if I want to and it's still gonna be 0 cal. I always buy a bunch of 12-packs whenever they go on sale. This is the one and only thing I don't limit myself for; helps me cope with the constant hunger pangs. So far so good."

1686,"even  if you was rich buddy it would not change society perception of you .   any person who is not manipulated into being a cuck  beta provider will be a ' low value ' male.   So if you are going to improve yourself do it for you not women not society otherwise you are just wasting your time .the whole low value thing has been coined by woman to shame men into compliance,   go on the fds reddits you will see it posted all over there .  its just shaming language bro. if it take you until your mid 30's to have something then it is what it is  dont give a shit for what over people have or what other people think,."

1688,A big problem with major weight-loss is you lose alot of strength.
1689,Stop measuring your value based on societies and women standards.Society and women don't give an ounce of shit about you so why should you?
1690,High protein diet with intermittent fasting. Swim and walk...youll b fine my mate👍
1691,"Good job mate! No need to talk down your progress by comparing to what others define healthy. You are not a statistic. Just keep doing what you’re doing and your progress will be more appetizing to your ambition than sugar laced foods.

Might help to keep a weekly vlog (for yourself mostly), to keep track of your progress and maybe spot some negative thought patterns you have. Kinda like a cheap version of mental health care. Pointless to train the body of you leave your head without a coach :)"
1692,"This is what this sub should be about. Men taking the initiative to improve themselves and their lives and inspiring others to do the same.

1718,"Am I lazy. Well I used to be. There have been periods in my life where I exercised off and on. Fortunately those periods don't last as long as they use to. 

I have been​ training consistently. Before the lockdown here in the UK I was going to the gym lifting weights, doings abs, cardio and swimming. Currently I am training at home with a pair of dumbbells, ez bar and other home training equipment. 

Fasting is something I have done in the past however currently I am focusing on cutting out calories a stage at a time, cutting out unhealthy foods and generally eating more healthier.

It's like a lifelong alcoholic getting clean and then telling everyone not to drink or being a lifelong pot smoker but supporting keeping it illegal. It's great and all, but people usually have to play the field in order to get it out of their system. Just be careful when you play the field and you'll be fine.

I wouldn't expect a 20 year old to remain a lifelong loner just because of a saying some 50 year old wrote after doing the exact opposite. It doesn't make the sayings not true, but a 20 year old will feel deprived if he actually takes this advice, in my opinion."

I was the only one who responded with civility. Soon after we're both banned. This sub is much nicer anyway, I was getting tired of the memes."
1821,Nicely done bud on the mega-thread. I support this idea to keep the posts about being banned from the cess pool that is MGTOW1.
1822,"Agreed.

Does being banned from r/MGTOW stop you from seeing all posts on there or does it just mean that you can't submit your own posts?"
1823,They seem to be banning constructive posts and encouraging the women hatred.   It does a disservice to men to be not exposed to material to help them get over their red pill rage.
1824,"MGTOW1 is a fucking joke, the mod team are such a bunch of idiots and they also are doing eveything they can to turn it into an echo chamber, and as we all know the instant you do that you collapse on the inside because you no longer have the ability to justify and reason your opinion.

MGTOW1 is Cancer."
1825,"Banned for stating blatantly that mgtow should pursue interest unrelated to women 

Who the fuck woulda thought "
1826,I got banned for saying leaving someone elses child to rot is immoral.
1827,"got banned from r/mgtow twice.  Both times for criticizing  ""dear Leader"" (fucking Trump) in response to idiotic posts praising him.  Politics should be on the sidebar as not allowed and I mostly could ignore the Freeper types on that sub but over time the stupidity just got under my skin.   Also, too many ""victims"" there.  Pretty sure I pissed some people off pointing that out.  Sure, things are somewhat stacked against men in our society, especially white men right now, but if you stand back and objectively look at things it is mostly background noise.   I will take being a white male in this society any day, we are NOT oppressed and if you have half a brain it is not hard to compete and succeed.   Thank god I am not saddled from birth with the crutch of ""victimhood"" like women and other groups are.

And I can say as far as ""MGTOW"" as a concept, probably 90+% of of guys on r/mgtow are just not there.   It seems more of an AA for men in pain dealing with redpill truths.    I wish them goodluck in their pursuit of ""mgtow"", its not for everyone thats for sure.   But FFS keep the reich wing political BS out of it. 

 I say this as a 60 year old, never married, no kids, original ""confirmed bachelor"", retired early, financially independent ""loner"".    Lots of women in my past but could never let go of my freedom."
1828,I got banned 6 months ago. My last post got over a thousand upvotes. I asked the mod why i was banned. He just mocked me. From what i observed they spend all their time trashing women. Thats not mgtow to me.

1830,"So, I just got banned from mgtow1 and I gotta say it's hilarious. I pointed out the difference between incels and mgtow and within 2 min got banned.

1831,Got banned for saying a comic about transgenders seemed to have little to do with mgtow.  So fucking sensitive.
1832,"Not banned yet, but the negativity about women has gotten completely out of control. I saw a post about sex dolls and artificial wombs, upvoted to high heavens, and I am afraid it is a space that is just too focused on getting back at women. Always delving into all the negative sides of feminine nature as if there is NOTHING inherently good or beneficial from it. It's too much. I mean I want to protect myself, but I do not have to actively assume every woman is the spawn of... you get my point...."
1833,"> Did you just get banned from /r/MGTOW?

Why yes I did...I've never seen a more pathetic group than that.  Guess they need their safe space."
1834,"I left voluntarily. Too many self-defeatist foreveraloners that are not interested in self development. Not interested in sharing life strategies. Too eager to fall for the clickbait media. I've also been guilty of this in the past. It's very easy to get into the bitter loop concerning feminists. But brandishing all women as having the same agenda is just as stupid as a libtard saying all men are toxic. It serves no purpose. It brings nothing to the quality of your life. MGTOW subreddit in its current state is an echo chamber.

I've seen a conversion from when the incel subreddit got banned. Most of the MGTOWs who shared their wisdom are no longer on the subreddit. A MGTOW I met in London even calls them menimists and refuses to go back on there. A few good posters remain. But they are drowned out by the overwhelming outrage porn.

It's a sinking ship. And that's because visiting the subreddit leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. A hyper focus on the worst of female nature. The worst of society.

Men need male spaces though. Men need brotherhood. Is this subreddit got the markings to provide that? I'm not entirely sure at the moment. However, for me it's time to turn a new leaf. Get back to the original intention of MGTOW. It wasn't to shun yourself away from society. It was to avoid commitment aka marriage and anything that does not serve men on his path. It was to place your hobbies and interests at the forefront. To realise that you're more than just your biological imperative. And I kind of deviate here from most MGTOWs, I don't think hooking up with women is bad if you are smart about it. Essentially the first inception of MGTOWs were the single bachelor types. I think through MGTOW subreddit getting popular. With YouTubers echoing clickbait  like TFM reading out the horror stories of gynocentrism it's become a bastardised version of itself.

Anyways, just my thoughts."
1835,"They'll ban you if they think you're the Chad type.

So much inexperience with those guys on there, as a 34 year old who has been through a lot with women, they became pretty transparent.  Got easy to tell who hadn't been with a girl and who had. "
1836,Banned in the middle of the night while I slept. Can't think of what made them do this.
1837,"Just got banned yesterday, not sure what I said that was so triggering. Never thought I'd say it but that sub is teeming with negativity, it's off my radar moving forward. "

Only comment there. Got banned within minutes"
1839,I got downvoted to hell just for questioning why they would actively avoid women 24/7. Seems a bit like the old Braincells subreddit. 
1840,"Well, I always wondered what you had to get banned from /MGTOW and I found out! Apparently, well thought out answers and trying to have an adult conversation with mildly differing opinions is all it takes. "
1841,"Just unsubbed at the same time as getting banned, apparently you can't ask why an idiot 20 year old got banned, I started to talk about the purity spiral and the creation of there own bubble vs free speech that I've seen kill many communities since athieism+

I predicted that sub will be going down within 18 months because they have lost focus on the welfare of men instead preferring to have a bitch fest at women. "
1842,"I just got banned from mgtow lol. They turned into a fucking hatred incel group. The amount of man jumping on high horse and virtue signaling there is astounding. I dont know a reason why I got banned. I had many good convos there but I guess ban was for 1 comment in thread where guy was virtue signaling to others about not wanting to fuck that chick he posted that actually looked amazing to me. I suggested that he hates looks too much and maybe he likes a dick in a butt. These guys turn into sjw feminazi that try to control freedom of speech. I dunno maybe they will make safety rooms for those incels soon too. There is a difference in not liking some women behavior and just her looks...
"
1843,I am relieved I finally got banned. /r/MGTOW is full of toxic and hypocritical incels.
1844,"I challenged a so called MGTOW on his slut shaming of an Asian female. I asked the question why he was so concerned about something he had no choice over and no control over.

His response was to launch into a personal tirade about doing whatever he wanted to do. He then attacked me personally and to top it off resorted to racial attacks. This from a MGTOW who has never met me and doesn't know anything about me.

I am convinced that r/MGTOW has been feminised and corrupted by feminists and anti-MGTOW shills. To be banned from the subreddit for having a discussion about MGTOW while the racist idiot sits in there doesn't surprise me. The fact that a text if admin would take sides with a racist does surprise me.

Race has nothing to do with MGTOW. However on racist Reddit subredfits this is not only permissible. It is supported and it is promoted. I will not be going back into that subreddit even as a lurker. It has become a hive of scum and villainy."
1845,Got banned. No explanation. No reply when I questioned.
1846,"Yes. I did. I've also been banned from r/IncelTears and r/TrueFemcels. I was going to give r/feminism a shot, but I absolutely refuse to visit that sub under any circumstances. 

You either hate the targeted gender of those subs or get out. Reason and neutrality are not welcome. 

Honestly, I'm convinced incels have taken over r/MGTOW. They're just so hateful and miserable over there. It's depressing. Do you know not one of those men have posted anything to honor Father's Day? They're so busy hating women they forgot to show all the dads out there love today.

HAPPY FATHER'S DAY TO ALL OF THE GOOD FATHERS OUT THERE!

I didn't have mine, so I admire those who love and care for their children."
1847,"I got banned for jokingly saying ""who hurt you"". "
1848,"Haha brilliant. I was banned for saying they over implied a negative relationship from a single photo. A man sat on a train with a bit of a somber look, that’s just the London look mate. 

These boys are salty "
1849,"That sub is infested with looser that got cucked and now are crying.

99% of them are beta."
1850,Got banned for telling someone who questioned why the whole sub was hating on captain marvel that the sub is basically incels 2.0 and referring him here 
1851,I think the mod's girlfriend hijacked his account.
1852,"If you haven't already been banned, just leave anyway. Fuck that sub. It belongs to the incels now. "
1853,got banned  from posting because i asked why we have to be so angry/hating of women lol. I mean i know we are different and MGTOW/Redpill is about that. But we should i feel be working more for Mens benifit and our growth then venting and angry with women.
1854,What’s happening with the ppl being banned so much? Who’s running the MGTOW? It seems the ppl who are being banned are more MGTOW than not. I was just banned yesterday for no good reason
1855,"Apparently, this warranted a ban:
  
""True love exists, but it's super rare in our generation.

I know these older couple, pretty well off and retired at about 50? The dude fell sick and was hospitalized, they had the option to discontinue treatment as it seemed hopeless (and was expensive as hell). I would've pulled the plug tbh but the lady did everything she could to treat him; risking their retirement plans.

Thankfully, he didn't have to go through the full course of expensive treatments and they're now enjoy their golden years.

I found out that they were each other's firsts and both worked hard together to earn their wealth. Guy's not a chad too.""
  
Some guy responded with ""Go. Away.""
  
""Not sure why you're so hostile. If you disagree with me, we can have a proper discussion.

Think of it this way.

Getting a unicorn is like winning a lottery. It's so rare that you might as well treat it as non-existent.

But are there lottery winners? Yes.

Should I spend a lot of resources in trying to win the lottery? No.

But the fact remains that there are lottery winners.""
  
Same guy responded with ""Wrong.""
  
I reported the last one for low effort and got the banned message shortly."
1856,"Subscriber for two years.
Banned twice in two months.  
No explanation from mods.  
I'm done.  
Don't need r/mgtow to go my own way."
1857,"Aaaaaand banned. Never offended any member. Bashed women like I was supposed to do. Wonder what kind of interesting posts from other banned or shadow banned users I could never read.

The mods are probably 40yo, red-haired women who have hit the wall and chain smoke cigarettes inside their apartments while watching reruns of desperate housewives."
1858,This guy was saying OP’s dead brother (who had committed suicide) was a failure so I called him out and got banned when he told me to fuck off and I replied that he should fuck his anime pillow. Is MGTOW full of furries and anime queers?
1859,Lol I said MGTOW2 is a fantastic subreddit and got banned from MGTOW...lol
1860,"I wasn't banned. I left myself. r/MGTOW sadly turned away from a supportive group for men who don't want commitments into a nightmare fuel of incels and alike. I am so disgusted with myself for actually falling for their misogynistic trap for months... 

Well, i guess that's just another dialectic. My life prior to MGTOW was antithesis and MGTOW was thesis. Now it's time for synthesis."
1861,A friend from MGTOW PMed me about having just gotten banned.  They gave him no reason why.  I made a post asking how someone can contest a ban in the event of a mistake.  My post vanished immediately.  This makes me think they have no interest in running MGTOW with integrity.  I invited him here to MGTOW2.
1862,"Yes I got banned from r/mgtow for ""concern trolling"" on my old account. Nearly all the karma I had was from upvotes in that sub, but they banned me anyways. 

Yeah sorry no sorry, but when someone is complaining about not getting laid and is saying they're going to buy a gun and let fate decide, then yeah I'd say concern is warranted. 

I'm hopeful that here I can see the good posts on how mgtow helps men be better at being themselves, keeps them out of the trap of the marriage contract, and provides cautionary tales based on our own learning experiences with women. 

And mods for inevitable showing of the incels here, please hand out the bans like candy. Those fools are subreddit cancer."
1863,"Been banned because.. I have absolutely no idea, honestly. Not even incel-bashing, defending women, or anything like that (it really isn't my type), just a sudden ban out of nowhere, maybe because of a talk with a guy about how improvement is important but saying that hard work will always work is false, since this guy's posts got deleted? Who knows. 

For a sub that wants to reach the 100k ans is so proud of it, randomly banning people doesn't exactly sound like a smart idea."
1864,[deleted]
1865,"Well, I suppose Ill bring myself over to this sub after getting banned for some random comment.  After reading some 2d waifu BS and other simping shit I dared to point it out and got banned. Hope to see some good content here. Cheers."
1866,"I got banned and I vaguely remember a comment I said that might have gotten me banned.

The post was saying something along the lines of: ""Society should not support single moms choices, instead society should penalize and ostracize them"".

My comment was saying something along the lines of: ""I agree that society should not support single moms choices, but I'm not sure if penalizing and ostracizing them is helpful"".

Bam, banned!

Nuance is lost on the admin of r/MGTOW"
1867,Got banned for saying 'Great post! Have you tried r/MGTOW2 ?' on a rare post that was actually about a man going his own way. 
1868,Got banned for calling them out on their soyboy humor
1869,"I didn’t get banned,but I saw the direction it was going. "
1870,"Ah shiet the sad thing is that there are still uplifting posts about people doing cool things with their lives after going their own way, and I want to support that stuff.

But then I find myself getting caught up in some sketchy shit that I lowkey regret commenting about or even just looking at. 

Fuck man. I dunno how to feel now. "
1871,"I got banned too, why? No idea!

Unsubscribed."
1872,I was banned after clearly pointing out that most of the guys on /r/mgtow sound like my catty hairdresser (the women-hating kind)
1873,"Shadowbanned for pointing out that a poster had fabricated an AITA thread to make a wife look like they hated their husband having friends, when in reality the husband's friend was being an asshole. Here we go self-reinforcing beliefs!"
1874,"Got banned about a hour ago.  I responded to a post where the guy was talking about women starting drama at work.  I proceed to tell him to move on and women talk smack about each other a lot and this dude proceeds to ask me if I'm slow.  I respond that obviously he hasn't moved on if he made a 8 paragraph story about the entire thing.  

&#x200B;

That was why I was banned. Not even a feminist sub would've banned me for that. I'm guessing the guy I responded to was a mod, oh well."
1875,I got banned from r/feminism and r/mgtow .. go figure. lol
1876,"Got banned by defending a well known anti-feminist, because the anti-feminist was female. Go figure.  


r/MGTOW is honestly more toxic than r/Feminism"
1877,Banned for saying I was bi sexual
1878,"Got banned and was not even given a reason.

&#x200B;

Shows you everything you need to know about them. Those aren't true MGTOW and if they are that cowardly on the internet, you have to wonder how bad they are in real life. That's also why that subreddit attracts the lowest quality posters, who mostly seem to want to brag that they have money and women chase them now, which is ridiculous. If you want to attract women that's the opposite of MGTOW."
1879,"Just got banned for trying to talk about what users think the MGTOW subreddit should be for. I guess that comes under the heading of ""concern trolling""? IDK. IDC. What I do know is , r/MGTOW is definitely not the place to talk about it."
1880,Banned for calling them out on being worse than incels lol. Like banning me is going to do literally anything.
1881,"I was banned, no reason given whatsoever. What's going on? I've been a brilliant participant AFAIK. Oh wait, except for one comment where I said I'm not a fan of TRP at all, that I thought MGTOW was better. "
1882,"This is the comment that got me banned 2 months ago. When they banned me I realized they did me a favor. 

“I’m glad others are seeing this trend and speaking up as well. I first subscribed to MGTOW because there were good articles about self improvement and building better habits. The trend seems more and more externally focused and less and less about self improvement.

Repressing others (individuals or groups) does not free my mind, it traps it in a negative feedback loop of anger, fear and resentment. All of which I want to let go of and put down.”"
1883,I just got banned 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
1884,"Hey I got banned for calling an incel a fat fuck who can't improve his life, posting how we are not an incel sub and asking for hobbyist/woodworking pictures."
1885,"Just got banned -- no explanation.  No fucking clue as to why.

Yup, and guess what -- you guys are here, too.  Not a surprise."
1886,I got banned after posting a picture posted on a separate subreddit. It was about a mother who had an armless child and emotionally abused him to the point he decided to commit suicide.
1887,"I got banned some time ago for asking a question about what French ""yellow jacket"" protests have to do with MGTOW.
It used to be a good subreddit, but it turned into an echo chamber. Sad."
1888,"got banned because of my post here [https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/aqjrjo/to\_incels/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/aqjrjo/to_incels/) 

its really sad to see r/MGTOW community is full of incels and woman hating, anyway good to see this subreddit is unlike the original one and positive."
1889,"Just happened to me, honestly I just thought to look up MGTOW on reddit and found out the MGTOW sub is filled with women hating incels. The thread was the guy talking on Facebook with a girl about that the dogs are better than women, because dog won't divorce you and dog won't take your kids, and asked her what is the womens argument and she said vagina, he was like ""mhm, ok, what else?"". And one of responses there was ""vaginas stink anywhere, I don't need your disgusting hole"" or something, so I responded ""is this sub just riddled with incels?"" And they proved me right, by banning me. Is that really what MGTOW is about?"
1890,Got banned and 12 hours without a reply as to why I was banned. My post was about my concern about MGTOW community that I've heard from the YouTuber Angry MGTOW. Apparently angry incels got ahold of being mods there.
1891,"I got banned for replying to a post with saying how it seems like they were trying to discredit women who actually worked hard for their achievements. They really really hate women apparently, and also hate being called out on it. "
1892,"Just got banned today for no reason. No explanation. It used to be my favourite sub and I’m still MGTOW but fuck that place and it’s dictator mods. I don’t know why but after getting banned, it affected me a lot and I was upset the whole fucking day. "
1893,"I got banned a few days ago and I am overly pissed. I’ve been in that sub for like 2 years, shortly after I made an account, I asked someone for the story of why they hated women simply Bc it was a hate post. Idk why but I got banned so fast"
1894,"Just dropping in to say I'm not banned from there, but you can bet your ass I would be if I opened my mouth, because those guys are just nasty. I think this place is a great alternative, keep up the good work!"
1895,"I was banned from mgtow for no known reason, though I suspect it's due to my trenchant observations about men and women that threaten to explode mgtow out of it's gatekept box."
1896,"Not banned but today I decided to abandon it after seeing people getting censored for not wanting to hate on the black hole scientist for no reason. Mgtow mods are incel cucks now. I always knew a fragment of the subs population were bitter incels, but it seems it has reached critical mass (no pun intended)"
1897,[deleted]
1898,"Just got banned! MGTOW saved my life and set me on the self actualization path 5.5 years ago. I deleted my reddit because I was addicted and now 2 years of lurking has me making an account again because: I finally came out to myself as bisexual after 13 years of living in denial. I reckon they banned me based solely on my other subreddits. I even asked for clarification and got no reply!  hahaha

&#x200B;

I think [mgtow.com](https://mgtow.com) is compromised too.

thank you"
1899,Banned today out of the blue.
1900,"Don't know if I'm fully band, but when I try to comment on any thread in that sub I get the ""Something went wrong"" error message

Funny, the other 10 subs I can still comment just fine.

The fag moderators over at mgtow probably got mad at me for referring to Game of Thrones as a Soap Opera"
1901,Oh shit didn’t think so many people were banned.  I got banned for asking why they didn’t believe they could fall in love
1902,"Just saw their latest post complaining about the double standard applied to angry white men vs raging females.

Only the example used for angry white men are the Charlottesville rioters.

They fell for the trap.  Quickest way to consign MGTOW to oblivion is to associate it with racism, which has nothing to do with MGTOW."
1903,"I don't know what I did, I don't know what I typed, ... I did get into a little spat with an idiot on a post, but I did not threaten them in any way, or use any abusive language as far as I know (just put a dipshit in his/her place by calling them a child, and to 'grow up' or whatever) and I always followed the rules on the sidebar. The moderators are not replying to my reply to their 'ban message' (although they said ""reply to this message to get an explanation for your ban"") ... so, it appears the mods on r/MGTOW are not doing their job in a timely fashion, or they are corrupt. I'll miss that sub, but there is r/MGTOW2 and other forums on the internet to mingle with like-minded cats such as yourselves from time to time. You won't hear from me much, but I'll sure enjoy your company if you don't mind me hanging around..."
1904,"I have no idea why I received a ban. Never tried to play whiteknight or not AWALT game. I have been in sub for more than a year. 

Asked mods nicely. No reply yet. Most likely they start to suffer from entitlement disease and inflated ego like Instagram thots once the sub mark passed over 100,000. Screw them /r/MGTOW"
1905,"I was banned.  I don't see why.  I asked the mods twice and received no answer.

It comes to the point I suspect the sub had been infiltrated by white knights who do what from their perspective is damage control : they let most things pass but I may have written something they really don't like.  I can't know what for sure."
1906,Really sad to see the sub turn to shit filled with hate. Call someone out on their bs and get banned.
1907,"Someone said women age like milk, I got banned for disagreeing and saying Jennifer Aniston aged well 


It's sad that they are so angry that that would set them off"
1908,"Someone posted an Oscar Wilde picture with a quote saying most people's lives are someone else's, their words, quotes, their thoughts from other's minds, with the headline 'Women in a nutshell' or something.

I asked, surely you can see the hypocrisy in this?

Banned.

WTF?"
1909,I just asked why most of the posts in their forum references women. Isn’t that the opposite goal?
1910,"banned I don't even know why, send them messages telling them I was a good member for almost 2 years. no reason. anyway realized that they have a dark agenda. I am MGTOW but doesn't have to hate on women. Human being need to reproduce but just not with me."
1911,"Lol those guys are just male version of feminists. They fantasize about the thing they supposedly walked away from. All that red pill rage got old and I had to call them out on it. Got banned. 


It's too negative for me anyways. All the talk about the world will end is annoying. No matter how crazy women will get, humans will still reproduce. 
They never talk about inspiring things or self improvement. Just ""I hate wahmen memes"". 


I get it they're crazy, let's move on."
1912,"i got banned because i said the comic posted was not true. lmao 

also, the rules; like what counted as bullshit? saying that i’m not a thot for disagreeing with you or?"
1913,"i just got banned for saying unfortunately theres no proof so we wont know whether this is true

&#x200B;

and another person agreed with me as well

&#x200B;

funny thing is that i support mgtow! loled so hard at the bunch of losers over there :D"
1914,The MGTOW mods act like a bunch of shitty little girls. They just ban anyone who says anything that makes them feel bad and don't even have balls to justify. It's a sub run by little babies.
1915,[removed]
1916,[deleted]
1917,"I don’t get. No reason nothing, just banned .
Is MGTOW getting inundated with SJWs again? "
1918,"There should be a rule in this sub to not go throwing around insults at other posters just because you disagree with them. I see one troublemaker in particular that I would ban. If you can't make up a good argument that doesn't involve calling someone a loser, incel, throwing out F bombs at them, and the like, you should really just go back to the first sub where you belong. "
1919,"Permission to come aboard captain? 

I honestly don't know why or how I got banned and I tried to ask, but never got anything back.

Oh well. I still want to share a space with Men Going Their Own Way."
1920,I got banned for saying if all mgtow dont have kids then how can it effectively spread? Im still looking for an answer or discussion lol 
1921,"I'm banned because (pick one)
 
- single father
- pornstar/producer
- ""show my face"" in my mgtow vids
- i criticize mgtow/feminism origins
- i'm black/african yet not a tyrone
- i support sex workers (am one myself) and critized the camgirl audit
- i don't advise entirely abandoning women in your life
- if pussy and companionship didn't feel good like dope nobody would care about these forums
 
im shimmy and i approve this message"
1922,"The mods basically bans anyone that doesn't agree with women bad, men good.

It is a shame."
1923,"Just got mine, complaining about the incel invasion turning the sub into a shithole."
1924,I got banned and I don’t know what I said that was wrong
1925,"I just got banned as well, for what? Who the hell knows, I must of pissed off a cuck or two and they reported me for being a meanie. "
1926,I got banned for mentioning the whorish nature of wahman
1927,"You guys were right all along. I was just banned for ""concern trolling"", which is just an ad hominem from people with very black and white views on some topic, against anyone more nuanced then themselves. They wouldnt even cite a specific example when asked. None of my comments were in the negative either. I was banned from the mod ThatCard . "
1928,"I made a few posts that got ALOT of upvotes... popped up on admins radar I guess. Told me to “change my name if I want to contribute, we don’t got time for trolls” 

I think they just don’t like people racking up too much karma... all I can think of. But I’m glad, MGTOW2 is much more mature and analytical.

My name is far too good to change anyway. "
1929,MGTOW is literal cancer. Full of self entitled little boys who blame women for their insecurities.
1930,"Got banned for clarifying my post in Rant stating that I support the good part of MGTOW but really don't like the woman bashing and generalization of all women. Responses in Rant were supportive and friendly, those in MGTOW when it was cross-posted were vicious, narrow-minded and hateful. Super glad that's not the entire MGTOW picture :) "
1931,"FINALLY got banned. One of those pesky incels did a crosspost about some probably normal girl who was having doubts about her relationship, and his reaction was to call her a...well, you'll see.

I told him to chill, because BOTH genders are susceptible to having relationship doubts. Cue the downvote party, and the subsequent ban.

I regret nothing.

See for yourselves:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/bafrj2/what\_a\_f\_c/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/bafrj2/what_a_f_c/)"
1932,"Well, it happened. I got banned..

I couldn’t take the misogyny anymore and had to call them out, which ended in ppl actually agreeing with me moments before my banning. Thank you for creating this sub, I just wish I knew about it sooner. 

[post that got me banned]

Believe it or not, I remember when this sub use to be a place of discussion, a place where men turned to - to better themselves on their new found path, a place where men have chosen to go their own way to rectify what’s been torn apart do to the aftermath’s of failed marriages and relationships. Now almost all of that helpful knowledge and sound advice is being clouded by articles and rants that reflect misogyny, and at times, pure black pilled hatred. 

I understand that a lot of us come to this sub with red pill rage and need that outlet, but that rage will be the very death of this sub. Downvote this into oblivion for all I care, but I know there are men here who feel the same, if they haven’t already moved on. 

Seriously, what the fuck has this sub become..?"
1933,"I've been a regular active user at r/mgtow, however [I came across this post](https://web.archive.org/web/20190413023804/https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/bcaewn/feminism_is_literally_late_stage_cancer/) and realized there was some serious misinformation going around. First it’s from a TV show, second she’s literally playing a White Nationalist. However it seems the mgtow mods don't like reality and removed my comment (and similar ones), followed by a ban. [Original screenshot of my comment.](https://i.imgur.com/UBn8jUS.png) They still have the original post up with the flair ""*Brain Raped*"". I noticed r/MGTOW isn't the same as it was 3 years ago.

1934,"Interesting to see that so many guys get banned.

I believe I got shadow banned, I don't know why, I didn't break the rules or said something not MGTOW.

I'd say that 75% of my comments won't show up. It sucks, I had genuine advice to give and also genuine, important questions to ask. What a shame."
1935,Lol I got banned for disagreeing with something a long time ago
1936,I got banned by those faggots. don't know what happened

My comment:

[Just out of curiosity, can’t this be applied to males as well? A lot of my mates are pretty promiscuous dudes and have had plenty of one night stands. So with this logic, are they no different from the women this excerpt aims to shame? 

Not trying to ruffle feathers, just kinda curious on the stance about men that do the things MGTOW hate about women (cheating, sleeping around, using another person for any kind of temporary/ personal gain, etc.). I try not to keep dudes like that in my friend circle anymore,  I can certainly say I’ve seen a lot of men do these things that women are so demonized for.  I’ve certainly been fucked over by the opposite sex, but a lot of my mates have done the same to some genuinely nice women. 

As a single male, I wonder about the MGTOW movement and if it is too extreme of an ideology for me. Don’t mind the GMOW part, since that is the life I tend to lean towards as an introvert, but I love my mother, and sisters, and have met genuinely kind women.]


Hopefully some of you in this sub can answer this without me being banned first. I’m looking for camaraderie with people who aren’t so relationship focused and driven by the need for someone else in their life to make them happy, but MGTOW might be too extreme or me."
1940,"I got banned after another user said that unless you have at least a 4 year degree, you are useless to society. I called that user out, said that's some very feminine shaming tactics, and said user must be a troll woman in disguise."

I had atleast the right to a response"
1944,"I  got banned from MGTOW subreddit. I maybe used a bit of harsh words. But I was not  trolling, I genuinely expressed my opninion after I perused their  subreddit. I am not against the freedom to ban or censor an individual,  All subreddits have their rules and regulations.

I  am one of those dude who thinks we men are not that oppressed as the  MGTOW subreddit or redpill portay. I agree some part of the relationship  issue. Where some men are treated unfairly. Other than that the  subreddit is full of negative generalizing of feminist, liberals, mass  media etc.

Also I found out that few of my points in the original thread does not relates to MGTOW ideology."
1945,"I got banned a few days ago, I replied within 10 minutes asking why and they still haven't given a reason. I expected better but they're just as bad as /r/feminism mods."
1946,"yep, just got banned, no idea why, asked why, twice, no answer, whoopee"
1947,Yeah I tried to suggest something. They didn't like that too much.
1948,I just got banned :/ I wasn’t told why. And I had such a warm reception when I made my posts. I’m so taken back.
1949,I got banned for calling them incels...all they do is complain about women like incels do. I haven’t seen any posts there about men issues or self improvement at all.
1950,Fucking hell that sub has gone down the gutter. Got taken over by actual incels and alt right cringe.

1954,I was banned.
1955,Thanks for making this. 
1956,This wouldn't be necessary any more than MGTOW itself if not for the current situation we find ourselves in. Men would not be bitching here about the MGTOW subreddit if not for the shitty arbitrary behavior of the current mods over there while many men would not be going mgtow if not for the shitty behavior of many women and the overall system that is highly unfair.
1957,"Yep 

I'm all for male independence, but I feel that constantly going around in a circlejerk of hating women just proves that the people who hang out there are clearly not over it. Being one sided and keeping an eye out for only bad women which fit the narritive in your head is just asking to get into a toxic mindset imo: vicareously playing the victim of a minority of women who play the victim to take advantage of men

It's a subreddit about independent men that discusses women 90% of the time. Which is kind of the opposite of the sub's title"
1958,"fwiw there's a form to report moderators

1964,"I got banned for replying to a post with saying how it seems like they were trying to discredit women who actually worked hard for their achievements. They really really hate women apparently, and also hate being called out on it. "
1965,"Yes.

After 2 years posting thousands of messages !!!

Are there female moderators on r/MGTOW  or just insecure incels ???

P.S.: Apparently banned because I said a guy (pictured in the OP) had an ""ugly body"" then got downvoted AF and replied ""they can be ugly if they wish""

1966,"I got banned for...
Well idk, either because I’m a chick or because I genuinely was trying to understand their logic- or both.. probably both.

I had pointed out that I was gaslighted by my ex boyfriend and somehow found myself at 19 years old paying all the rent, all the groceries, and meanwhile my ex boyfriend five years older than me- lying, cheating, and spending his money on a new bong or Xanax addiction- I was trying to point out that it wasn’t because he’s a man that he’s a shitty manipulative person.. 

I’m all for men feeling empowered without women.. but I found myself at mgtow because just like with “man haters”, neither gender should be held accountable for the world’s problems, or an individual’s problems.. and I was wondering what kind of logic they use since it does seem they blame women for all the world’s problems. 

I’d argue a lot of women’s problems are culturally pushed on women by other women, and same with men. 

And also, I have more male friends than female friends... like the two genders aren’t strictly romance based... but mgtow makes it out to be just a biological reproductive thing between the genders.. platonic relationships are important."
1967,I'm new to this subreddit and the r/ mgtow. I don't understand what happened or why this subreddit needed to be created. Can someone help out a bud and give me a little history?
1968,Its must be That_Card
1969,"Thanks! I think I got banned for genuinely good reasons at the time, but I have learned my lesson and hope to have intellectual discussions on the matter. "
1970,"yep, finally got banned.  I guess its because I said something about someones offtopic BS liberal bashing and you must only suck conservative cock to post there 

(no offense to conservatives in general)

but when someone says some bullshit Ill say something back and I dont care what kind of ""feels over reals"" they are dealing with.

its pretty obvious they are lapping up pure propaganda.  The other day they were raving about Putin ffs
"
1971,I was banned after contributing there for a year. I made a post title that may have made them think I was a woman. Maybe I was banned automatically by a bot or something. IDK But no mods will respond and it is stupid. Guess I will have to post here now.
1972,This is what happens when normies shilling as mgtows infiltrate the sub.
1973,An old account of mine was banned because I referred someone who complained about the state of that sub to MGTOW2. I suspect he was also banned.
1974,"Banned for literally saying on a post about Instagram attention whoring, word for word “this could be applied to men too tbf”. Go to reply to some prick who replies with some massively triggered response and couldn’t.

Been on there since it was at like 26k. Tbh, it’s gotten more and more astray and negative since about the 60k user mark. The amount of posts I see by users using tinder is just ridiculous. I’m all for doing what you want but surely using tinder is the exact opposite of what that sub is all about. Certainly was when I first found it.

No reply from the mods, so I’ve decided I am going to keep messaging them until I get a response. I don’t want back in, if anything this is a blessing, but just want an explanation.

I’m hoping this place is more about actually going your own way and sharing uplifting posts, rather than constant negativity and enjoying when some woman gets killed or whatever."
1975,"I got banned for no reason that I can think of, other than having deleted my main account due to a doxxing threat. Made one post about an old female friend calling me, me ignoring her, etc. It got 600 upvotes. Then, ban. Says ""banned for now"" which makes me wonder if it's temporary?"
1976,"*I just got banned for this post:*





**MGTOW does not equal political conservatism and the more you connect it the more you restrict progress**


I know this is pointless but whatever.

I'm as full on MGTOW as it gets but this does not and will never mean I vote repub.

Righties have to stop gatekeeping this ideology.

It's not political and has nothing to do with poltics.

You shoot yourself in the foot with this crap.

But this will go nowhere because this is an echochamber.

Regardless - Fuck Trump."
1977,"Just got banned a few moments ago for pointing out the sub has gone completely astray from what it used to be, the top posts are now literally women hating posts. Calling women cows, thots, disabled people and such... Then a few moments later got banned from  /r/MensRights for this post:

1978,"I got banned trying to confirm if a dude called desi MGTOW was lying about experiencing racism in that sub. Banned without an explanation or post reply.

I'm south asian and obviously this is to save me future conflict if my ethnicity is ever mentioned out of necessity

I've realized they toss repetitive memes and generally lack discussion to reinforce passionate dislike to wamen than move on. The brightside was witnessing beautiful photographs taken by some

It's as though they don't want men other than the like of themselves to go MGTOW and complain about blue pillers and simps making life harder for them whom are described to pander to the toxicity of a gynocentric establishment. Well, they pander to their own inflated ego with the disguise of unbiased reality"
1979,"I don’t think ever women in the world wants us dead or in their pocket but the numbers are rising and we need to break free from our biology. We are scared about other men because of our fear of being cuckolded and not having our genes progressed. What I am trying to say is a lot of these issues are to do with partners not matching ( ugly or ugly etc) and the capitalist system which is destroying the environmental and sociological spheres of life. We need to truly look at what we NEED in life not what we want. Because right now basic needs are not being met by 60% of the population. We are all connected and have the ability as a species to inflict pain on someone else emotionally and even subconsciously. 

It’s time we stopped saying left right etc and realised who the war is against- capitalism"

Not banned, But I am still going to be in both.   
I never knew or had any idea they ban men for... What?   
But I am open to both as long it doesn't turn into a war between both.   
I don't want MGTOW or MGTOW2 giving those cults/groups/organisation like feminist and other man hating groups a fighting chance to look like if they are winning and separate us.

1982,I was banned because I said I enjoy sex with Trans women. Don't know why that triggered anyone. I fuck who I want
1983,"Banned from /r/MGTOW for not suffering their delusion that MGTOW isn't racist and is welcoming to black men.  It most certainly is not.

Most of the white men on that subreddit have a long way to go before they're able to redpill themselves when it comes to matters of race.  They think, speak and behave from the same deluded hive mind of whiteness that blue-pillers think, speak and behave from.

Sent a hearty ""fuck you"" to the moderators as a parting salvo while I was at it.

Fucking racists."
1984,"Oh wow didn't think the banning was so wide spread.

Happened to me too.

I was making a half-joking point about men being able to get women through ""easy"" psychological tricks just like women do get men, not only through hard earned muscles and income. Apparently that was too PUA or diminished the argument that men have it way harder than women in life? Don't even know."

1995,"MGTOW went to shit for the exact same reason feminism did: the reactionary, fringe elements have become the leading voices of the movement.  I don't share the beef with feminism that a lot of MGTOW men believe that they have to have.  I know and understand that feminism, at it's core, is just as much about dismantling gender roles for men as it is women.  If I am to be honest, it was actual feminism that taught me self respect as a man and why I was compelled to a lot of the behaviors and concepts of myself, women and the world that I had, and that reason is patriarchy.  The same men who brag about how it's been primarily men who've created civilizations and governments are the same ones who deny the existence of patriarchy unironically and under the spell of cognitive dissonance.

It's ridiculous, actually.  

The most important thing, I think, for a man to remember is that he doesn't have to hate women to recognize and respect himself as a human being, and he doesn't have to hate himself to recognize and respect the humanity of women."
1996,"the real problem is not the act of ""getting banned."" 
you could always use throwaway accounts to get back there and I'm fine with it.
but the real probelm is that you ""can NOT contact them""! 
it doesn't matter how hard you try or if ""one of the old guys"" you were there, they will never respond you back, NEVER. 
I've been banned from dozens of subreddits, especially LGBTs, feminists, cuckoldery fetishists, adulteries, affair advices, cheating experiences, and I'm cool with getting banned from there, because they are my ""enemy"" territory, getting banned from there is EXPECTED. 
but when i got banned from mgtow? hell no, i wasn't expecting that. i was a men's right activist and a mgtow commentator at the time, and i always considered manosphere my FRIENDLY territory (except PUA and Incels, we don't share much in common) but i never expected a BAN from mgtow. 
the problem is, they won't tell you WHY they banned you and they'll never give you a SECOND chance ever again.
so if the moderators don't want to give a fuck about banned members, why should banned members give a fuck about them? 
and again, they're NOT the OFFICIAL mgtow, as they have confessed it themselves in subreddit. 

but after that, i can't trust any FRIENDLY territory anymore. 

I'm always expecting getting banned from MRA and MGTOW_2 now and i could never trust any territories anymore but i expect a little decency from moderators to respect me and tell me why i got banned and how i can get unbanned."
1997,I got banned because I mentioned I was a female who couldn't cook and why I couldn't (that was the topic of the post...).
1998,I got banned for posting comments from a feminist site and making satire.They could have warned me not out rite ban I was on there 2 years owell.
1999,"Seems like those cucks are banning everyone, screw em."
2000,Banned for being a sarcastic jerk. Most of those simps are just as bad as all the SJW and feminists they criticize. Their feelings get hurt so easily.
2001,Ah yes I see what you’re saying now.
2002,someone said MGTOW is for the enlightened people or something like that (i’ll find the link later) and i think i got banned for calling that out. i’ll add an edit later.

2004,"I got banned after putting a funny meme. 10 minutes later, POOF! This is actually a new account. I might resubscribe to them but I'm not posting anything."

2009,"I Just found MGTOW and got banned the same day. 

I went on there and found bunch of people complaining about women. Some of it seemed valid so I made a post asking what kind of women they find to be acceptable.

My mistake was I wrote I'm a 22F...
 2 minutes later I was banned from asking a question :(

I really just wanted to know what kind of woman they found acceptable."
2010,"I got banned a few months ago when I pointed out that their ""Catenary Arch"" project is a donation scam, and also that *all* the original Mods have somehow been replaced by new accounts without any Karma..."

2014,"r/waatgm is a decent one to check out.  Level headed, at least for now. "
2015,"Well...got banned from there...again.  Not sure if it was for recommending this sub to someone who sounded more reasonable than most of the ‘tard’s there...

Or if it was for telling people to read the article in a linked post and not the narrative driven synopsis that someone made.

Basically the synopsis said the woman got away with the crime, she was released no charges.  But the article said she was re arrested, charged with multiple crimes, and was undergoing a psych evaluation.

Proof positive that the narrative is the most important thing there and not any form of truth.  Sounds like /r/politics."
2016,"> Unpopular opinion:
> 
> Being in the rage phase and venting it on MGTOW1 is fine in the context that men rarely get this ooprtunity elsewhere.

I'm not sure that it's all that unpopular around here.  However I think that encouraging it is [a mistake](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/unique-everybody-else/201303/internet-ranting-and-the-myth-catharsis).  I'm not saying that people who are angry shouldn't be encouraged to discuss their anger and its underlying causes.  I am saying that the constant focus on negativity over on that sub is counterproductive and only helps hold people in that state and keeps them from moving on to better things."
2017,"Yes, but the majority of MGTOW1 posts/comments were all about misogyny, and anyone that thought otherwise was shunned by the masses. That isn't healthy "
2018,"I've been browsing again for the past few months and I've realised that I haven't really missed much. Just the same old memes as the past 3 years but with more inciting violence and incel garbage. Granted there are a few good posters there with thoughtful shit, like Dang, but they all just get drowned out or downvoted.

&#x200B;

I also got a lot of shit for responding to a woman and actually talking to her like a human being; it's absolutely pathetic how the sub has devolved into men vs women."
2019,"This (MGTOW2) sounds more like a Gentleman's club than a hate group, which MGTOW1 was turning into."
2020,"Speaking of memes, MGTOW1 tends to suffer from what I like to call - not knowing the rules of the internet.

Sure, we all know about rule 34. But what about 33? That's the one about lurking more.

Seems to me there's a bit too much spouting off at the mouth over there and not enough choosing words wisely."
2021,"I got banned for the same reason.  /R/MGTOW IS basically TRP AND REDPILLRAGE Refugees.

TRUE MGTOWS GIVE NO FUCKS."
2022,Same those guys have a hatred of women. 
2023,Only means you can't reply. 
2024,"Bro mgtow1 is for the dudes who subscribed to the blue pill and are regretting it. 

Mgtow is mgtow1 before the influx of TRP/INCELS.   We took red pill, got out of MG1.

2nd wave MGTOW.  MGTOW1 IS TRP and INCEL.  

Mgtow2 is better."
2025,"yup, then they mock people who ask them why is the only thing they do bitch about women when they are supposedly ""GTOW"", they think by they themselves talking about it, it doesn't make it a valid question."
2026,"I haven’t been given any reason at all, it was just out of the blue. Didn’t know was full of faggots there"
2027,they are basically half MGTOW half conservative propaganda at this point I guess

2029,I'm kinda sure they're 80% full of incels right now
2030,"They probably view guys sharing information which reveals they're not virgins as 'bragging'.

I don't think virgins should be shamed but from my experiences talking to a lot of them and reading their posts I get the idea that it's pretty much impossible for them to be fully red pilled."
2031,"Well, that makes sense for why I've been banned too then."
2032,"Sleeping is obviously a femoid kind of thing, LOL."
2033,"Me too. The only thing I'd posted that was remotely controversial recently was that i thought women were people and i tried to treat them like i do men. 

I pissed of some dude, so he probably reported me. After the moderation change, i think that someone is trying to turn ""mgtow"" into ""incel"" in the minds of the average person.

Edit: honestly, i should probably thank them. The place was slowly turning me back to constantly thinking about women.. "
2034,So now it is mgtow2 where the real men hang...
2035,wow...I swear reddit is a shit site to be on but the sign up process is too easy
2036,"I can tell you why I avoid women 24/7. Speaking only for myself:

1. Marriage is a raw deal for men. Everyone knows this. I dont want to subject myself to that kind of slavery.

2. Dating and girlfriends: Every girlfriend I've had has either cheated on me with someone who had more money or a better position in life. Monkey branching. I dont fault them for it now, it's just their nature. And I dont enjoy the feeling of a breakup when I was thinking everything was ok. Casual dating equates to more buying free dinners than romantic reward, and it's expensive I'd rather use those resources on my self. Also the breakup psycho factor. Consensual sex and turn into a rape claim that without any investigation at all can ruin your life. No thank you 

3. Women in the workplace: I am 100% professional all the time, and make sure I'm never alone with one. A false claim to HR about touching her butt or her being offended by a joke  can have you out on your ass faster than 5pm comes on a holiday weekend. It's not worth the risk.

4. Day to day life: they only talk to you if they want something from you. And I dont want to give them anything. I want to do what I want to do. 

Staying away from women keeps me focused, energized, and moving forward. It's the way I mgtow, and mgtow is freedom. "
2037,They're probably afraid of getting #metoo'd
2038,"Un, that's the point of MGTOW. No women= no chance of having your money stolen, no chance of getting metood, no chance of returning to the plantation"
2039,anything besides hardcore female hate will get you banned sooner or later.
2040,I agree
2041,"Ohhh I think I know why I got banned from reading mgtow vs mgtow2 topic. There was a thread some mgtow made and he posted a sexbot and said he would rather fuck that than a real woman. I was instantly wronged about it. I said something like:
""I dunno man... stuff like that creeps me out. Id rather fuck my hand watching porn or fuck a real woman (escort or maybe relationship but no marriage).""

I think thats healthy mindset and my preferance. Seems like those sweaty losers got triggered and banned me lmao."
2042,It is really incredible the vitriol being spouted there.  Failing to adhere strictly to their holier than thou philosophies will lead to you being called every name imaginable.

2068,"I hate that term and it makes me cringe every time I hear it...
then I saw some guy that totally fit it when I was out the other day and was like ""oh...""

I mean I still think its lame but I kind of got it a bit."
2069,"yea same 

it's a reason why i unsubbed, and on reddit i mentioned before how there is genuine misogyny and bitterness though there is good pointers in MGTOW."
2070,"That'll get you a ban for sure.  I can definitely tell which guys on there have actually been with women and which ones haven't, I'd call them out on it too.  But I'm banned, meh."
2071,The silver lining is that they are helping to create a fantastic community here.
2072,"that subreddit has definetely been taken over by people trying to paint MGTOW as toxic, it will be banned soon"
2073,"You forgot to mention the part where you went insane and went as far to make threats about finding/having someone's IP and becoming ""good friends.""

Didn't I warn you to calm down and stop making a fool of yourself? 

I thought strong men moved on and didn't cry like little bitches?

Third crying post about it? You really need to move on."
2074,"hahaha that can't be real, logistically it sounds absurd."
2075,"Incels are fuckshit. Your thread got upvoted plenty though. I agree with you inches are disturbed, and I quote you,  

&#x200B;

""if you are a misogynist because of how much toxic females you met then you have a point ""

&#x200B;

Yeah that would be me. Incels can be randomly right at times, but I really that community is shit and I hate all words not in vocabulary, like ""incel"""
2076,"I remember your posts there DrivZone, I was up voting you for them and I support your opinion.

I just got banned for posting in the same place. I'm not sure for what, but I'm guessing it was my post where I stated ""I see no good reason for hating women"" (in the sense that it's a waste of time/energy). Probably seen as white knighting/virtue signalling or some bullshit."
2077,"Yep, it’s literally the only thing. Every post is about how women are useless and fucking scums of this earth. It’s a shit show. "
2078,"I don't go there anymore.

It is a blessing."
2079,"Yeah they didnt say anything to me either and Im waiting for a response when I messaged them back.
"
2080,"I have been with them for four years when the subscription was ~16,000, why? No idea."
2081,Maybe they are on a bad day. Those mods are going nuts.
2082,They really are the worst of the worst.
2083,"Just giving some confirmation to the sentiment here. Look at my comments, apparently that's what it takes to get banned now (no reason given). Absolutely ludicrous, apparently that's how they plan to implement this concept of ""everyone go their own way""..."
2084,Cognitive dissonance: don't think one can be mgtow and be married. Pretty sure that puts you into MRA territory. I mean the whole premise of mgtow is men not getting married and exposing themselves to the inherent liabilities of it all.
2085,"Yea I was on the .com website for a while, it's all but fucked now.  I'm banned from the original sub as well"
2086,"You had probably been shadow banned before you were banned. I can't see some of your comments in the comment section, but I can see them on your profile."
2087,"Those cunts use a lot of shady tricks, they were fucking with me for weeks before i finally got outright banned. That fag /u/ss_camaro literally bans people if they're getting too many points, because he gets jealous. Also they didn't like me using the term ""roast beef whore."" They must, themselves, be sons of roast beef whores."
2088,This.
2089,"Something I've been afraid of for the last year or so is MGTOW becoming an echo chamber. There was a time when the sub wasn't so vitriolic. We would share ideas, and hobbies and give advice. I've been a member there since 2014 (this in an alt account). I remember those days."
2090,"I'm too the point I think they ban for pretty much any post that gets reported.  So if you cause anyone butthurt and they report you, you get banned."
2091,Literally worse than incels
2092,"It occurs to me that both females and males, of all the flavours of pills, make these sorts of judgements based on their favourite celebrity of the moment.

To me it seams strange basing such a broad opinion on an extremely small evidence base of rich people.

Surely it would be easier to accept that normal people age in different ways, it's mostly dependent on lifestyle choice. Or am I missing something? While genes do play a role I'd argue that money /epigenetics is a far stronger contribution to change.

Perhaps I've had one to many beers?"
2093,"I agree. Even if there is some things to criticize about modern day women. It does no good at all to spend so much energy and time hating on them.  The idea of mgtow was clearly to focus on self development. and alot of them completely miss that.  

And god for bid you bring up the idea of talking about other things and not women.  Theyll call you names and just defend them selves"
2094,"All their rules are bullshit and custom-made to be able to ban anyone for any reason or no reason at all. It appears to me though that they especially hate the MGTOW who are out of the red pill rage. No serious discussions allowed, methinks. But hey, I haven't been there for half a year since I got banned and not going back because that sub is as good as gone..."
2095,I did the same thing. They really didn't like that.
2096,[deleted]
2097,Mad preacher lad by any chance?
2098,"In all fairness, it's easy to spread. Just drop redpills on your friends and family. And feminism redpills more men every day as they expand the welfare state and make the laws against men worse (TFM mentioned a woman who got away with stabbing a man, and another who got only 15 months in prison for being complicit in a man's death).

Conversely, having kids just makes one more future feminist. Because odds are good you lose the kid to a feminist wench, or the public school indoctrinates your kid, or college indoctrinates him. Kids are fine, as long as you adopt and homeschool him. Otherwise, he's probably fucked no matter how redpill you are"
2099,"That's easy. Just apply mgtow philosophy to yourself when other men see you succeeding in life while they are struggling, theyll ask, and you tell them how. 

It's easy as that. Men know when something isnt working, but they do need to be able to see a logical, clear path out. And that is what mgtow is."
2100,"Yep, It will be interesting to see what happens to that sub over time."
2101,"Seems like a common pattern here. It's probably what happens when you go against what a mod thinks when he's in a bad day despite not having broken any rule. 

Which is kind of weird because you don't even have to defend women for this to happen; sometimes he's just triggered by what you were saying and seems to havethe self-control of a child."
2102,WTF
2103,"What??? You were one of the few insightful guys there.

I better be prepared to be banned, since I have been openly vocal about how I don't like that sub getting ridden by incels."
2104,that doesn't make sense considering all the unique profile names that are on there
2105,Username (and subsequent projection) checks out.
2106,"Same, at one point, almost made me feel like I wasn’t Mgtow. But then I realized that it’s moderators who are assholes. Mgtow is a great train of thought, but we look no better than feminists. Sometimes I feel like they want women dead just like feminists want men dead. It’s toxic, I feel that not all women are bad, but marriage and relationships never worked to begin with. It’s society hoping for something to be true when it’s not in human nature."
2107,"Man, I'll tell ya. Reading that shit makes me so fucking glad I've given up on relationships.

> I hate myself, I hate this, I hate how complicated relationships are.

I agree with you when you say both genders are susceptible to having relationship doubts. Those incels only want to see it one way. All women are cancer etc..."
2108,"Lol, it was that same post that spiraled me to a ban. I just can't shut up when something is clearly fake or wrong, but people keep using it to confirm a narrative. It's exactly the same that the worst SJWs are known for. It's a shame they're not holding it to a higher standard in there. It's becoming increasingly toxic."
2109,"It really is a shame, that sub used to be awesome. I learned a lot from that place and felt like sharing my own stories might help younger guys gain some insight, but I got banned for agreeing with someone that said MGTOW1 had started to seem sexist. I added that I think it's because a lot of incels have come here, and got immediately banned. I had been active on there for like 1.5 years and never had any problems. There's a special place in internet hell for all these bitch ass corrupt mods and admins."
2110,"Ok, nevermind, I'm officially banned now. I have just received a PM."
2111,"It's not illegal to tip off the authorities their info just saying

I'd say that about any mod. Fuck all mods. All moderators are gang stalkers and get a high off harassing people"
2112,Pretty much what I got banner for. IG related post saying men are bad on it too.
2113,Why am I not surprised at all to that nonsense on mgtow. Has nothing to do with  mgtow at all.
2114,"I'll leave it up because:
1. If that's what you did to get banned from the mgtow sub, then that's what you did.
2. Please do not repeat that sort of behavior here.this is not a sub to engage in inflammatory commentary on
 Thank you."
2115,"That just makes you a bad, hateful person"
2116,"It used to be about literally checking out and gong your own way. Now, with over 100k subs, it’s become some sort of mutated top trumps, women are pure scum zone that is so full of negativity and anger, it doesn’t help anything.

If you want to kill something, make it popular."
2117,"Welcome to mgtow. The 2 is incidental...

It's not a movement, it's a sub where we try and foster active conversation amongst men who are going there own way. 

The mods spend a *slight* bit of time trying to curate it constantly so it stays focused on the positive. 

For the bad stuff if it gets through, that report button and the good old downvote button used properly is a big help. 

Enjoy it here and hope to read your good contributions."
2118,A lot of it is just human nature. The negatives of it get lumped in as descriptors of the groups of people we don't like. It's incredibly polarizing.
2119,"Yeah. Those guys are getting unstable with every passing day. There was a post for people to talk about their difficult childhoods on that sub. Guess what? Those motherfuckers had to come and ruin that. A particular asshat called me my father's bitch cuz my father treated me like shit and said I'd go back kissing his ass when I need him.

What a toxic shitshow of a sub. I just replied to the bastard and reported his comments. There are too many assholes who hide behind their devices and talk shit on the sub.

I'm thinking of unsubbing from that crapwaste."
2120,Whoever the mods are have some power issues.  I hope they're not cops in real life.....
2121,Thank you for being respectful of the sub rules. And Welcome to mgtow (the 2 is incidental).
2122,I don't even know why exactly I got banned but I know the comment had the word in incel in it(I know I wasn't name-calling because I wanted discussion not discourse) like an hour later..... BANNED!!
2123,[deleted]
2124,I can make one and offered to do it for u/Supernumiphone.
2125,"True. Except the ""mods"" on MGTOW1 are worse than feminists manginas, IMHO."
2126,"Women are inferior in some ways, particularly physically."
2127,"I get it why they discuss women. Keyword being discuss. 
You have talk about what women do and their behaviors and how it affected you. It's good, its healthy. And it helps other men who may be stuck in similar situations find their way out of it. 

But what they do over there now is just bash bash bash women all the time but they dont offer solutions, advice, or success stories. "
2128,"I got banned for pointing out they are the flipside of the SJW coin.  They were bitching about Captain Marvel being to SJW because of female lead...

The time before that banned for pointing out they hate Game of Thrones because it has a few strong female characters.

It's hilarious how they bitch about the stereotype and then work so damned hard to live down to it."
2129,When you become actual meninists 
2130,"Just like you opened yourself to be hurt by that man... us men do the same thing with women. We just do it for different reasons. 

But like in any sub reddit you’ll likely get banned if your going against the sentiment within that bubble of thought.

I agree platonic relationships are important, but they are hard to sustain. Friends I have that are girls disappear when they get into relationships 9/10 times and I hate when they breakup and want to be my friend again. But yes I enjoy female friends."
2131,"Next time try pm’ing some user you see posting, MGTOW isn’t women friendly because it is men going their own way, not everyone going there own way. But if you’d like to pm me and ask about it feel free, I’m an avid humanitarian and a huge fan of almost all of what MGTOW stands for."
2132,"You wanna know why you were banned? It's because it's blatantly obvious that you didn't read [anything from](https://archive.fo/wCyUm) [the sidebar](https://archive.is/xPOqz) or the rules of the subreddit and instead chose to be yet another one of our run-of-the-mill trolls who does exactly what we expected: start drama and conflict masquerading as a ""debate"", and when called out, proceed to shame, project, and gaslight. You weren't ""genuinely"" trying to understand us. At all. No one bought your BS. And of course you're here portraying yourself as the victim of the banning that you yourself have initiated. It's almost like clockwork.

And you wonder why we pledged to stay away from your gender as far as possible."
2133,"Originally MGTOW was more of a safe haven for men who have given up on women/traditional relationships. We dedicate the remainder of our lives to self satisfaction. I have no problems getting girls/laid/relationships, I'm just no longer intrested. 

Now the Incels (those who simply cannot get laid for the life of them) start claiming to be MGTOW, and spewing toxic female hate comments, have really ruined the face of the community. 

MGTOW2 is very humble and less interested in bashing women. I am open to discuss female nature, tactics, AWALT, but I don't hate them for being what they are. Its about us, not them. 

I was banned for my comments in MGTOW and really dont care. This sub is the true face of rhw community, and represents what it stands for. "
2134,"globalist coq, u mean.  too many globalist libertarians stinkin up mgtow.  mgtow is politically diverse, as long as you're a globalist libertarian."
2135,Mgtow is normal. Its self-preservation. That's how its grown like it has. Lots of guys just doing what they need to survive.
2136,"your history and mine are pretty much the same.   Was on r/mgtow from around 20K users to around 100K.   When they banned me (the second time) I pretty much knew why.  Didn't ask why, just sent them a ""thank you"" note.   Needed the clean break from too much toxic negative shit."
2137,Follow your own example and leave out the angry politics please. Thank you.
2138,"If you claim to be MGTOW and are voting democrat, that may be the most blatant case of voting against your own interests ever.  Considering it’s the Democrats who keep passing all these laws that shit on men and ALWAYS support women over men, facts be damned.

EDIT:  The Republicans, may not go out of their way to help men, but at least the aren’t actively hostile to us."
2139,"I'm not mgtow, but I just find it strange how so many people on a sub that's all about going your own way and not focusing on relationships spend their entire time hating women and calling them names and focusing on their hate instead of bettering themselves."
2140,What did you expect? Men’s rights is run by a bunch of whiny man children
2141,"Honestly that's one thing I never seen.  Well, there was maybe the occasional idiot, but they'd get down voted for it."
2142,"While I don't agree that capitalism is a major problem, I do wonder if you have any solutions you can put forwards? Humans always have masters, and I'm always curious for new solutions."
2143,What for? And man whoever the mods are there are sensitive.  They never even explained to me why I was banned.
2144,Go through the top posts of MGTOW its all sexist “all women are the same” garbage that you would expect to hear from braincels
2145,I think I got banned for telling someone they might be gay. I was only half-joking. They really hate LGBTQXYZ
2146,/rolls eyes...yeah...OK.
2147,Louis Walsh directly contradicts that meme.
2148,[deleted]
2149,"Not with what they post, it should be rrr/Misogyny"
2150,"Stumbled, yeah a lot of people stumble in there , call them out for their obvious women hating even when they are making shit up and then get banned immediately "
2151,You were criticizing Vilar's work or a female on the post ?
2152,"Thank you for this. I was really interested in MGTOW at first, until I spent some time on the sub Reddit and saw by far mostly posts that focused on hating women. Hating women makes them just as bad as the extreme feminists that hate men. The existence of one justifies the other, and perpetuates it.

I thought it was great to see posts showing a member enjoying their life and doing something fun, until they make additional effort just to hate on women within the same post. And of course they ban anyone that criticizes or calls out their bullshit."
2153,"We do not ban users lightly. Obvious and repeated trolling, calls for violence, spam, and bots, yeah that'll catch a ban.  

I spend a lot of time removing posts that dont meet sidebar rules (please everyone read and follow them), and sometimes it's a judgement call on my part. 

But using bans as a downvote button? No."
2154,MGTOW is just a bunch of angry incels now though
2155,did you remove that post? i searched your post history and i couldn't find it.
2156,Same with me.
2157,"You were probably banned for being racist, based upon your posting history, sir."
2158,"to be honest, as a former mgtow user (got banned of course) I'm still a little misogynistic. not in the way you think, i don't want to cleanse the earth from women, no. but take a look at my posts history to see how many bad women are out there. 
i just can't look at women the same way i used to look before becoming red pilled.
it's just not worth the risk for me."
2159,"In all fairness, it may have descended into a shitshow, but it was always a men only place"
2160,"none, they really do hate women. I got banned for writing 18f for context prior to a comment it was relevant toward...."

2163,"The article cites rant.com as a negative example and if MGTOW1 consisted exclusively of raging Incels I woould agree. 

However, the occasional angry post amongst red pill knowledge posts and men's rights issues, seasoned with links to some amazing MGTOW channels is far from that. 

If we take huMAN as an example, he is calm most of the time so the rare anger-jerks undermined with cusses are really impactful and memorable. "
2164,"*Some* MGTOW1 submissions fulfill all each and every negative stereotype associated with men going their own way.

2173,"I didnt expect it from them. Twoxchromosomes yes, but not mgtow 1. Too bad, in gonna miss the memes"
2174,"All women are not gold diggers per se (my wife for instance) but almost 100% of them will not marry down except maybe for Super Chad.... even though my wife is 3 times richer than me and I am somehow Chad.

So I think we can still say that 100% of women are somehow gold diggers, with rare explainable exceptions (looks, status)."
2175,"This is what happened. The OG MGTOW was really just an incel sub disguised as MGTOW, once the competing incel subs got banned they dropped the act and absorbed the refugees."

2181,"I didn't see any when I scrolled and admittedly wasn't trying to stay longer than necessary. I saw one post talking about single moms congratulating themselves for being mom and dad. I'm 50/50 on the single mom hate in MGTOW because I was raised by one. And it's not like she kept me from my father, he literally didn't want to be around me. It's a long story but, my father is legitmately a *bad* person. Admittedly, actually. Like...*criminal* bad. Even HIS father (my grandfather) is ashamed of him. So, I don't hop on that ""let's hate on single moms"" train too often. It's all case by case."

Oh, crap. I just had a hilarious, yet horrific, and likely inaccurate, thought. What if all of the mods weren't only women but *feminazis* who only created the sub to lure men to it and encourage them to post misogynistic BS so they can use a 3rd party program to extract user IPs, and are creating a secret database of ""the enemy"" to doxx them and bring them to ruination? Honestly, a lot of the things posted there would cause those men to get fired if their employers saw it. That would explain why they ban people who make sense. They *want* people to be as depraved as possible so when they finally out them, it will do significant damage. 





I have an overactive imagination. Ignore me."
2190,"That's a good question.  It's where I got my start with MGTOW, but it does seem frustrating that they ban people with no explanation.  You would think someone who gets banned at least deserves to know why."
2191,"And in other news, this account got banned also. 

I wash my hands of that sub. Incels have been embraced there."
2192,[deleted]
2193,I hate it when they call themselves “mgtow”.  
2194,"Exactly, being MGTOW shouldn't be outright woman hating, because clearly, that's no better than the misandry that they accuse 3rd wave feminism of doing. It just steers close to ""the other"" mentality where were placing human beings into ""good"" vs. ""bad"" territory, and it's just not how the world works.

&#x200B;

I'm going my own way, because me, personally, I've had nothing but toxic relationships.  But I'm man enough to admit that I'm partly complicit in that arrangement.  It's more that I view modern dating to be especially dysfunctional and that, at least to me, is the real fight.

It's a complex world out there, yet a lot of finger pointing."
2195,Says the stalker...
2196,"I appreciate your support vodka, hope this sub is better for us from the negativity and hate in that sub.

they started to ban everyone who don't agree with them on the hate so it make sense that you got banned for pointing that out."
2197,"Eh, me too I think! I have an hard time understanding what the problem was with a lot of posts in this thread for the triggered mod. It sometimes felt like anything but licking an incel's toes was bad (and I wasn't even into random hate them at all)

2201,This might explain why I would make posts and then they disappeared off the board and I had to repost them.
2202,Was not that bad last year but now it is exactly as you said: focusing on the negative.
2203,"Yeah, I'm starting to believe the MGTOW sub has either been hijacked or hacked. Very bizarre! There are way too many emotional shit posts about bashing women, which is fine but the problem is there are way too few posts building up men. I got banned after posting a topic about ""what negative habits will MGTOW men stop doing"". I don't think it's a coincidence. "
2204,"I didnt believe you guys about the mods trying to stifle discussions, but it really seems like the mods are actively trimming anyone thats not in ""redpill rage"" phase. Yeah, expect to be weeded out. Oh well, I was gonna set up shop here sooner or later anyways. "
2205,"The funny thing is, I don't mind some more aggressive attitudes. I was shadow banned or my comments were put into a filtering process for no reason at all.

The thing is, some of my comments do get through, but only a couple of hours or even days later, at which point noone cares anymore. That ruins my social experience of the sub."
2206,Well a howdy doo and hearty welcome to you too.
2207,They probably are.
2208,"I’ve thought I had seen groups who called themselves that

Nonetheless, why do all the incels in the mgtow sub support trump? He’d probably despise them in real life"
2209,I think it might be important if people want to keep the movement alive. Plus need to find a way to verify so no trolls and fake outsiders can join

Over the time period I was at MGTOW1  I could see the mods becoming less tolerant and more willing to use the ban hammer.     Was this because of the fast growth of the subreddit, now over 100K?

MGTOW is married to the idea that you'll be happier without solipsistic women in it. But you become self-serving solipsistic yourself. You also become utterly miserable without fulfilling your biological imperative. It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons. 

Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men. So what's the difference? Because all I see is men like this too. Especially MGTOW men who aren't interested in building community. I spent a year trying to build a community around MGTOW with users and they were never interested. All they want to do is moan about women all day. 

MGTOW doesn't make you happy. Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving. Society as an whole has become too big. Where as men and women would thrive in smaller communities. There are too many issues just to blame it all on women. And as society increases so does its lack of empathy and the feeling you are just a number. So better to build small communities.

I do not agree with that and feminism is actually damaging woman on the long road. Just as men are *better* in natural fields, woman have insticts and operate on levels unimaginable for men. Man can be Simping for years and could not see it but woman will notice the shit much more quickly. You can lie a woman for a year but to a man awhole life. They have *antennas* or special instincts (mother instincts) that cannot be accessed by pure logic and intellect.

The fact that it's a community based subreddit that states to its members that it's nothing to do with community goes to show you that it is utterly self-serving. How is that any different than any woman or man you meet today in society?

MGTOW just plays into the narcissistic division segregationist society. It literally says, ""Okay society, you win! Now let me get my fill"" and instead becomes exactly what nihilist society wants in a MGTOW's own image. 

How did I draw that conclusion? That chase of career. The chase for material. Elliot Hulse said it better that ""I'm with you MGTOW but you focus too much on the matter. The mother world. The material.""

And I believe he is right to some extent. There's no harm in bettering your career but if that's all you do and all you aspire it material, what is your legacy? 

>Being self-serving doesn't mean I'm harming anyone else in the process

Not at all but its essentially why societies collapse. It's a communist-like mindset. And as the population grows into self-serving narcissism so does the utter disdain and divide amongst people. 

>MGTOW has made me happier than I've ever been, so I don't know what you mean by that. 

It's all about how it makes you feel. Which is the issue with this society. It's always self-entitled. Self-centered thinking about its own self. It doesn't want to better the lives of those around them. It is one degree away from feminism.

>Learning to not depend on anyone but myself for happiness is the biggest step I've taken in my entire life. The fact that there are shitty people from both genders has nothing to do with why MGTOW is still relevant.

MGTOW is relevant in a nihilist society. I've come to the conclusion its a way of coping and becoming just like modern women. Which only serves to divide and segregate everyone. 

But you never see MGTOWs want to get together and build a community. All you get is, ""MGTOW is about your own path"" And being surrounded by self-serving entitled men just reminds me of a male version of feminism. 

What beyond the basics of don't get married and be careful does MGTOW provide? There's no pearls of wisdom beyond a few YouTubers. Majority of golden posts are from The Red Pill and books that don't follow the self-serving approach.

And MGTOW can't even do what they set out to do anyway. They focus too much on negative female experience. They talk about women all day on MGTOW1 and how much monsters they are. They give women their power away by making them the boogeyman/woman.

Atleast The Red Pill aspires for community. Atleast it brings men into its fold and looks after them within their small community. MGTOW does nothing but worship the self. And that's how we got here in the first place.

So you can say MGTOW has helped you. Perhaps it has. But I didn't come here to serve myself. I came here for brotherhood because without it any community inevitably collapses. Just like the PUA community did.  Stronger together, divided we fall. And it will always be this way. A community without guidance is going nowhere. 
"
2270,"One thing that is an important consideration when you are talking about the principle of ""AWALT"" (all women are like that). It is pointless to bring up ""NAWALT"" (not all women are like that), because unless someone is genuinely disturbed in the head, they will know that out of the 4 billion women on the earth, it is not even statistically possible that every single one will be an ""awalt"" type. 

The whole reason that AWALT is even a saying is because there is enough of a risk in dating, relationships, and marriage today that AWALT is a reminder of a real danger you face as a man. 

If I were given a 50 gallon drum of apples, and only 10 of them were poisonous, but the only way to tell the poisonous ones from the good ones is after I take a bite, I wouldn't be worried about what my odds are of ""finding a good apple"". I'd slap a big warning label ""DANGER: POISONOUS APPLES, DO NOT EAT"" on the side, and leave the whole thing out by the dumpster for trash pickup. 

That's what AWALT is. It's a warning that engaging in an activity has many detriments, and few benefits. It's not a scientific statement. 

Many guys get stuck in being angry after being on the receiving end of a ""poisonous apple"" when it comes to women. And so they choose to walk away from that in the future. Some stay angry, which is what I am hoping to help get them out of by having a sub like this where they can talk with other mgtow men about how they can move on successfully. The other mgtow sub is for staying stuck in the anger side of things. 

What women do mgtow men want? well, depends. When it comes to marriage and cohabitation, the answer is none. For myself, I extend that to girlfriends, dating, and any non-professional relationship. Though some mgtow men are open to that."
2271,"Its not so much that there are a few ""good women"". I think looking at people through the lens of good and bad are too simplistic. People as a general rule are selfish and self serving. Obviously it is to a degree that doesnt jeopardize other things they want. Also, people tend to delude themselves into thinking that they arent ""wrong or bad"" when they want to justify doing something that is pretty abhorrent. Im more concerned about the society around us that holds women to many double standards or the fact that theres sometimes no recourse for a man and nobody seems to give a shit.  You take the shaky moral relativistic nature of women and their selfish attitude and combine it with the male hating legal system and you get men opting out because it is the reasonable thing to do."

This is an out right lie. Having a woman does not make a man happy. If you are a miserable man when you have a woman you will just be a miserable man with pussy.

>It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons.

It does matter that not all women are evil as you say. There are plenty of evil women to go around and all it takes is one to destroy a man's life.

>Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men

This is the men and women are equal lie. Why? Because lets say you have 2 children, the one every time he does something wrong you punish and the other child you allow to do what ever he wants. Who do you think is going to be well behaved the child that was getting punished every time he did something wrong or the child that you did not punish when he did something wrong? It's obvious that it's going to be the child that was getting punished when he did something wrong. In our case men are being punished and women are being allow to go unpunished or get a slap on the wrist. Just look at
all the women that have falsely accused men of rape for example. When was the last time you heard of a man falsely accusing a woman of rape? There is no way men and women are going to act the same when women have the state backing them and men just have
themselves backing them. Also men and women are different so they are not going act the same. Men were the protectors and providers because men think others. Just look what happens when there is a catastrophe. It's men that jump into rescue others at a risk to their own lives.

>All they want to do is moan about women all day.

What this guy is effectively saying is if you're going way why do you talk about women so much. The reason men need to talk about female nature is because we are trying to help other young men not to fall into the traps women and society are trying to get young men to fall into.

>Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving.

Obviously men are going to start becoming self-serving. What did you expect men to be generous when women are so selfish? So men should just continue to give and give and give while women continue to abuse men?

>Society as an whole has become too big

Yeah maybe 2 years, it's also possible, depending on lawyer quality and mitigating circumstances you'll get some long probation equivalent or house arrest.  Assuming they have that there.

A lot of it will be based (obviously) on any previous criminal behavior or if she was home a the time."

2359,"I agree, others have mentioned that as well, but I just weirdly like the flavor profile.

If I'm making this more mexican style, I don't even use beans or corn or that other nonsense."
2360,"Very easy, its not at all complicated.  And I didn't put a single cheffy skill on it, although you could, because I had already spent 6 hours simmering beans.

* Can of pinto beans

* Can of Kidney beans

* Can of sweet corn kernels

* half or full lb. ground beef.  I went with half.

* trinity ( which is a mix of celery/greenpepper/onions ) or you could just use an onion.  Trinity is a Louisiana thing.

* Chili peppers, I went with two green jalapeños and two red chilies.

* Can of diced tomatoes.

* chicken stock

So first I put the trinity and beef together in the pot, with a knob of butter and let that brown up for awhile, add some garlic, let that do its thing for a bit, then start throwing the cans in.

Beans, then corn, let that sort of combine, and do the tomatoes last.  After all that I add the diced of peppers, seeds and all to give it a little spice.

After this has sort of done its thing for awhile, I add enough chicken stock to over everything, this is gong to reduce for awhile so I make sure it's all covered, also I don't know how ""wet"" I want it to be as there tends to be a lot of absorption.

Seasoning is whatever flavor mix of chili powder, cumin, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and some more garlic if warranted.  I have no specific spice blend, i just sort of make it up as I go and flavor adjust.  NO salt as all the canned crap has too much anyway.

So if everything seems fine I bring to a boil then a very low simmer and ignore it for an hour, then after it's reduced the liquid a bit I'll ladle it into a bowl, top with shredded cheese, and squirt sour cream on.

The sour cream helps with the chilis, the corn sweetness helps balance the tomatoes acidity, and the butter adds a smoothness dimension to the rendered beef fat.  top with some green onions and I'm all good.

You could eat eat with fritos, but I don't particularly do that."
2361,I’m a purist I guess. Meat and chili’s. That’s it. Maybe some onion. Maybe.
2362,"I agree, others have mentioned that as well, but I just weirdly like the flavor profile.

If I'm making this more mexican style, I don't even use beans or corn or that other nonsense.  Just the meat and chilis."

2374,"""Western"" feminism is just feminism now.

With America's steady rise in popularity in terms of entertainment and politics over the decades, people all over the world have been increasingly made more ""western"", which translates into taking in all the bad points of being an american.

Even in countries like mine which couldn't be further from US, both geographically, and socially, you can see the cancer of western feminism creeping in and breaking society from the inside.

It's difficult to think where feminism is going right now, but for me, feminism as a movement became redundant by the year 2000. Hey, atleast you don't have to worry about fake allegations right?"
2375,"I've said it before and I think Jordan Peterson has too.   The only way this problem with Western women will get solved at this point is if SANE women start countering the wackiness of the 3rd wave feminism being spawned.  Because you posting here is preaching to the choir.  Some women are standing up, like  Bettina Arndt,  Karen Straughan  and others.  

As you may have discovered in the colleges, this is where the 3rd wave feminism has spawned.  They indoctrinate the women, who many become teachers, and indoctrinate children."

Thanks for posting your point of view, always nice to hear it is not just us ""MGTOWS"" that have these types of thoughts.   I think modern society breeds mental illnesses and social media just throws fuel on the fire, the more I examine modern life the more I feel like it impacts all of us in a negative way at one point or another, man, woman, straight , gay, whatever alphabet letters one likes modern society will shit on you at some point.

2410,"I had heard of Jordan Peterson, but didn't know of the women on your list. Thanks for mentioning them. I'll look them up."
2411,"The problem is that the extreme majority of women who are anti-feminists still want all the power and privileges feminism has brought them.  They are against feminism for victimizing men (and for being crazy), but just as strongly against removing things that give them advantages and power.  Such as legal preference in child custody and alimony and the stupidly easy divorce laws, etc.  And when I say ""legal preference"" I mean that the woman is by default the legal provider to the child and so there are actually men out there who pay their ex-wife child support even though the men in question have custody of the child.

Basically, most women who are anti-feminism are pro-girl power.  Which is feminism just without being openly anti-male.  Feminism = anti-male to get power, girl power = pro female to get power.  The power and privileges and dominance they want is the same, they just try to get it by being nice instead of by being hostile."

2413,"Dude, a co-worker of mine at a previous job did 30 hours a week as an engineer and technically worked less than 30 because she had a secondary, albeit bullshit role (was not hired for) and she was being paid full-time.

2414,"It'll probably catch up with them during their performance evals, but that's an year out."
2415,"Hmm, my observation hasn't quite been that. I'm friends with two gay men who've shared their very deep misgivings about the metoo movement, and the ""liberal"" left in general. One of them is a libertarian voting white man, while the other is a Republican voting latino man. One of the my other trans friends is openly pro-Trump, who she sees as the only person who's crazy enough to stand up to the ""liberal"" left (her words, not mine).

On the larger screen there are groups like Gays for Trump who are definitely not aligned with #metoo folks.

As all of you know, there's a personal and professional cost to not being on board with these liberal movements. Especially if you're living in a large, ""liberal"" city, it can be very isolating for LGBT people to be vocal about their beliefs about these catchy-named movements which lack any substance. Not making any justifications though  


Though overall -- I do agree with you. Most of the LGBT people around me have bought the idea that they're ""oppressed"" because all of their ridiculous demands aren't met."
2416,"Genuine question - how do you think I could've stopped getting the award? 

I shared here because I wanted to get it off my chest and fwiw, this seemed like the only place a post like this would be tolerated (even with a throwaway account). Do you think I was treated more positively because I was a woman? If yes, how could I have stopped that?"
2417,"Skepticism is very healthy, especially of things online.

I mentioned elsewhere that I do believe I got and still get special treatment. I despise that, but most of the time it's out of my hands. Those who know me will vouch for the fact that I don't seek it out.

I do think I can be metooed falsely. False allegations of this kind are usually made by people who are mentally unbalanced, and there is no scarcity of psychological issues in the lesbian community. I've had one very close encounter with something like that. I'd share it, but I feel I've shared too much identifying information already, and I don't want to get doxxed.

I'd probably get 50/50 custody ... unless my ex could spin my lack of support for feminism into something evil. I don't know, and I don't want to find out.

Our experiences are definitely different. But that doesn't mean that I can't see absolute abuse of the social and judicial systems at the hands of these women. I have seen more things than I've written here. It's not just about me receiving shit at the hands of women."
2418,There was a Swedish lesbian TV personality who got caught up in meeto. I think anything is fair game to the psychos.
2419,"I have to make sure that I'm not being put in leadership positions just because I'm a woman. I've actually been offered to lead teams in areas I'm not comfortable in, and it's a bit of a pickle trying to figure out how to weasel myself out of it without ruffling feathers or causing drama. If I say that I don't think I'm capable enough for the role, people seem to want to ""encourage"" me (because women need encouragement?) 

Luckily, the team I'm with right now, I'm fully certain that I'm a right fit for them, and they for me (at least till six months ago, when they hired the other two women). I know I'd be miserable if I were in a position I wasn't qualified or capable of being in, and I'd fight that tooth and nail. I take pride in my work, and I derive a lot of my self esteem from doing a good job at whatever I do -- I'd hate it to be taken away from me.

This is precisely why I'm against how programs advocating more diversity in tech fields are structured. It just makes everyone miserable.

Having said that, I'm sure I have received opportunities because I was a woman. The prominent one that comes to mind is that I funded my graduate studies partially off a women-only scholarship. I'm not sure how I feel about that. On one hand, I feel that if someone wants to pay money to a certain group of people, they should be allowed to do that. On the other hand, it sucked very bad to see my male peers go through financial difficulties I didn't have to go through, for the most part (though all of us, men and women, were broke, to various degrees, in grad school)"

2483,[deleted]
2484,hahaahah.. I really like that one.
2485,"Forget about MGTOW or anything of that sort for a moment. A person like that you never want to be friends with because they bring no value or enrichment to your life and are only a drag and a burden. Ditch them regardless of gender, age, etc. Friendship is supposed to be a 2-way street where you both bring some kind of value to each other. And I mean real value not sexual favors because then the person is a whore. Always watch out for people wanting stuff and taking advantage of you, while offering nothing in return. Men do it too."
2486,"You don't owe her or anyone else anything or any apologies. Live your life! Forget about her.

Be excellent! Be amazing, achieve amazing things.... I guarantee she will find you later in life and you will laugh At yourself for ever being remotely interested in her..."
2487,"I don't know why you thought that this post would get you banned. It is the reason mgtow2 exists in the first place.

&#x200B;

Know your own worth, and treat women like other men out there. 😁"
2488,"Listen dude we can all see this for what it is, you out your own self worth above those who neither value you nor themselves. Good on you for that. 

You have ambition and don't want anything to get in your way, good for you there too. 

You want to help somebody who clearly needs it, that's just the part of you that society says is essential for your survival and you've seen through it, again good for you. 

Keep going your own way and keep placing your own self worth and the highest currency you have."
2489,"You did good. At a certain point you realize you don’t want to enable someone’s ongoing pattern of dysfunction. Your value is increased also with asserting yourself especially your self value. When you are assertive, people respect you more. It’s not your job to fix someone else’s life, God knows it’s hard enough just living our own. Keep up the good work!"
2490,"Ask yourself if she'd give you a ride if you needed it.

Just assume that she has a car.

Would she go out of her way to give you a ride?"
2491,"Even as a platonic guy friend, he'd just be a drag on your life.  Good choice."
2492,"I doubt the mods will delete this post for bashing women?  It does not even begin to do that.

I think you have made the correct decision to remove her from your life.  She sounds like a self obsessed toxic person."
2493,"Yah don't go out of your way for something without positive ROI.

SOP for personal progression. Everything you allow into your life must positively impact your baseline, be it immediate gain or managed long term risk."
2494,You would be surprised how holding your ground and telling women NO works wonders! They’re so use to being pampered their entire lives.  Never place a women on a pedestal.
2495,Good for you bro. Especially at your young age. Most women think once they put out the guy will do anything for them. And it's true from most simps.
2496,"The way I would approach this would be to treat her as a friend rather than a woman if that makes sense. Would you be prepared to pick up and drive a male buddy to work? 

The answer is yes if you enjoy your time together and its a laugh.

If not, then don't do it.

It sounds to me like your in a friend zone rather than the boyfriend zone and the easy way to test this is to excitedly tell her that you have a date and see how she reacts.

Alternatively, you can just say fuck it and ghost her.

Your call."
2497,"Without meaning to offend you, the reason she probably checked out of your friendship/relationship is when you said you wished her the best success etc women hate that shit. You've got to remember that they interpret things differently. They truly want a man to take charge and lead them. By nature they're submissive and by wishing her luck etc you make her the leader. Its batshit crazy but this is (partly) how women work. There's no such thing as a strong independent woman, they've coined that phrase to make them feel like they're good at stuff. Trust me, you're better without her and her using you for a car share."
2498,"Thumbs up 👍 for seeing things clearly!
What sucks is that she can’t see what she’s doing to herself or else she could have fixed the mess she got herself into. I’m glad you’re doing better now btw."
2499,"You definitely are not bashing women at all.   


Don't let ANYONE use you, unless it's quid-pro-quo. I've had male friends pull this crap and I tell them they better buy a bike or learn how to fix their car.   
No good deed goes unpunished. Usually the ""nice way"" of handling this is to make up an excuse. If the person persists - they are the ones being rude, not you. People in general can have a strong sense of entitlement.   


Being an attractive/cute woman, they can get people to do things for them. Good for her, but it's of no benefit to you. False accusations are real, and have even happened to Uber drivers out there who had it all filmed luckily.   


... Back in my day, it was Cash, Grass, or Ass....not a good idea at all now..."
2500,"I'm 59 and I've seen women like this for my whole life.  
You can only do so much to help or motivate them but you should know that sometimes no matter how much you do, some of them will only go through their while life being complete leeches on others.
  Do yourself a problem and GET AWAY from a person like this.

They will suck your motivation and life energy right out of you."
2501,"You should have said ""Yes"" in place of ""No"" and provided the local Uber phone number instead. In short, be more helpful the next time around, OK?"
2502,"Good story about standing up for yourself and going your own way.

You learned to recognize a user and cut them out of your life, even if it was tough.

She's not your problem, and most likely all she did is move down to the next guy orbiting her.

You got free!"
2503,"Ik it's cliche, but that saying ""don't cross oceans for someone who wouldn't cross a puddle for you"" comes to mind. I'm glad you realized this sooner than later. She would've  only held you back from achieving your goals."
2504,"""No"" is one of the most useful words I know. Not only in response to women, but in life in general."

2508,"Bravo. Great post. I don't usually read the entirety of posts but yours was very succinct and I got value from reading it. Maybe I should visit this sub more often, it kinda got crazy after the main sub got quarantined. Who knows, maybe I'll resub instead of just popping in every once in a while.

2511,Thought we weren't allowed to talk about women on this sub? It should only be posts about men fishing and doing boring stuff lol.
2512,What is real value?
2513,"A valid point, the last person who did this to me was another dude. Sat next to each other all semester, talked shop, and then he would always ask for a ride way out of my way, like 30-40 minutes extra, never even invited me in once or to hang outside of school. I did it twice before I realized this guy was only acting like a buddy to get rides, once I stopped being available he ignored me from then on and moved on to his next victim.

Tbh I never made a single friend first two years of college despite being very outgoing and talking with dozens of people. Everyone I met just ended up using me for something, males and females."
2514,[removed]
2515,"I assumed people here would see the meaning of this post, I just didn’t want the mods to take this as “He’s bashing women and hating women. Removed”.

Totally not the point here, obviously. I’m lucky to have plenty of female friends, but this one in particular decided to keep using me and I had enough."
2516,[removed]
2517,"Last time I said I couldn’t give her a ride, she asked if I could Venmo her $5 so she could get an Uber. I’m just being used for favors. I’m not looking to help her out anymore."
2518,Or she can act like an adult and do it herself?
2519,"Why is the onus on OP to ""be more helpful the next time around""? He paints the picture of  the other person taking advantage, or at the least, taking OP for granted. At this stage he has neither responsibility nor encumbrance to offer help. The healthiest thing for OP to do is to disengage full stop."
2520,"It’s such a messy situation. She has tons of friends, male and female. If she needs a ride, she gets a ride from a friend eventually. I know plenty of guys who are orbiting her, yeah, and I guess I did too because I just wanted to help her get out of the poor situation she was in. I realized she’s making no consistent effort to help herself, so there’s no point in scrapping my knees to get her off the bottom level."
2521,"I didn’t even care about the sex, I just wanted to keep her as a friend. She clearly has lost interest in sustaining a healthy way of life, and doesn’t seem to value me appropriately."

2527,"I say this to you generically, because a lot of codependent men show up in MGTOW. It is a curse on your well being and you waste all your time, money, and effort trying to make friends, family, or love interests happy and you forget yourself.
Find out if you're codependent. Fix that, and life will be easy. You can say no from the start. I was co-d for  45 years without knowing it, because I wasnt a simp. I just never did anything for ME, and thought letting others do things for me was a hassle for them. 

You take away the joy others get by denying help or gifts, and likewise you steal peoples independence and decision making by doing everything for them.

NO MORE MR NICE GUY by Dr Glover is a fantastic book. Women are not always the problem, and being codependent, a ""nice guy"", or a simp makes everything worse for you and everyone in your life."

2566,"It's this form of currency that you can use to spend on shit.

My mom used to do it to me. She'd give me points for doing good things like getting good grades, helping her around the house, helping dad with his office work etc.

And then I could use these to buy myself things, like a new toy helicopter, or a bike or a game boy or something.

But the difference is, I was fucking 5 years old and this is a grown ass man, who I presume makes his own money. 

It made sense when my mom did it to 5 year old me, and I'm thankful she did that, she and dad taught me about managing responsibility and the value of hard work among other things.

I'm 19 now and my mom and dad don't do it anymore, since they know that the system has outlived its usefulness

But this is a grown adult, and even I can recognise that theres something really wrong about this whole issue"
2567,"\^This. I remember someone making a similar point, with the following example:

If a man said to his friends ""I'd like to go, but I better not, my wife wouldn't like it!"", his friends would probably laugh, and understand.

If a woman said to her friends ""I'd like to go, but I better not, my husband wouldn't like it!"", her friends would be concerned and ask ""Is everything okay at home? Are you being bullied?"""

I think about him everyday. He was with me through it all. Heartbreak, depression, loss of friends, and all the good times too.

2597,"It's the same way women expect us to embrace their sluttiness ""dont slut shame me"" but they literally not only do it to men who are lucky enough to be playboys, but they also do it to other women. They really want to be the only ones who can slut shame, the only ones who have the freedom to go their own way.

The same way a woman is applauded for saying ""I want to have a kid and I DONT NEED a man to help raise it. I'm a proud single mother"" and women cheer her on, but how would they respond if they guy first said, ""You know, you wanted this baby more than me, and you're a strong, smart woman, why dont you raise the baby yourself?"""
2598,"It's called only wanting the benefits or cherry picking, but not taking the responsibility.

The only reason it's gotten the way it has is because men let it. Probably more than half of the guys on MGTOW2 are the same @$$hats that cry about it. They're the ones that whine the loudest. The same ones that women will dump because she's moving up the ladder. Then these guys go into hate mode, telling all guys to hate women and cry about they're going MGTOW for life.

Then a little later down the road the cycle repeats. They hook up with another woman, and their right back into being a beta simpcuck, crying about how wonderful she is and all men should worship her.

2599,"Aye, even my dad who knows nothing about MGTOW and who was an old-school womanizer type in his prime understands that I don't really want to intimately associate with women because of the current social and political climate.

2602,"> This is why feminism and women as a whole have such an issue with MGTOW... Women tend to hate MGTOW because it teaches men to put himself first...

A nitpick with how you phrased this: I think most women have no idea that MGTOW exists. 

Women and **men** discount MGTOW when they initially hear about it because it goes against the current narrative: men should get married, or at least pursue women, so that they can be happy(!) 

I think the kick-back against MGTOW is through a genuine desire to help men achieve happiness(!) by getting married. 'Won't you be lonely', etc. Painting it as though women hate MGTOW because it teaches men to put himself first is too broad a brush. Certainly some women might see it that way, but for the majority of women who hear about MGTOW: their criticisms of MGTOW are similar to men's criticisms."
2603,"Yes, women are more dangerous because they are cognitively optimised to navigate social situations. I pretty much view feminist women as ruthless psychopaths and am more wary of them than any man I see."

I think if more users in MGTOW-1 crafted their posts like this, it wouldn't right away turn off a lot of people.

2607,"Things have to change. I recall when this stuff was at its peak. When MGTOW wasn't a thing and women were truly in that goldie lox zone. 

That wasn't long ago. And for the most part, it's business as usual in this feminist society, but the cracks are present. 

What I predict will happen is either society will self correct completely, making gender distinction once again fashionable and even marketable. A push back mechanism against this gender neutrality. This could make this whole gender war just a cringe phase in our history. There's still room for ""Something in between"" in this. 

Another possibility is the eventual elimination of traditional roles or behavior models attached to sex. This is the ultimate end game of this feminist agenda. 

Either is a solid possibility. Humans are a highly programmable species. Our sense of morality and normality changes over time, and if things continue as they are now, it's inevitable."

Why? Why get upset over a goddamn movie. So you don't get to watch it tonight. She hasn't worked since the early.90's and was whining earlier today about how I borrowed money from my dad to go to grad school, which I've already started paying back. My dad is still working, he's 75 years old but he still works so he can provide a plush retirement for her non-working ass. I'm so fed up with her.

Ultimately our logic and reason tends to crumble when tingles take over and drive us to be able to have some thrill.  This applies to both sexes, though women as the emotionally driven sex are definitely more apt towards this behavior.  Also many people knowingly behave in a hypocritical manner as a way to advance socially. Not everyone has morals and behaves in an ethical manner. Think middle management types and office personnel.  It's nothing to get angry at.. acknowledge it as a weakness of the species and you'll be one step closer to being able to break free of the cultural matrix."

Many years ago, I decided that I was going to stay single and have done so. I can think of more than one woman who has given me a bad time about liking being single. As I got older, it dyed down and people pretty much accept that I'm going to be single for life. If women don't need me, I'll leave them alone and just go do my own thing and be happy."

Mgtow stop giving, or lessen at least, that attention.

&#x200B;

So many men these days are over-feminized, flaky little rats. They won't stand up for shit, won't stay true to their words, and will abandon all their own morals in an instant to get what they want.

-
Ayup... I have noted that many, **many** times within my comments in /r/MGTOW.
-
Even came up with a term for them: they're not so much MGTOW as they are the **""Ex""-**Men -- as in **""Ex""**-husbands (the ones who were married & got divorce-raped) and **""Ex""**-boyfriends (the ones who were just cohabiting or in some other ""LTR"" short of the official-legal paperwork) -- and generally speaking they're just going through their *""I'm DONE with women! [And THIS time I really mean it!!]""* phase.

-
I've also noted that -- per both statistics on divorced guys, and my anecdotal observations of men in general -- THAT stage typically lasts anywhere from a month to about a year or so (maybe a bit longer if it was a ""brutal"" breakup or devastating divorce-rape) -- before they start ""testing the waters"" (flirting, eyeing up women to at least potentially ""date"" or ""hookup"" with, logging onto {or back onto} Tinder, etc)...

-
And then, in about 2/3 of the cases, within 5 years they're ""remarried"" again (in scare quotes because they MIGHT just ""cohabit"" instead, avoiding the official-legal paperwork, as if that will save their arse)... with **most** of the remaining 1/3 just taking a bit longer (possibly having one or more ""aborted midstream"" attempts at relationships that fell short of an actual LTR/cohabit/marriage).

-
Overall, I'd bet that LESS than 1/10 (~10%) of them **actually** manage to live the rest of their lives as *true* ""MGTOW"" -- they're just TOO habituated to either the sex and/or the ""in a relationship"" identity, etc -- and too ILL-equipped to actually ""go it alone."""
2628,">even my dad who knows nothing about MGTOW

Yeah my Pops told me on the phone the other day, while talking to me about my younger brother with 5 kids and a ex-wife/2 baby momma ex-GF's milking him for child support and giving him a bunch of drama that would drive any man insane. 

""You can do anything you want. Blow a whole paycheck if you feel like it, because you're free. But you're brother is stuck. Them women control his ass now."""
2629,"> Aye, even my dad who knows nothing about MGTOW

He may not know the term, but he's apparently ""getting the message"" regardless."
2630,"I view most women this way. 

Here's an experiment. 

Try to have female friends where the quality of the friendship is on par with your guy friends. Suspend any sexual desires, and just try to have a friendship. 

It's when you start holding women accountable to the same standard as men. When your expectations of their behavior are the same as men, that's when you'll start seeing the core problems. 

Most of them are psychotic. Most can barely keep an actual conversation. Most cannot escape their nature and cannot fathom you in any other context outside that of utility. Regardless of your best efforts to befriend a female with any hope of forming a normal friendship. Disappointingly you'll end up just being that nice shoulder to cry on. 

You'll quickly fall into the stereotypical bullshit where you sit around listening to her relationship woes. Until she's vented enough, has a paradigm shift and now has no need for the dynamic of the relationship she pushed. So she will drop you. 

Sorry to say this, but we only ended up in this shitstorm thanks to feminism. In our school days, we had it right. Most of us weren't friends with girls. We had a saying ""Chicks are for banging"". 

I'm 42 now, and yeah I even have a few female friends. They're all ""normal"" by female standards, but when you get closer they're flakey, self-absorbed and frankly a bit insane."
2631,"> I pretty much view feminist women as ruthless psychopaths

Yup. Sociopaths, too."
2632,"See this is what I hope for. But I feel like the powers that be have thought about this which is why they are inundating society with rapid fire delusion: feminism, the trans cause, gender identity in children, which is somehow related to racism, etc etc. This is why I can't even pay attention anymore because there is so much filler that the original truth is getting buried. Like just to debate that there are gender differences I have to disarm the previous points; which these points aren't even freaking real. It is exhausting...and a waste of time. We know next year will be even more ""topics"" created to slow the rational minds down."

Prison guards failed to give proper medical care. And this man was connected to a high profile musical artist, and they still did him dirty. What's worse, he was arrested for...wait for it, failure to pay child support. All of [this](https://youtu.be/U50gOUGQzLk) was for failure to pay child support. Also, women get lighter sentences for committing the same crimes as men than their male counterparts. This is a statistical fact. Sit all the way down. -_-

Disgarding the doctrine that all men have to wear the yoke of being responsible for others, disregarding his well being in the process."
2640,"Yeah, I have to agree with you.

And then the irony of it is that the ""new"" one they eventually pick -- choose or fall for or end up with depending on how you look at it/label it -- is often (and we're talking *blatantly/obviously*) ***cut from the same EXACT cloth*** as the one they just divorced/got divorce-raped by/were alternating between crying & raging & grieving over just a year or so prior when they were in their reactionary (faux-MGTOW) ""I'm DUN with women!"" stage/phase.

-
We're talking almost IDENTICAL... as in even down to their NAMES\*...
-
So they divorce and/or get divorced by *Louisa* (that bitch, can you believe she cheated with the NEIGHBOR, expected to be forgiven and for hubby to still be NICE to that neighbor?)... but then FF a couple of years and who do they hookup with and marry but a 2x divorcee (with kids and thus one or more of her ""ex/baby-daddy"" guys nearby), and she is named... wait-for-it... *Luisa!*  

-
WTF? That's like trading off an old used Chevy because, well *""it got dented up in an accident""* and you just CAN'T STAND the idea of driving a dented up car (etc) -- but then going out and buying **another** old used Chevy, except one that's even MORE dented up because it's been in *multiple* accidents (and from the looks of it possibly even driven in a ""demolition derby"").

-
Moreover, while there usually ARE some -- relatively superficial -- differences (i.e. the first wife was a blonde, the second a brunette, etc) when it comes to voice & speaking pattern, inflections/accent, even general overall behavior & ""character"" of the person... DESPITE the insistence of the guy that ""this one is DIFFERENT from the other one""; the resemblance is sort of ""uncanny""

-
A half dozen guys that I know PERSONALLY (as in been friends either with them or with their families for decades) have followed that EXACT same pattern\*\*... it's to the point that I figure one can PREDICT (with something like at least, *if not better than,* 50% accuracy) both when and who (name/character) they WILL ""partner up with"" again in fairly short order.

-
**But to get back to YOUR point...**
-
Yes I'd say you're correct in that it is somewhere *around* if not ***more than half*** of the guys on various MGTOW forums (/r/MGTOW and /r/MGTOW2 especially) who follow that pattern.

---

And then, as you said at the end of your prior comment:

>>On the other had you have guys like me that aren't mad, we just don't give a sh!t.

EXACTLY.
-
Unfortunately... because MGTOW forums are virtually the LAST ""male space"" that allows such bitching *(sort of the same as why the guy being cheated on/divorced ends up calling his [never-married] BACHELOR buddy at 2AM*\*\*\**)* -- we end up getting painted with the brush of THEIR ""blue pill raging."" (And while **WE** calmly, coldly, objectively {and yes often a bit harshly/brutally} talk about the REALITY of female nature {and MALE nature as well, though that is often overlooked/forgotten}; **THEY** {recently or 'in the midst of' divorce/d guys) come in, repeat & exaggerate the points about WIMMIN... in an angry ""red pill"" RAGING-story fashion, bitch about their wives/gf's {especially the ""cheating"" etc}... and so the accusations of ""misogyny"" {which then have some validity}.)

-
Just like the ""incels"" -- the not only NEVER been married, NEVER ""fucked""; but *most often NEVER dated, kissed, or been even the least bit 'intimate' with a female in real life* -- who plop in, MISunderstand what MGTOW is about (often only imbibing and regurgitating the superficial ""meme-pic"" garbage), and thus contribute to the mischaracterization of the whole enterprise.

-
**The TEMPTATION** is to BLAME them... but of course the fault really lies with US (the true/actual/real ""MGTOW"" -- that is time-tested/proven as such); in that **we take PITY on these ""pathetic"" creatures** and let them into our ""clubhouse.""

-

---
\* Which I often have to wonder whether it isn't ""on purpose"" as a sort of safety/insurance -- I mean so long as the name SOUNDS the same, then if in some moment of passion (or memory error) they say their EX's name, well no one will be the wiser -- but regardless, it's rather WEIRD/TELLING that the guy who WAS married to ""Louisa"" ends up marrying a ""Luisa""; or likewise with other name-combos; the guy who divorced ""Cathy"" then marries a ""Katherine"" [Kathy], or yet again from Sarah to Sara, Susan/Suzzane[Susie/Suzie], Mari/Mary & even Marianne/Mary-Anne, Ginny/Jennifer[Jenny], Kristina/Christiana [Kris/Chris & even Krissy/Chrissie etc] and so on...

-
\*\* And there are other elements too: basically the DEPTH/HEIGHT of the ""RAGE"" and/or depression/crying that ensues... is a predictor, **not** of them *truly* becoming or following MGTOW, but rather the opposite; the MORE they rage (or cry, complain, etc -- same thing really) the MORE likely they are to ""return to the plantation"" for round #2 (and #3, etc).

-
\*\*\* Mainly because -- well not only do WE actually ""understand"" the situation (we've seen/heard it dozens if not hundreds of times before) -- but we're the only ones that will (or even practically CAN) actually TAKE their calls... especially at that hour of the day/night.  They DARE not call their other ""married"" buddies (assuming they even have such), lest they create further problems."
2646,"Yup, you can see this with Jordan Peterson, and I'm not even a fan of him, but just watch how his logical points are completely disregarded. 

""That's nice you just showed evidence that there are gender differences, what about racism, and the fact that Donald trump is president and had an affair, why do you hate trans people?""

Over the last year I definitely see tiredness and bleakness wash over him. To me this reinforced my idea of ""shut up and do."" The time for talking is over. You want to help men? Mentor them, guide them, help them network and get jobs. No need to talk to anyone, that is what females do...sit around and gossip to get another being to do the heavy lifting. Men just DO...period but this is getting lost."

2648,"> There was a statistic that said that female prisoners were more violent and more prone to violence in prison.

Big chunk of that is likely because -- with the possible exception of say Martha Stewart -- in order to be SENT to prison most women tend to *have* to have done some ***really egregiously*** ""fucked up"" shit... often have a long sordid history of priors as well."

That ""Usually"" there at the beginning tells me you have an inherent **prejudice** in this regard... one that you are NOT being honest about."
2650,"The enabling aspect in all of this is that many people alive today are just living off the technological advancements of others. They do not have the intelligence to actively participate in this. They have no real social obligations either. 

They walk around with a very limited understanding of things because they're so arrogant they assume anything outside of their sphere applies through their projective nature. 

They also have far too much time on their hands and get deeply caught up in first world problems. 

Now a subset of these due to their vindictive nature and misguided compasses are just in it to stir social unrest. Some even might believe they're doing good, but without the intelligence and foresight, they cannot fathom the deeper implications of their agendas and they have no empathy to begin with anyways. 

They're a product of ""Princess syndrome"". They believe they're special, better than everyone else and always correct. 

So how do you reason with these people? Worse is that all considering, vast changes here can occur within even one generation.

2651,"I specifically said ""in my experience"" for that exact reason. You may have a valid argument if I implied this was a fact in all cases. However, I made it very clear that my statement was based upon pure anecdotal evidence. Why are you so determined to be combative over such a non-issue, anyway? In my observations, that, indeed, is usually the case. That's strictly *my* reality. If you've observed and/or personally experienced differently, that is strictly *your* reality. It doesn't make either of us entirely right or wrong, nor does it suggest that the scenario described in the OP is purely a fabrication that never happens. I was offering a different perspective on the point in the discussion which is based on a false premise; that all single mothers are proud to be single mothers and shamelessly flaunt such a status. 

There are multiple causes of single motherhood where praising said mothers for raising their children alone is appropriate. The example I listed  in my original post is common in my community. Right below that is the father being murdered. Right below that is the father being imprisoned. All of these examples were caused by either the fathers themselves or third parties. The single mothers who manage to raise their kids alone when faced with these situations deserve to be encouraged for it.

On the flip side, single fathers get special attention as well because they go against a negative stereotype that fathers turn deadbeat when they separate from the mothers of their children. They also receive well-deserved praise if they raise their children due to the mother being an addict, imprisoned, or dead. There are many variables to these situations, and frankly, I find it crass and myopic to paint all single mothers with a broad brush because of this."
2652,"Yup, I concur completely and have arrived at the same conclusions after conscious deliberation. Good news is that I truly do believe now is an awesome time to be a man and to help sharpen the few who have decided to desire something better.

Exciting times we live in. I truly do believe the next 10 years will be pivotal in cementing the fate of the west if not the world.

I'm thinking every time some OP who isnt an obvious alt account or troll breaks the rules, I lock the post, and then give OP 24 hours to post something about how mgtow is helping their life.

I'm serious... this is NOT a carbon copy or refugee camp for men who want to lay claim to being ""mgtow"" and just spending their time bitching and complaining about women. 

THINK about what mgtow is doing for you to make YOU better. Then post that. You can talk about where YOU used to be when you were blue pulled, and you can relate that to where you are now that you are a mgtow.

I would say guys do it to but they are either assholes or being sarcastic and will let you know right away. But even the assholes are rather rare in doing this because they know such behavior could lead to an asswhupping or at least people not wanting to hang around them.

Some single women seem to think they are above society's niceness as though they were a celebrity. They see nothing wrong shit testing their host despite the obvious rudeness of it all.

However there is another reason for it as well. They think being a bitch makes them more attractive because they have been picked up by guys who were jerks to them. It's a reversal of expectations. Girls are used to guys being nice to them so they take it for granted. When a decent looking guy comes along and doesn't kiss her ass, she thinks he must be on a higher tier therefore she finds him more attractive than the nice guys. 

Guys are more used to women being bitches to them or at least cold and indifferent. Guys are just likely to be put out by a bitchy woman either getting angry or losing their self esteem. The guys not phased by it are the usual pump&dumpers whom the girls later will claim they are tired of due to all the ghosting."

2701,">What a lot of women don't realize is that shit tests are only relevant if the guy is actually interested in them. Otherwise they just come off as being assholes, like in your experience. Many of them, especially the attractive ones, simply can't fathom that a guy may not be interested, they're so narcissistic and solipsist it doesn't even cross their mind.

This is extremely true. I don't come from a background of having been screwed over, my marriage never had time to go bad. So i never developed the personal distaste. Thus, i don't avoid women at all except the part of being alone with one.   


But i do see that the more attractive ones are the ones that can't in the least understand why they're not wrapping me around their finger.   


To be honest, If i would say that I have a ""type"" these days.. even though i don't engage.. It would be the plain janes. They are usually much more relaxed about things. And they can often spend a whole evening being just pleasant company. Something a hot woman can't do nearly as often. They tend to get obnoxious or downright hostile when they start feeling the bite of failure."
2702,"i’m kind of confused about what a shit test is. my ex wife used to demand i let her go to clubs and hang out with guys etc. is that a shit test? or how about, if i was in an argument or confrontation with a stranger, she would butt in on the stranger’s side if they were guys. is that a shit test? or how about, she would always make snide/snarky remarks, disagree just to disagree, make disparaging comments daily. is that also a shit test? and what response are these women looking to in these shit tests? my ex never acted this way before we got married. only afterwards did the ugliness start (literally on day 1). i didn’t give into her bullshit and she eventually took off and filed for divorce. what are they trying to accomplish? find a man who’s the perfect chump who will tolerate their shittiness for a crumb of pussy?"
2703,"F, for solipsism."
2704,Thank you!
2705,">d and accomplish big things for yo

Best of luck to you. I really have no good advice for your situation, i'm sure that there are others that can do better. What I do know is that you need to make sure that the finances gets in order. Nothing, and i mean nothing will allow you to be a better father than not having to constantly stress over that.  That breathing room has been my saving grace in so many ways i cannot begin to tell you."
2706,I am curious about your story here.
2707,"The boy's mother is dead. Not only did you miss that important fact, but now we must assume you are critical of his story, since she is 'non-existent'. So, what's the criticism?"
2708,"> My wife passed, and I was left with my son who is 6 now, (he was 3 then)  

Literally the second line in the OP."
2709,"No, shit test is when they try to figure out how you deal with being dissed by them by for example talking your fries or insulting you in a more or less obvious way.
They don't want a push over but they might settle. Just know that a woman who views you as weak will resent you. 

What your woman did was just shitting on you, sorry. 

There are videos about shit test on YouTube and I think The Rational Man (book) explains it too."
2710,"The last part made my day a little lighter. Thanks. I'd also like to try to answer your question. As a young man who has seen some shit, I'd say the females get a taste of power every time they do that. It strokes the ego and eats the soul- I did not intend to get philosophical with this. They want to feel like they've made a guy their little chump, to manipulate.
I'd say its quite fashionable for the female to have a little pussy-begger-slave behind her as I see this sort of behavior quite frequently. In my opinion, it gets her respect and jealousy from the others in the female collective or ""hivemind"". This phenomena seems to be quite ubiquitous these days, given the emasculating soy boy producing society we live in."
2711,"Thanks! And yeah getting financially stable will be my #1 priority. Will be tough and my family is out of state as are my friends. So basically I'm hitting the reset button on my life which I think i need. So definitely not going to be in the dating scene and MGTOW helped me in that regard. I'd like the company of a lady every now and then but right now I just have to focus on me and my child and no one else. When the time comes I'll be more financially secure, in better shape and will have options. And will never remarry. Life will be good it just will be a tough road but I'm looking forward to it!"
2712,"I made a couple posts you can read. A lot of it is on me. I was in a dark place for awhile and didn't know it really. Caused chaos (affair with a co-worker, how cliche) But I've been in therapy, stopped drinking and have been doing the best I have ever been physically and mentally. And despite my username an excellent father as well haha. We've been talking divorce because despite doing well I just haven't had the ""passion"" she craves. Kinda hard to be passionate when she won't even touch me.  But I do speak her love language which is gift giving and words of affirmation. It just hasn't been doing anything. I told her maybe talking divorce would ignore that spark in me to want that from happening. How could I fear losing her and divorce if we didn't go through with it? And it did. Started researching and man...fuck I just don't want to do it lol. I know id be settling and that's a bitch thing to do but I just want to be absolutely sure for the sake of our child.

Well come to find out she's been cheating on me. Just found out last week actually. I don't know all the nittty gritty details and honestly I just don't care or need to know..I know all I need to know which is to get the fuck out while I can. 2 wrongs don't make a right and we both have contributed to making a shitty situation

So yeah...I just have zero fucks to give right now. We're going through with divorce and keeping it amicable. We're going mediation route, no lawyers. We make the same amount and want to split everything evenly which I'm cool with.

I'm just a bit scared in how I'll survive on just my income. Family is a state away. Ill be ok just may have to do some side gigs or get a 2nd job and figure out if renting an apartment or owning a condo/townhome would be best for me. A lot to think over.

But red pill philosophy has helped me so much. I've learned a lot about myself, my wife and life in general. I'm a MUCH better person than I used to be and will continue to be so for the sake of my daughter who is my world now"
2713,"having dealt with one who literally left me for not putting up with bs, i was under the impression that a push over is what these cunts want. but oh well. i think anyone who feels the need to test someone is a piece of crap and not worth any effort."
2714,"Boundary pushing is also a shit test, though less obvious. This is how men end up saying "" I have to check if it's okay with my wife""."
2715,this is what i was thinking. i disagree with the prevailing attitude that almost all of them want a guy they see as strong. i think what they are looking for is that docile and thirsty chump who will worship them no matter what they do.
2716,"Here's some things that helped me early on.   


Set up a home, make it your way and start living in it like YOU want to. But, my one big advice is this. Keep it clean. There is nothing that can bring your spirits down like a messy home, and once it gets really messy, the task of cleaning it seems bigger and bigger. It took a long time before I managed to pull myself together and start doing this right. But it made a huge difference in how i felt about myself. As well as being able to open the front door and not be embarrassed. I was in a long slump and my house was a total mess.   


Don't live to impress, get only the home you need. There's only 5 people in the world that actually care about your home, the rest are either ok with whatever you have or jealous. And you don't need jealousy in your life.   


Wealth protection before generation. Pay off your debts, even if it sucks. Don't start to try and invest etc until you have your debt situation well under control. ESPECIALLY high interest debt. a 19% credit card is a much better investment to pay off than the stock market. And once you start owning things that other people have payments on, you'll see how much money that actually is. I couldn't believe how much money I was able to save once I had no more payments. Even though I understood it theoretically, the feeling once you see the numbers start adding up in your accounts is pretty powerful.   


And above all else. One day at a time, nothing happens immediately."
2717,You're getting full / majority custody?
2718,"They can't help it. It's in their DNA to test potential partners, they are not bad people. Just be aware.
In your case, she probably saw you as a provider of some sort. They have different rules for this and the ones they really want. 
Maybe you are soft or you got played by her or yourself. Learn, accept, adapt! (sounded like a self help book there :))"
2719,"Well this is how the story goes these days man. I woke up at 17 after dating a crazy young woman, tested the waters of a relationship again at 18. Conclusion: weird world we are living in."
2720,"This is all amazing advice thanks! Especially keeping my place clean. Our house as it is is a nightmare half the time and constantly smells. My STBXW just doesn't clean. At all. So most of the cleaning duties fall on me so I'm already used to it but it will be much easier solo. 

Fortunately I'm debt free. Unbeknownst to me my wife wracked up quite a bit of debt over the past few years. I might have some responsibility with that which sucks but you're right I will get whatever comes my way cleaned up first. I don't know much about investing anyways I do have a 401k going which is good tho"
2721,50/50 which we are both cool with. She needs her mom and dad and we don't want anything less. As shitty as it is to say the week off will be nice to recharge (and make money hopefully) We've been doing it for a bit actually in just handling responsibility and it's honestly made me a better dad. I go hard on the love and attention and focus when I know she relies on me and no one else. I like it. And like that Louis CK bit at the end of the week I can take a bath in vodka and my own filth lol. I can be a killer dad half the time
2722,[deleted]
2723,"Not sure about the facts in your case, but yeah, depending on your state and WHEN she racked up that debt, you're probably going to owe half of it. 

Seen that happen too many times."
2724,Ah okay. When I hear 'single parent' i tend to think of the parent having majority / full custody.
2725,">They have different rules for this and the ones they really want.

He's implying that you were not the one she really wanted. It's not a diss, he's merely implying she may have thought you fell under the beta bucks category (aka, the one she wants to settle for) and you not accepting her bs put an end to that. You did the right thing."
2726,"I see your in the States, not sure about your laws but in Canada you are not responsible for your wife or live-in’s debt unless you specifically signed for joint responsibility. Luckily I was just reading this yesterday at a consumer proposal site. So if you didn’t sign specifically your in the clear, at least in Canada."
2727,Ah yeah that makes sense. Wrong phrasing lol. Divorce isn't actually too common in my circle I guess. Divorced dad I guess I should say.
2728,i’m referring to his “maybe you are soft and got played” comment. nothing i posted earlier even implies that. thats a passive-aggressive sneak diss from out of nowhere. you gotta be a real bitch and a loser trying to build self esteem to act that way.
2729,"Your vernacular is cool with me, pretty sure most people use it the way you do, not the way I do. NGL week on and week off does sound like a nice lifestyle. Perhaps I'll find a lady one day who wants that kind of arrangement."
2730,"Rereading the entire thread, it may have been a diss indeed. Problem is that I can interpret  “maybe you are soft and got played” two ways. One being a diss and the other being a hint. Not putting up with BS is one, it's how you end the argument that either shows her whether you are ""strong"" or are feigning ""strong"". This is something women will pick up on rather easily, where you may not have. If he meant that, it's a hint. If not, a diss."
2731,"i see your point. if thats what he meant then i’ll apologize for my other comments, but it really looks more like some random sneaky insult. and the point of what i said earlier is that these sort of tests and other asshole behavior won’t get women very far with men unless they find one who is willing to put up with it. in my case most of it was unwarranted and i stood up for myself early on after noticing a pattern of totally unwarranted bs. thats when she took off. lol."
2732,"Such a great read hope you enjoy it, keep safe man"
2733,I quote this book when I'm arguing with my sister.
2734,"The only 2 book I read of Orwell.

Two master pieces. Start with Animal Farm. Maybe you would like to read Huxley after 1984.

Good choice."
2735,"I paid just over $7 for my copy off amazon last year. Haven’t read it yet. I’ve seen the movie, but don’t think I ever read the book. It’s definitely on my “to do” list."
2736,What are some other great books to read?
2737,"I really wish public schools didn’t force kids to read this. It’s a really good book, but everyone hates it because it’s associated with English class lol"
2738,Animal farm is a classic. I also highly recommend Fahrenheit 451 if you haven’t read it before.
2739,"I paid 20 dollars for my copy, and another 20 for a large plate of pork chops afterwards."
2740,"Great book, enjoy!"
2741,Great book
2742,I just saw the movie for the first time yesterday.   I'm sure the book will be much better!
2743,havent read that book in years. great buy!
2744,"Heh'  
I love me some social distancing. Been doing it off/on since 2012, by accident mostly.   
Exception being I go outside in nature to areas that have less human traffic.   


1984 is a great book, enjoy!"
2745,"Social distancing is such BS. Tell the sick and old people to stay home, don't interrupt the lives of the other 90% of the public."
2746,"I haven't read Animal Farm, but I loved 1984."
2747,Ah yes. Nice book. But that'll only cover one afternoon at best :D
2748,"For as long as I have known there was a “black list of banned books,” I have snatched up those I could find in bargain bookstores and yard sales. I have copies of Johnny Got His Gun, the KJV Bible (yes, it has occasionally been banned), Huckleberry Finn (for use of a certain word considered derogatory), and a few others. 

1984 should be in my stockpile."

2751,"Someone asked for books to read, The Gulag Archipelago is great, if you have time.
The audiobook (on youtube, dozens of parts), read by a British reader is easy to listen to and understands how to convey emotion and despair of the characters.

2752,"It's a great read. Depressing but great. 

Brave New World is also a great read."

2761,Fiction or Factual? There are many.
2762,Le Estranger by Camu. It’s a pretty quick read and very thought provoking.
2763,Will do.
2764,"Tell that to the people coming in contact with the infected and then going to every fucking store they can.

That's how I got sick and why I'm now under orders to self-quarantine."

2773,"If healthy people would refrain from visiting sick people, that would fix that issue. I certainly think they should not be allowed to visit sick people.

Also, the government is partly to blame. By gunning everyone up into a frenzy, they caused people to panic buy all sorts of shit they don't need. If the government had treated it like they do the flu (I.E. ignored it), this wouldn't have happened."
2774,Why should the government get to dictate to a private business when it can be open? Why should the entire public have to stay home for the flu when it presents no threat to most of them? Why not just make sick and old people stay home and let the rest of us conduct our business?

2780,"Because our hospitals are not equipped for a mass influx of people with such a virulent condition as covid-19. We don't have enough medical ventilators nor beds if we end up seeing the kind of increases that Italy, Iran or even China saw. The whole idea about this shutdown is to keep the numbers manageable so that if we do see more cases we can handle them. While keeping mortality rates down to a minimum, as current projections still have it around 3-5% for those under the age of 80 and 14% for those above the age of 80."
2781,I’d also argue that farenheit 451 is more applicable as well. Everyone focuses on the government surveillance in 1984 but never the self censorship and self submission found in Fahrenheit 451. I find that book to be far more prophetic with society’s current sensibilities
2782,"So? How long should society be shut down for? Because as soon as the shutdown ends, cases immediately start to skyrocket again. The virus is going to run its course, either now or after the quarantine ends. Why delay it?

Those projections are wrong, by the way. The death rate is under .5% for people under 70."
2783,"As a character building exercise, I almost wish every man spent a few years of his life without money, homeless, living from a car, etc.  And then rebuilding his life to something successful based on his own efforts.

My ""friends"" went off to college and universities and said  maybe they'd see me again if I ever pumped their gas at a gas station, or served their fries. I always had to work, always had to fight. 

As an adult I started to learn that most people are lazy and lack work ethic. I started to outshine those around me, just be being me.

I used to live in Fla, and also obtained my CCL. I am always armed except in federal and State buildings, and hospitals and financial institutions, where carrying is prohibited. 

If I may, I would recommend you shop and compare, and obtain one of those insurance policies that will cover your expenses in legal and civil cases if and when you might ever have to draw your weapon in self defense. My policy covers me either on my own property or out in the real world where it’s legal to carry. I have made use of it once in the three years I have had it. Nothing came of my situation, but the peace of mind knowing a local lawyer was informed of my situation and ready and willing to represent me was well worth the roughly $400 US it costs per year. My biggest worry was that I had to draw and fire my gun and wound up killing a dog. The whole thing worked on my mind until I got over the fact there really wasn’t any other option, other than a warning shot hot, and I had already vowed that if I had to shoot, it would be to make every bullet that left my barrel count, and I would bear the responsibility of every one that did. So I don’t fire warning shots.

It's still on my to-read list, but I have a feeling I might be aware of what you're hinting at. =]

> Let go and be free

Best feeling ever, dropping the hot coal, hand is free now. Now I can ""monkey branch"", too!"
2830,"Damn!  That is well written! So true as well.  People prey on those whose instincts are far more noble than their own.

  I started Atlas shrugged some years ago but got busy with work and had to return if before I finished.  I may have to give that one a second look."
2831,"Ayn Rand is hooey.  But getting involved romantically again with this woman would be a colossal error.

Resist, by finding other things to do."
2832,Well said!
2833,Who dis?
2834,Never reply back. Usually they just want attention.
2835,Tell her she can blow you for 5 bucks
2836,"Anytime you hear ""I can't"" from a woman , what she's really saying is, "" I don't want to"""
2837,"I think most MGTOW guys will get this in a crisis. My ex wife wanted to be chummy. She fucked another dude while we were married. Her sense of entitlement, to my resources, knows no bounds. Really pissed me off that she would think I’d have anything to do with her."
2838,">and that she can't find a job

Tell her to keep applying, and to hang in there lol"
2839,My Man
2840,"Responsibility and duty are reserved for family and close friends. As for pity, I have none for anyone."
2841,Keep that shit on read.  Shell get it eventually
2842,Block her.
2843,Figure out a way to sleep with her without giving her any money.
2844,"I would of told her "" Tough shit "" #Phuckthesehighmileagehoes"
2845,pump and dump
2846,Whats $MeToo?
2847,Yup. Women send out feelers like that .... Even married ones. Attention is their drug.
2848,"Lol you’re a sexist prick. Women are people too buddy, hopefully one day you’ll figure that out."
2849,Who indeed.
2850,Knew a guy named John gall way back when
2851,"""I have learned to walk away""

Your first step toward enlightenment. If the Government is giving them everything they are very low quality indeed. The sad part is even the wage earning versions are benefitting from government enforced preferential hiring. Wage gap my ass. The wage ""gap"" is between their legs."
2852,"Lol, it’s so obvious that it is sad."
2853,You set your iMessage setting to “send read receipt”
2854,You ever have one of those toxic relationships that was literally just crazy sex and drama?
2855,"It’s on audible, easy way to read it and get some work done at the same time. Listened to it twice read it once"
2856,Or wait until after 10pm to hit her up. Booty call hours
2857,False accusations of sexual misconduct of some nature in order to create grounds on which to sue/press charges for cash I would assume.
2858,An extortion racket.
2859,"Yes, they are. But have you noticed how its almost never men asking for money from their Ex's? 

&#x200B;

this is u/30203forever 's comment, that you should read, as it outlines clearly how this trend is more common among women:

&#x200B;

 Now, imagine she dumped you and you were hitting her up. How long till  she'd have threatened you with cops or had $MeTooed you right away? Or  blocked you? P.S. Keep her her messages just in case she decides to  $MeToo you in the future."
2860,"If women are people too why do they always treat us like trash? They hate and despise weak men -- that's not human. Like the guy said, it were the opposite she would block him instantly at minimum. Seems like subhuman behavior. You'll never figure that out."
2861,Are you suggesting that people are not manipulative or opportunistic?
2862,The guy who stopped the railroad.
2863,Oh yeah. 14 years ago. I still get anxiety thinking about her lol
2864,It's by far the best sex. Highly debatable if it's worth it though. When it goes bad they'll cut your heart out and hand it to you on a plate. With a smile.
2865,There’s two versions on audible and one is 10 hours longer which version did you listen to?
2866,">on which to sue/press charges for cash I would assume.

There's also plain old character assassination and self-denial over past (consensual) mistakes."
2867,"Daphne (IIRC) still got to fuck the alpha at the end. The irony of the entire book lies in how the go-getter female worked her hypergamy instincts to fuck the rogue Chad in her teens/20s, a steel magnate in her 30s and eventually the baddest of all Mr. Galt himself. 

Written by a woman so you can expect no branches to come short."
2868,"In hindsight I think she was part of the reason as to why I joined the navy. Run, run as fast as you can."
2869,"It's not. 

Source: was stalked by crazy ex for YEARS.  She followed me even when I made two  moves to different states.  She found out where I worked, where I lived, she stalked my parents home around the holidays, etc.   Whenever she'd get ahold of my phone number and fill my answering machine up with threats, pleading, crying,etc. 
Threats including paying gang bangers to torture me to death while she watched and threatening to break into my apartment, kill my dog and leave him baking in the oven for me to find when I got home. 

The police in three states gave absolutely no fucks whatsoever. 

No sex is worth that shit."
2870,I hadn’t realized there was two versions. There’s probably a subreddit that you could ask about it. However the version I listened to was around 50 hours
2871,Dagne. Don't forget the 'rogue chad' was married at the time she hunted him down.
2872,"Ha, ironically, I met mine when I was in the Corps. I broke up with her before I EAS’d. I thought moving out of Cali and back to Texas would rid me of her. Wrong. A month later I found out she moved to the next town over and was trying to get back with me. She was contacting my parents to get me to talk to her. After 3 years of this shit, she finally took a hint and moved back with her folks in Philly. I was pretty blue pill back then, but savvy enough to get rid of her when I had the chance, and smart enough to never let her know where I was staying or where I worked. I was lucky to not have any property destroyed by her."
2873,Cool thanks!
2874,"In the USAF we had  PCS, which stood for Permanent Change of Station, although when you got to within 30 days and a wake up, it meant Permanent Civilian Status. 

What is EAS? My dad was a Gyrene, er, I mean ‘Leatherneck.’ I’ve never heard the acronym you gave before."

2876,"I’m spending Christmas alone in a foreign country. I moved here with my girlfriend recently, spent most of my money on a car. She threw me out last week and so I’m stuck in Airbnb accomodation until I can sell my car and try and recoup Atleast some of the money from it. A very lonely and uncertain Christmas sadly. However a very Merry Christmas to you and anyone else reading this who is having a hard time. I’m trying to treat this as an experience that I can learn from."
2877,"I refuse to do Christmas anymore. Instead I buy myself things I have been wanting. I never liked trees in my house anyways, neither did my cat ;p. I appreciate the gesture though it does get lonely sometimes."
2878,"It’s been 9 months since my ex(lived together for 2 years) and I parted ways. I’ve come so far and I have learned so much about myself and I’m proud of what I have accomplished alone but man the holidays hit hard this year. Merry Christmas Men, here’s to becoming comfortable in our own presence and to continuing GYOW."
2879,Cheers! Merry Christmas to you too!!!
2880,"Merry xmas dude! No worries, one more experience in life, and pay attention to any red flags next time. Welcome to freedom ✊"
2881,"Have a happy christmas, folks!"
2882,If you learn from your mistakes there is nothing to worry about
2883,Thank you ! ! ! My family treats me like a black sheep so I choose to stay away.
2884,"Merry Christmas to you, and all solitary men. Particularly those like me who get grouchy the day after Halloween when merchants greedily start playing Christmas music. (Or so I hear they do.  Haven’t shopped in years, still grouchy.)

It will soon be over, and we can take a second to reset, and seize the new year by the throat and work to make our lives a shining example of success, achievement, fulfillment, prosperity, and continuing contentment, if only to those of us who know whom to look for, because we are the only ones that really matter. 

Onwards, men!"
2885,Merry Christmas
2886,"Merry Xmas, buddy!!"
2887,Merry Christmas fellas!
2888,Hell yeah! Happy holidays everyone!
2889,Merry Christmas
2890,Merry Christmas man.
2891,I can 100% relate to this! Well not the car part but the rest of it.
2892,Merry christmas Bro! I hope the best for you :) may your wishes come true
2893,Merry Christmas To You. Sorry to hear you are going through this. Best wishes
2894,"Curious to know more about what happened there. Nevertheless, you're in the right subreddit. Get charged, get your life back - dont wait for Xmas to be over."
2895,merry christmas partner.
2896,Thanks! You’re the only person to wish it me apart from my Mum so far! Haha. Merry Christmas to you also my fine dude.
2897,I haven’t got the money to go home until I sell my car. It’s such a shitty situation. However Atleast I have a roof over my head and a full belly so I am grateful for that. Many people don’t even have that at Christmas. I’m thinking of seeing if there’s anywhere I can volunteer tomorrow instead of spending it alone and wallowing. Either that or I might see what money I can spare and buy some food for the stray cats. There’s lots of them in Cyprus.
2898,Thankyou
2899,Thanks. Personally I find Christmas a grind but it’s nice to wish others :)
2900,"Good luck to you and do not step into relation-shit again because guess what, girl*friend* is an oxymoron! Happy xmas, man!"
2901,"Yeah I’ve never really enjoyed the ‘festive’ period but, good will to all men!"
2902,"Thanks bud. Never going to trust a woman this much again. Always going to be, from now on. The captain of my own ship. Never going to rely on a woman again. Happy Xmas to you too!"
2903,The only good thing about the festive period is the Boxing Day football the day after haha
2904,"Yep. If there was only one thing to remember about women (and the primate females in general: Thank you David Attenborough!) it's that they are biologically amoral. So we can expect no honesty, loyalty, integrity, word, honor or any other quality based on morality. Also, anything a female says, make a habit of mentally adding the word ""now"" to it and then, they'll start making sense."
2905,"Yes absolutely get a life before considering getting a girlfriend. The last thing you want to do is make your girlfriend your ""life"" It's a mistake many guys make (including myself back in the day) 

Just become familiar of female nature to protect youself. If you have a life before dating you have the freedom to ""not take no shit"" when it comes to her because if you leave her you will immediately have more time and money to do what you want to do."
2906,After being betrayed and divorced. Still losing so much financially to it every month. I don't think I care to find a woman ever again. Just look forward to the rare times when I can get my kids. Pretty much what I live for at this point.
2907,"That's really the way to do it. You hear that old cliche that you have to love yourself before you can love someone else. Life goes in a natural progression where important skills are built as you grow up and a lot of people get fucked up in childhood by not having good parents, a good father figure, or a good circle of friends, and that fucks up their personality, so they end up socially awkward, lacking the ability to hold an interesting conversation or make people laugh or in general small talk, and for men this really gives them a big disadvantage with women and life in general if they can't fix it.

Social-proofing is by far the most important skill to have in life. It's one of the essential skills that leads to a stepping stone to bigger things in life. A large majority of men have varying levels of beta in them but the ones who don't grow up socially well adjusted really end up being the ""creeps"" of society. There's also the matter of having no father figure and an overprotective, coddling mother... I've seen examples of what happens to kids with this situation, still living with grandma at age 40.. nice enough guys but never really pushed to be independent in any way. Women can get away with this because men are always chasing and ""saving"" them, but for men this will lead to a feeling of unfulfillment because men are biologically wired to want to achieve greatness."
2908,"Women? Bah! I’m chasing money fam.

When I tried out relationships after so much blue pilled peer pressure, all they have ever caused we’re a whole lot of distractions. Fuck that. Follow your heart and if women ain’t in it, fuck them as well."
2909,"Thinking that doesn't make you a MGTOW, in fact this is how men used to think 30-40 years ago, priorities are fucked up now, that's all."
2910,"Yes 100%. A partner will not ”solve” anything. Same way a boyfriend will not sudden make a womans life better. I think when you both have your shit together and have your own individual lives, then you are able to share your lives and experiences with eachother. In a sense, you are both independent, together."
2911,"Good!  Then when you are on a date you can ask ""so what do you bring to the table?"""
2912,"If it flies, floats, or fucks, rent it."
2913,i thought the point of mgtow is to not have any more girlfriends?
2914,"what's the old saying?

You will lose a lot of money chasing women.. but you won't lose women chasing money"
2915,"No matter what anyone says, your biology is going to predispose you towards wanting to mate. At a certain age, when your sex hormones kick in, and you have a sex drive, as sure the moon exerts an influence on the tides - you are going to feel a pull towards whatever is your sexual preference. That's just Nature / Life at work. It's an undeniable fact, for most people. 

Unfortunately, this can play havoc with you. And it does; for men and women. As this sub is focused on men and men's issues, we focus on that. In a way, ""MGTOW"" or ""GYOW"" is really a form of transcendency. That is to say, to transcend your natural drives; master them and shape them, so you create a form of life that suits you best. That's really just the beginning though. 

Over time, you change as a man. Your testosterone levels go up, peak, and then come down. Many men, mellow out, with time and age. They are less aggressive or seek to be less dominant over others. And a whole host of other changes.

There's inherently wrong with having different kinds of relationships with people. In fact, you need to relate and work with many different kinds of people over your life time. Men and Women, have been trying to figure each other out for who knows how long. Perhaps since the dawn of time. We form complex relationships with each other; whether it's family, friends or lovers. Some are long term relationships and some are short term. We all make mistakes; every single one of us. It's how we work towards resolving them, which counts more than anything else. Unfortunately we live in a very strange time, where there is a sort meaning vacuum and people are just super confused. A lot of ""traditional"" ideas, have been thrown away, being considered old fashioned, useless and meaningless. However, that can't all be true though. 

* Dignity
* Trust
* Faithfulness
* Honour
* Responsibility
* Integrity

Are these values and virtues, really to be thrown in the trashcan? I don't think so. 

And really, finding someone to really bond with, is incredibly, if not the most difficult thing to achieve. It does seem like a fairytale. I can maybe count three couples, over the course of the last almost half-century, that I consider to have a really good, mutually beneficial relationship. The next segment is okay, to not so great and then there's a vast gulf of just mediocre, to terrible and then awful. But it is indeed possible to find someone decent. How, when and where? Nobody can answer that. 

And my friend, the only thing set in stone is that you are born and that you will die. Everything is up for grabs. Probabilities and possibilities; you just don't know. The likelihood of better results, depends on you and the decisions that you make. You may need to take your time and work hard at yourself and those you allow in to your inner world. You probably will. 

The only ""advice"" I can give is to vet everyone in your inner world. Make sure that they add to your world and you add to theirs. More than likely the emptiness you feel, probably really has nothing to do with women as such, but about the meaning and purpose that you are going to give and find in your life. Seek that out first, and everything else can fit in around that."
2916,Good for you
2917,"Women don't fill the void. They chain us to decrease our options. That's why they are called the old ball and chain.

Think about trying to travel somewhere. First you need permission from your bank, to see if you have the money. Then you need permission from your job, so you don't get fired. Then you need permission from the government to see if you have a visa. Then you need permission from the airline to see if you have a plane that will take you. Then after all that, you need permission from the girl.

She's at the top of the permission pyramid. The one factor that doesn't even involve the actual travel process, and this is the one that has top priority. And if you don't please that one, your trip becomes a miserable mess that you paid for.

That's the kind of stuff that makes us go ""why the hell do I bother adding that extra factor, when it doesn't even please me? What are my options?""

I know the options: hand, porn, hoe. HPH, or HPP if you want to pay for a prostitute."
2918,Also make sure your new girlfriend has a life too.
2919,"Saying the point of MGTOW is to not have a girlfriend is thinking with the original r/MGTOW mentality. Not all women are the same just like not all men are pigs. AWALT is a childish concept.
There are still women who submit to their men and are mother and caretaker figures who don't mind life being that way, these women are also hated by feminists. There's even women who actively have been fighting for men's rights before you guys even knew of this whole movement so be a little adult and logical and realize that while the majority of women all think the same there's always an exception to the rule.
Saying stuff like this is just like feminists saying all men cheat and all men are toxic.
MGTOW is putting yourself first, learning to recognize the toxic women and avoid them, doing what you want on your terms. If she wants to be in your life there's sacrifices she should make. And just like people said here, don't settle with anyone in any way that makes them entitled to take your shit from you. Be the best version for yourself that you can be, and don't let any woman stand in your way. If she doesn't like it that way then she can take the highway."
2920,"Women are a burden on men, especially when you live with them. 

I’ve done the monk thing and found myself wanting to jump anything that wiggled. /r peopleofwalmart were turning me on. Lol

I’ve done the pump and dump thing and that became a lot of work. 

Tinder hookups come at a price. Bitches be crazy but I did meet a few that are cool. 

I kinda fell into the poly lifestyle and have become what’s known as solo-poly. I don’t live with women or commit to one woman. I’ve actually had a few at the same time recently. They have nesters that do all the bf/husband shit and I’m just the swinging dick. I currently have 5 on a rotation. They feed me and clean my house and drain my balls. I don’t have to do shit. They have no reason to lie yet some still can’t help it. It’s pretty sweet over all but you have to know women."
2921,Both people should be in a right place for a relationship so if you're not ready never rush into it because it can ruin you. I know too many people who got heartbroken and burned just cause they were desperate. Live your best life and then if there's still some place for love find someone.
2922,Absolutely right...having a girlfriend/ wife doesn't make life better automatically... sometimes it just makes things worse!
2923,hahah u want a gf? what r u a tradcon?
2924,"A women can be your life partner but by your own rules. If she likes it she can stay and be happy together. If not, wish her good luck with someone else."
2925,"Go for building a great life, but don't get a girlfriend when you do.  She'll ruin it.  It's just what women do, just like a lion attacks and devours animals.  It's not evil.  It's just being a lion."
2926,You girlfriend will ruin your life.
2927,"We're sorry to hear that brother. I do hope you live for more than just your kids, but I am sure they appreciate it more than you'll ever know."
2928,"> Women can get away with this because men are always chasing and ""saving"" them, but for men this will lead to a feeling of unfulfillment because men are biologically wired to want to achieve greatness.

And maybe this is a part of our nature that works against us, an evolutionary baggage we're better off casting aside. By definition, only a minority can achieve greatness, because to be great means to be great relative to someone else. The majority of men are going to lose in the arms race of greatness, just like the majority of men will be betas no matter how much lifting and self-improvement they do, because the game is always graded on a curve. Individual men can rise up and down the hierarchy, but only at the expense of other men, as the 80/20 rule remains in place. What the majority of men need is compassion and a path forward, to self-esteem and self-actualization, that doesn't rely on throwing themselves into Darwin's grinder for a shot at reproduction."
2929,">for men this really gives them a big disadvantage with women and life in general if they can't fix it.

Why do men need to attract women before they can go MGTOW? This sounds like gatekeeping.

> Social-proofing is by far the most important skill to have in life. It's one of the essential skills that leads to a stepping stone to bigger things in life.

Why do I need to care about the rat race? I just want to go my own way.

People should love themselves but they shouldn't have to attract women and reach the top of society to prove their value."
2930,The point of MGTOW is playing the game on your own terms ... Not all MGTOW are monks
2931,"AIUI, the point to MGTOW is to avoid entangling interactions with females; by which I mean no LTR in one’s personal life and to be VERY careful in one’s business dealings with women. 

For some MGTOW, a STR MAY be a risk worth taking, but NOT to cohabitate or to intermingle finances in any way. 

For others, it may mean Monk Mode, whether that’s be for a short term or permanently. 

Other than that, MGTOW is about self-actualization and personal growth. 

But I could be wrong. YMMV."
2932,"Bro Alot of men here can't get a hot girlfriend, so it's easier to mask it with this.

It's not hard to live your life to the fullest with or without a woman."
2933,"If having a girlfriend and having that level of intimacy and commitment with someone makes you happy, you can have that. There are plenty of women out there who will be equal partners and are willing to make equal sacrifices and compromises. People DO have equal healthy relationships. If you only chase models, you’re not gonna find many like that."
2934,Was thinking the same thing. MGTOW was better than MGTOW2 for this reason. Getting a girlfriend undeniably dents your wallet and potential.
2935,That's not the point.
2936,"My new motto. I still have urges to text girls, go on dates etc.
However I’ve realised recently it’s pointless and too stressful to chase girls while I can focus on myself by spending my free time on going to the gym, spending my extra money on investments and be able to focus fully on education to get into my dream career instead.

I’m one lucky motherfucker to discover that at 20 years old!"
2937,"I fucking LOVE your post, did you by any chance write about your red-pilled or life experiences? I would love to read some more, if not, consider doing it, you've got yourself atleast one follower."
2938,"Not all carps are the same as each other, but the stream pushes them in the same direction. 

By the way, don't blame the carps, blame the stream."
2939,That's kinda selfish and it's not really a healthy relationship. Both people need to work on it. If he wants a relationship it's gonna change his life (though if he's in a great place hopefully not much). Relationships can be amazing if you choose the right person and do it right.
2940,but wouldn't having a gf imply promising romantic exclusivity and sexual fidelity? fwb is one thing but gf seems incompatible with going your own way
2941,Exactly what this Brother said 😁 if you're not in the kink lifestyle I suggest you check it out OP. It allows me to fulfill my needs and still make myself priority number ONE.
2942,This. We aren't priests. It's about wearing the damn pants.
2943,"I tend to agree that the acid test of being true mgtow is having interest from women but blowing them off for other preferences as and when you feel like it.

I especially like blowing off their shit tests, I get stuff like (A woman friend after coming back from an overseas holiday)... ""Did you miss me?""... which my answer is ""No, but I do miss that you didn't bring any treats back""..."
2944,[deleted]
2945,"Thank you for your kindness, my friend. Believe it or not, I haven't directly done this. 

Through some of my other comments, there are glimmers of the truth. To put a finer point on things; no, I haven't. I suppose if I might be able to help others, then I could be persuaded to discuss my blunders and the insights I have derived from them. Truly it is a treasure trove of what not to do, and occasionally a nugget of wisdom. 

What have I started, very slowly, is to create some YouTube content. It's not specifically MGTOW, but it is related to finding and living in a meaningful way. Believe it or not, I have some training as a therapist, so it integrates some of that. 

Now, if you have a particular subject that you find important and might want me to write on, I would be happy to consider it as a contribution here. What do you think?"
2946,"Exactly.

We spend years spoiling the shit out of women, meeting every single expectation they have and then complain about them being spoiled. Works the same as with your kids. You raise them to be people to get everything they want asking as they beg or cry for it they are going to grow up to be pieces of sh*t who don't know the worth if anything and are used to being spoiled."
2947,"You can have a gf, just don't give her legal rights to what you've worked for by cohabitation, marriage, or having a kid."
2948,It's about not having a woman dictate your life. If we want romantic exclusivity and sexual fidelity then that is fine as long as it is on our OWN terms. Understand? We aren't priests nor trying to be James Bond sleeping with every woman we see. It's about going on your own path regardless if society wants us to or not.
2949,"The exclusivity is a non-issue to me. The issue is men are expected to adapt and give up so much for their partner which is why they feel so lost after a break-up.

Maybe I hang out with simps but it seems like it's very common for the woman to have the last say in most relationships and decide most things."
2950,girl in your life doesn't mean they're a gf ...
2951,Anything you have freely chosen is your own.
2952,Fuck all the girls you want with proof of consent and never marry. I personally don’t risk it but not all people can go monk. I would still prefer to pay an escort if I needed sex. Safer and less problems attached. Today girls are way high maintenance and the game of marry and in some places even living together can fuck up all your life efforts. No ty. Bros is all I need. Maybe a pet when I get old and get a house with a backyard.
2953,"No porn, no masturbating equals more quality sex and a better grade of women.

I've gone my own way already.  Meaning upgraded my life.  Which automatically means upgrading to a better grade of women."
2954,Read the post slower.  I answered your question already.
2955,"I'll try to think about it, do you have an idea regarding a subject that isn't touched upon very much surrounding red-pill communities?"
2956,"I wasn't talking of our duties as men, i was talking about man-hating propaganda and media, and destruction of the father role-model in society. But in fact is our fault for not seeing it coming for decades and standing up against all this BS. I guess.

By the way not everyone has enough strength to swin against the stream, (or in this case enough personality ) swimming over the waterfall and becoming the dragon. I wish you luck chasing the dragon."
2957,"We as men need to start changing the way we treat women and show then they need to work for it, or be without us."
2958,"It's only expected because men were and still mostly so widely inclined to do so.

More people, and more importantly, young men are increasingly becoming conscious of this, which is why we see a large shift in dating strategies and the masses abandoning the olds traditional ways."
2959,"Pick something that is relevant to you. That always makes it easier. 

You have touched on a very interesting subject though. In fact this might be something to explore. What is it though? 

There is no *summa summarum*; which means. There is a sum of all sums. A coherent system of hypotheses; whether these are ideas that come to us from the sciences, philosophy or any of the other humanities - that neatly folds things together. At least not in this particular subject. 

It would then appear, that there is no central theme, beyond the very narrow confines of such ideas as - hypergamy^•. 

^•= I call to attention, the notion of hypergamy, because it is one of the bedrock concepts of RP ideology, as it relates to the nature of women; and for two reasons. 

The first is that it might very well be a retrospective projected idea, less than what reality actually is, in itself. Some academic work has begun to actually interrogate this concept, and it would appear, that it may not be completely true in an absolute sense. 

Now, this is not unusual. Often, with knowledge, and the discovery of it, we can at times, mislabel certain phenomena, because we either do not understand it.  Or, out of convenience, impose a definition that is meant to be temporary, but through common use, becomes the standard definition. 

That is to say, it may indeed be incorrect. This poses a problem to someone like Rollo Tomassi, Richard Cooper and a whole slew of others, who have purchased their position of authority on either, misinformation, disinformation, or pure chicanery. They have a vested interest in maintaining and defending their position, because, in one way or another, their relevance and in some cases, their income relies on this. They have a vested interest in their truth, as it pays them to do so. They have an incentive here, which also stretches further in to the lives of those who take their thoughts, opinions and insights as incontrovertible truth. 

As no one has risen to the challenge, or indeed opportunity, to test the hypothesis of hypergamy as such, the idea and those who advocate it, have been safe in their assumptions. However, this is slowly changing. There may be an element of truth to it, however, it may also be, that it has been starkly over emphasised. 

Just recently, Shawn T. Smith; a highly trained and capable psychologist, has very politely, questioned hypergamy. And it with some interest that I watched Rollo squirm, as the headlights of professional rigour and experience, started to question, what really might be a pet theory at best and pure speculation at worst. 

Rollo has the gift of the gab, and can twine a word salad of concepts and ideas, in order to muddy the water. He can, as a fall back, cling to the notion of the stories he has heard from others, and use this as proof. Now, there may be some truth, in the stories of others, but there is such a lack of sophistication in terms of definitions and the collection of data, for the purposes of deriving some sort of truth; that cottage wisdom will do ... for now. 

That is not to victimise or lionise him. We all make judgments of error, and believe in incorrect assessments. Every one of us. It just gets highly amplified when a personal misgiving is transmitted to a broader audience, that then accepts it as unquestionable truth. The concept may require some calibration, however, that may cause the invalidation of some of the key premises. 

We will see if the truth is more important than the individual, in good time. 

Now, the second part is this. 

The nature of men. I have yet to encounter a term, such as hypergamy, when it relates to the *innate nature of men*. I am quite confident that the feminists would clamber to screech out the term; Patriarchy! 

Laughable as that is, it is still a very powerful concept at play in our world. It is at best, a shorthand summary to describe how women have been exploited and victimised for the benefit of men. Now, before I descend in to that pit of hell, I'll stop. And continue as such.

Men **and** Women can behave themselves in less than ideal ways. Both sexes can be destructive, shameless, thoughtless, cruel and otherwise indifferent. On the reverse of this, both sexes can be creative, remorseful, thoughtful, kind and interested. Some men **and** women, can exhibit more or less of the above. And we can further narrow things down. 

Moving on; some men are not particularly fantastic human beings. They can exhibit some of the lesser qualities that they're accused of, but to wholesale clump everyone together, is a massive mistake. This also brings in to question, the measure or measures by which we want to judge men or women. Who is deriving the score card, and how are they keeping score? What are they enumerating and quantifying, for the purposes of judgment. Nobody really seems to know. It is taken as a given. 

There are no easy to grasp values to use, but general concepts of acceptable behaviour. They in themselves can be horrible stereotypes, or indeed, truths. 

So, we seem to lack a critical framework, by which to evaluate and comment on the nature  of men and women. Beyond the tropes of; ""Lift and make bank!"" 

My little conclusion is this. We need to be critical of accepted wisdoms, or apparent truths, and not go with face value agreements of their validity. We need to have proper discussions to explore the ideas that we have been given. To me, that is an essential part of going your own way; responsibility for the evaluation of information, for the purpose of defining a set of values that you can live a good life by. 

A very big problem to overcome, is the demands of immediacy. Now, now, now. Most good things, do not come about in the - *right here and now*. They take time to cultivate. It takes work. It requires some humility, patience and courage. And most of all, it demands honesty. That my good friend, is quite difficult to achieve. And it is a problem that has been with us, for a very long time.

So, there you go! My little thoughts for the day. Thank you for your kindness and I hope that you are keeping and doing well."
2960,"I am talking about also our responsibility, you say media as if it's an entity of its own run by itself. Let me remind you most big media corporations are run by men themselves. So yes we have been digging our own graves for years. The existence of simps should be proof enough that enough men keep catering to women and in turn making then expect that kind of behaviour from everyone. and BTW I'm not the op, I'm not chasing any dragon. I am a happily single man doing my thing. But that doesn't mean I am not reasonable or logical enough to realize that you can not neither man or women 100% all in one group and say ALL of these people are the same. Believing that is plain ignorant, even though j agree there aren't many women who are different."

I like to use r/ aww as an example. If you go to a sub like that where the content is directed to fuzzy-little animals and post pictures of Rare Kobe beef steaks and talking about tasty old yeller is with wasabi sauce, guess what? Your post gets removed and you probably catch an immediate permaban. 

Why? Wrong think? No. Because that's not what that sub caters to. It's not the goal of that sub. 

Like here. The goal is not to point out the flaws in other people, but to foster and inspire men by way of demonstrative success and results.  So focusing on what you can post in *every other red pilled sub* and not in this one place does not mean that ""wrongthink is banned:. It means that this sub has a specific focus and direction."

3035,"We have men who accept the ideology from all walks of life.

Welcome aboard."
3036,"This post could have been written by me, just by switching ‘teens and 20’s’ to ‘late 20’s through early 40’s’. 

By spending some of my most productive years prioritising women over friendships, family relationships, career and health I am reaping the whirlwind now as a man in his 50’s. 

For 20 years I fed my ego by sleeping with multiple women, seeking validation through that single, fairly meaningless pursuit. 

Now I’m working on that, and myself, every day. My goals are to repair and reconnect friendships, become closer with family and most importantly, validate myself through positive and productive actions. 

I count myself extremely fortunate that some of my oldest friends have accepted me back into their lives and I’m developing a deeper relationship with my elderly parents (just in time too given the current state of the world)

To young men I’d say, “for sure chasing pretty girls can seem like the most important thing in the world. Just spend an equal amount of time with your friends, push yourself to learn the skills to develop a career that you enjoy, save and invest and get outdoors and exercise. Basically, invest time in yourself and other people because when things get tough, some of those people will be there for you, your body will be stronger and that cash in the bank will help you to weather things like a global pandemic. 

Stay safe & healthy everyone"
3037,"Well said. ""A dull routine that I indulged because it was all I knew."" I wonder how many men chase after women for that reason: that's the only thing around for them. They have nothing else in their life to do. MGTOW is what happens when you are no longer interested in that game."
3038,"Ditto, a couple of years would have been good and then to have been able to reassess my life path. Ah, the benefit of hindsight though! 

For me now it’s can I be a bit better today, a bit healthier, more compassionate and understanding. Those kinds of mini-goals can bring me a lot of satisfaction. 

I really feel for young men out there these days, the same hormones and desires I had, but I didn’t have to negotiate this rather more anti-masculine culture and worry that if I got naked with a girl that she might accuse me of all sorts of things. 

Some of my team are young men and I see that some of them are suffering, one has to be very careful about giving advice out though, again given the current climate. God forbid I spread my toxic masculinity by suggesting that they focus on themselves a little more and chase excellence instead of just girls."
3039,"This has been in the back of my mind for some time. I've just been avoiding confronting myself about it.

I dated a ton and had so much sex between relationships. I don't think I made any new friends in a 5 year dating spree during my late 20s, early 30s because I was so focused on women. Then a 10 year relationship which ran its course, then again spending all of 2019 dating and fucking. It became routine during that time and, after discovering Mgtow2, I was finally starting to focus on more productive things. 

Recently, however, I've relapsed, and I'm so disappointed and angry at myself. I was doing so well. I went back into dating a lot, spending all my time with women I date, and keeping my eye out for new ones everywhere I go. It's like I suffer from FOMO. Although I don't enslave myself to women's demands, I do to their company. I neglect bettering myself, neglect projects, neglect friendships and familial relationships. Shit, man, I'm too old (43) to be this immature! I should be enjoying my own company by now, not putting pussy on a pedestal and distracting myself with it!

I'm going to bring up this realization to my therapist and do a lot of self reflection, because I need to move on from this FOMO and refocus my life."
3040,I know what u mean man. Im the same. I still enjoy sex but they bore me now. Dunno how many iv had now be over a hundred Not braggin just sayin iv done it all. I used to love the chase now i just want a fuck then drop em home lol. I need a new hobby
3041,">I realised around 30 that I'd missed out on long term friendships because I was spending the majority of my free-time on dates.

You described my life from 25 to 30. When I realized it was ""my time"" I totally capitalized on that. Yeah, I had a few guy friends but dating did take priority. Plus, being a successful player, if you will, took a lot of resources. I had to have my place clean and date-ready at all times. This included a spotless bedroom and made-up bed with fresh clean sheets. I went to the barber twice a month. Working out and staying in shape was essential. I had to shop for decent clothes that were reasonably current and keep them laundered and in the closet/drawer ready to go. And THEN I could spend hours each night on social media (back in the day was dating sites, ICQ/MSN and even phone lines!).  That time was spent hitting up and meeting new women and making and setting up dates. Even when I met women, this activity needed to be ongoing, just like a business development process. Women would be 'going away' and new women would be coming in.

Sounds methodical - like a process - and it was. It was also VERY time consuming taking much of my time and energy (and money too) I would cancel on friends if I had a date lined up because as much as I loved my friends, they were not going to get me laid that night. My friends are/were very cool, but I didn't choose them because they were good wing-men. In fact, some of them were ""opposite-of-good"" wing-men - guys who would destroy any chance of success because of their age, lack of social skills, or just their appearance such as ""I gotta dress like the biggest fan of THIS particular music group.... all the time... ""

So yeah, women trumped friends. When I had girlfriends I would introduce them to my friends and we'll all do stuff which was a lot better. But when I was out serial-fucking multiple different women when between girlfriends... I operated MUCH better alone.  My friends are/were good people - just not good as wing-men. Fuck, I didn't need a wing man - just an internet connection. Not to brag, but whatever I did - it worked."
3042,"To all the young dudes here in their twenties, relax, you are fine, I know you are looking at other couples and wondering why I don't have a girl, or why is his girl prettier or whatever insecurities that are attacking you.... You will later realize that you are fine and it's all overrated. You don't need to bash yourself daily on dating apps and feeling so down about no responses or rejections. I was in your shoes, now I get the chance to know women simply from work or school and I decline the opportunity. Why because I have other things I care about and enjoy doing. Sex is maybe the only need I have and I don't think it's worth the trouble of a relationship."
3043,"I was a virgin until I found Leykis. His rules really work! I never put women on a pedestal, but started treating them like crap. It really works! But I found out how lame condoms were and figured it wasn't worth it at all and have been celibate since."

3047,"So you are the male version of a slut and a whore who've hooked up too much, that's pretty much why Men started hating women and are now going their own way, that's just my way of thinking about it

EDIT: I'm not exactly going against you, but I wouldn't want to be a hypocrite and say, welcome aboard, what a great guy you are, I would hate to lie to you so that's what it is.

Second EDIT: what you've written is pretty much the exact same thing women write about who've been in your situation. What I'm saying, is that when you do something enough times, it stops being exciting, you stop wanting it and set unrealistic standards, just like women who do like you, now obviously you stopped doing that but what happened happened and you became numb to the sensation as you said ""it just becomes same'ish"""
3048,I have a friend who is super popular with women and he told me when he was seventeen he had so much sex he stopped being able to get an erection. He had to force himself to stop he told me because he was getting desensitized. I never had such experience so I can't comment.
3049,"Agree with you there. 

I was in a culture that promoted the idea that unless you were with a woman (steady supply of fucks, or a girlfriend) that you were a complete loser...so I was always afraid to lose the one I was with OR i never dumped them no matter what cunts they were (except for cheating, but the man is still seen as weak of it happened). Being alone wrecked me, not BECAUSE I was alone, but because I cared what others thought of me...people I hated, even.

I am with a woman now, whom I fully enjoy, who does a lot for me. That is my ""way"" now. She knows about MGTOW and is fine with it. If the relationship fails, I'll admit I will feel bad, but NOT for a long time and I could care less what anyone thinks. 
I'll get over it, get over her and get on with my life, probably alone. 

Maybe it is easy now being 50, maybe easy because I am not a codependent asshat any more, I dont know"

3051,"I think it stops being the end point of it all when a man has too much sex.

EDIT: or it just never is the end point.."
3052,"For me it is always the damn end point. I’m getting closer to the 4th floor and it still is the end point when meeting someone new. It’s just like OP says: MGTOW focus not on chasing and idolizing women but yourself, and most often than not one of the things that makes us happy is satisfying our sexual needs, as simple as that."
3053,The problem is people see the guys who are in the red pill rage phase and write off MGTOW as just guys who are angry with women. They don’t ever see the guys who have gotten past the rage phase and moved on to accepting that society has built this current structure and the only sane thing for a man to do is to stop supporting said society and walking away from it.
3054,Nah just go to mgtow 1 page and you will see bunch of woman are under us and aita shit which i dont like thats why i like this sub more
3055,"I think people apply different definitions to MGTOW.. I am somewhat averse towards female nature, but I see it's not their fault, it's just evolution.  The strong survive, the weak perish.. there is no morality to nature and evolution... they are what they are. Cruel to the weak. As a man you have everything to prove. As a woman, you have nothing to prove.. you merely need to spread your legs and be submissive. 

I think there's a lot more people who ""dislike"" women in the MGTOW camp than you think. It's good to get rid of that hatred because hatred is ultimately self defeating though.  Would you get mad at a bear for attacking you when you are wandering around the Alaskan wilderness, or a Lion for attacking you wandering around the African wilderness?

I think part of the problem is once men reach the phase of peace of mind, they leave places like reddit and don't come back much, like I do when I'm gone for months at a time.. so then you only hear the problem cases, and the resolved cases don't get as much attention."

3063,"Well, that greatly accelerate the process in most..."
3064,"Yes I agree.  When I have been in a discussion with a feminist and they look through my subs and see MGTOW2 in the list they immediately call me an incel and feel they can dismiss anything I say because I must be a women hating scumbag.

I have a feeling that the original MGTOW was infiltrated by multiple feminists who pretended to be MGTOW and very RedPill and made the sub extremely toxic.  It is possible some of the scum there were legit angry women hating men as they certainly do exist.  But that has never been what MGTOW really stood for."
3065,"I was kicked out of a debate-based FB group when I pointed out MGTOW =/= incels. Any time I countered them, I'd get swarmed with screenshots and links to incel posts  on MGTOW subs. I wish they'd stop intertwining with actual MGTOW."
3066,That's what happened to the original MGTOW page. It wasn't like that before but Reddit stupidly banned actual incel subs and most of them started migrating less hateful subs and ruined them.
3067,"I think people sometimes forget that because  a person doesn't like what specific women DID to a guy, or how women in general are behaving these days, doesn't mean he \*HATES WOMEN\*. This is a construct women, as a gender,  have created. ""If you disagree with us or call us out in *any way* that means you HATE US and are the enemy."" This seems to be consistent with alt-left / regressive left / SJW thinking where if you disagree with (or even dare QUESTION) their tenets or beliefs you're automatically an ""ist"" (misogynist, racist, ageist, heightist, ableist, etc. etc.)

I've always said as a MGTOW - I don't hate women but I certainly hate shitty female behavior and these days there is quite a lot of it. I hate a lot of things toddlers and infants do (constantly shitting themselves, tantrums, ruining great wine and cheese parties...) but they don't call me an baby hater do they? Because people understand how f\*cking annoying a baby or a toddler can be - even their own mothers. Yet, women as a gender have this collective ego shield where if you say one damned thing about them - even something as true as 'water is wet' you're immediately a woman-hating asshole.

It's called the ""Women Are Wonderful"" effect and they use this CONTINUALLY to claim ALL MGTOW are just seething misogynists. This is how they conveniently write us off the page so they can ignore a Bible-size list of TRUTH BOMBS we drop on their pretty little heads each and every day.

So no, MGTOW don't hate women. Women, however, LOATHE MGTOW."

3071,"true, I like that you respected my opinion and didn't get to defensive, I respect that, thank you <3"
3072, I guess we only think like that because we didn't.
3073,"Was 19 In college, dated and fucked daily a bi-polar girl. I didn't understand what bi-polar meant then, but boy did I learn for the next 3.5 years. 

It meant it doesn't matter how good the sex is. We still got issues we'll never get past because we can't communicate rationally."
3074,"Eh, there is space for rage. I merely look at it as the reaction to discovering that what you have been told all your life is actually just a total fabrication. There would be less of this if people would just be honest with kids about dating in general, that it’s a shit hand that guys have and that yes, they are going to have to wait till they get enough coin and career success to get a girl of any worth and that they are better off investing the energy hey otherwise would extend into chasing women and dating in general. For most young men it is financially detrimental to date. Furthermore, society has in large parts removed the gender roles for females but notice that no such reprieve has been granted to men who are still expected to do the chasing, paying for dates etc etc."
3075,"You need to understand that people who do that have already decided that MGTOW is all incels and until they are on the receiving end of the red pill there can be no convincing a person otherwise. Remember , men don’t red pill other men, women and society do that."
3076,"And a lot of people, myself included, got banned from r/mgtow for calling out misogyny"
3077,"Hence the hashtag #believeallwomen
That’s a huge amount of people that I’m forced to believe in, right? It’s just like Bill Burr said: “believe all women? Including the psychos that key your car”, and yeah I agree, I don’t think so. Time to question all of our child-induced beliefs, change them and get ready to start a new fucking era, after all we’re living through challenging, social-distancing times, because remember: the day this pandemic shit is over, and we’re able to open our doors again to go outside, the world is going to be a whole different place"
3078,"That must have been tough... In my experience, almost all of them are bi-(or tri-)polar and impossible to communicate rationally as expected from the people for whom the truth is neither here or there and whom are only concerned about how much they can get away with..."
3079,I noticed that all women I know flip under pressure. The  negative effect is on par with both types of Bipolar.
3080,"The Blue Pill hive cannot exist telling the truth. The Blue Pill world is built on lie after lie (construct after construct). Mothers lie to their own sons because they have a lizard-brain drive to be on team girl. ""Just be nice and a girl will like you one day."" Like WHAT THE FUCK?!?! That's tantamount to child abuse.

I really feel sorry for boys and young men supervised by women instead of being raised by a proper father."
3081,"My son was dating a college aged girl who came from extremely rich family, and he told me she threw a fit because he didn't pay for absolutely everything.  He had just spent several days being her personal  tour guide, driving her to beaches and clubs, a lot of eating out,  and he was running low on funds.  It was sad to see him question whether  it was alright to ask  her to pay for food once or twice."
3082,"> society has in large parts removed the gender roles for females but notice that no such reprieve has been granted to men who are still expected to do the chasing, paying for dates etc etc.

Great fucking analysis, wake the hell up kids!"
3083,"Ha, I tried to click that link, the sub is quarantined now."
3084,"> ""the world is going to be a whole different place""

I sure hope so - because the right now, it's not going in a good direction. Love Bill Burr by the way... if you look at what's happening with cruise ships right now... Talk about talking ""too soon"" to the next level, aka before it even happened!"
3085,"Lol at tri-polar, perfect description of my ex."
3086,"Sad, but to be expected of a woman who was raised on a steady diet of “ you are a princess.”"
3087,You’re right! That’s quite the premonition right there by Bill Burr. That and the b/w special where he tries to tackle the population problem 😂🤣
3088,"I like what he said: ""People just need to stop fucking. Or at least, PULL OUT!"" lol. The guy is totally savage and drops continual truth bombs."
3089,"I want to check his cartoon show on Netflix, F is for Family, I don’t know if it’s any good"
3090,"I tried it... didn't really get into it, to be honest. But, I would say try it. It's going to be a COVID summer... what the hell else can we do?!? :P"
3091,Time is not a problem nowadays! I’ll give it a try 👍
3092,"True. But why deny yourself love? If full monk mode is your aim, you can still have love. It's just comes different. ""Golden Retriever"". Not even kidding a little bit. Best friend you will ever have.

Edited: fuck you autocorrect, I swear to goo..

Edited edit: oh fuck it."
3093,"I agree, stay hydrated"
3094,"True, but I really do miss the feeling of being loved."
3095,"Distinguishing between sex, romantic love, and commitment is important. Also important to me is making a distinction between physical affection, sex, romantic love, and commitment. To me, physical affection with another human being is the one thing my life does have to include in order for me to thrive and avoid depression. Sorry dog lovers -- I tried getting a dog and it just didn't do it for me.

It is possible to get plenty of physical affection without sex, romantic love, or commitment, via professional cuddlers. If that had been available to me in the past, it would have saved me a lot of depressive episodes and other disasters in my life."
3096,"Correction: your life doesn't have to include love *from women*. Other creatures are capable of authentic love, lacking pretense."
3097,"I'm surprised to see a blue check mark say something like that.

The reason is that, for the past several years, we've seen nothing but all these stories about how ""science shows"" that men ""need"" sex and female companionship to be ""healthy.""

There are still some who are sticking by that, like the Campaign Against Sex Robots woman.  I've also seen some pushback against that from the femmstappo, specifically the whole complaint about the tendency for men to be ""emotional golddiggers"" on their wives, and that the wives need to be compensated for the ""unpaid emotional labor"" of loving their husbands...or...something...

Which means that more and more people, I think, are going to come around to our point of view.  And if folks like Sprankle won't, the feminists surely will, when they actually think about this ""need for human companionship"" and ""empathy,"" and realize the implications for them."
3098,Sounds like what should be on every liberty brief on Friday afternoons.

3106,Every day is MGTOW day.
3107,I'm pretty sure I'm getting laid tomorrow.
3108,"Watching more ducktales (2017) the nostalgia is amazing. Also scrooge is literally the embodiment of mgtow. Filthy rich, went on amazing adventures his whole life. No long term relationships to hold him back. Got some awesome nephews and an adopted niece to take on adventures and fill the family/parental gap."
3109,Probably going to cook homemade Tonkotsu Ramen for my bro's and hit a few bars with whoever wants to go out. I need to start reclaiming some of my old haunts from she who will not be named
3110,"I'm going to watch the Barnum and Bailey shit show that is Valentine's Day at the gym. 

Watch a gym full of thirsty dudes flock to the one lone female in the gym until the staff starts throwing them out. 

I'm placing the over under at 10. Last year 12 dudes got tossed out and the year before was 8."
3111,I'll do absolutely nothing out of ordinary to signify it. Non serviam.
3112,"Friday is the first day of my weekend. Stay home, spend some quality time with my dogs, cook a good meal, read a few more chapters of ""The Art of War"" by Sun Tzu (an interesting study of tactics that can be applied to work, business, even social interaction).
Possibly do some winter cleaning on the 4x4 so its ready for spring. Cheers!"

3119,I'll be programming my Virtual Reality Racing game I'm making for the Oculus Quest.
3120,"Hanging out with my long distance ""gf"" I see her like once a month for the weekend. I said I would end it when it got complicated. It's been 5 years."
3121,"Tomorrow is Valentines day. 

I call it Ballentines day, (an ENTIRELY underrated scotch, fellas. I mean no shit, its GOOD).

So I treat myself usually by getting dressed up, I buy myself a long-stem rose and go to a steak house. I'll have a scotch (most places have at least a couple good selections). And I'll have a big fat porterhouse. I have beer with my porterhouse. Good Dark beer. Then I pay my bill and leave. But heres the twist. I leave the OTHER rose that I dried over the mantle for a year on the table, and take the new one home to dry. I put it in the mantle over the fireplace to dry out in the coming year. Yes I do this, yes its kindof stupid, and I enjoy it immensely.

I take the bill for the evening and I total up the cost of the scotch, meal, and uber to and from the steakhouse, and then I double it and put that extra amount (I would have spent on a dste) into my stock funds to make interest in the coming year). 

It's a stupid ritual I've done for the past 10 years or so. It just reminds me of how short-lived a valentines day celebration can be, and when I look at the rose that's drying on the mantle, I think of the money that is making me interest instead of just being gone. 

Sunday I'll be getting myself a nice young Korean whore in DC for a couple hours to enjoy, my dose of eros for the quarter.  

Then I'll kick back with some more ballentines on the rocks, and some good english tobacco from my grandfather's pipe, and enjoy picking my guitar on the back deck and watch the sun silhouette the hills before dipping behind them. 

Love yourself. Treat yourself, have a tasteful reminder of what you walked away from, and associate it with your increasing wealth as you do something for your own, pure enjoyment. 

That's what I'm doing on ballentines day weekend."
3122,Gonna try a new boba place with my Valentine before they go to work that day. Other than that just enough my bomb-ass chocolates and watch some x-files.
3123,"I'll celebrate by not celebrating stupid fucking imaginary made-up holidays. Just drinking beer and listening to loud ass music like I always do, and playing with my insane little shithead puppy and maybe give her some extra food. 

Sorry ladies, my dog is cooler than you. Buy your own chocolate."

3135,"Work in the morning, fix someone's car (for pay), install a new dish washer, then spend time with my son... I think I'll wait until he's over to install the washer so he can help and learn how to do it. Later in the night, I'll probably drive Uber and make some bucks since my city is going to be partying."

My grandfather's pipe is an old Hungarian type with a flat bottom so it sits and doesnt roll about. My uncle favored an old meershaum pipe. They both came to me as heirlooms, but I rarely smoke them. I prefer a church warden for cooler smoke and my tobacco of choice is usually something simple like proper english or any old downhill. I dont smoke enough to appreciate the nuances of a particular variety. It's just a good thing I enjoy from time to time to remember those old legendary Italians gathered around the table outside."

Bragging about awful sex with a fat ugly girl. Well you still gave it to her! And after banging her you have the guts to complain about something so obvious like her being fat and ugly.

3212,Fucking too right brother
3213,This is certainly better than MGTOW1 but if you need a break from tinder bios and snap stories you should probably unplug for a while.
3214,"I get along fine with the women in my life, I just have no interest in dating and find the majority of women out there unappealing, just like I do men. And I like being alone. I wish mgtow2 was named ""mgtows against misogyny"""
3215,"I don’t even believe that some of the people on MGTOW1 genuinely dislike ALL women either. The sub has become a place to aggressively express frustration in poor partners in the past with the name MGTOW attached to it.

People complain about the habits of the gender they’re dating, its entirely natural it doesn’t inherently target every single member of that society. Those guys just need to stop calling themselves Mgtow"
3216,You're in the right place brother
3217,I consider myself purple pill and think that the truth is somewhere in the middle. I still feel sexually attracted to them but I don't think that's even worth approaching them with that intention nowadays. I find it hard to connect with the vast majority of them even at a friendship level. Most of them look too boring to me.
3218,"r/MGTOW is now just r/Incels rebranded.

&#x200B;

If you have questions, or observations on life in general, r/MGTOW2 is all for it."
3219,Many here can attest to being banned from MGTOW1 simply by not blindly adhering to their mantra of woman hate.  Anything exhibited that is slightly less than frothing vitriol and BANNED!
3220,"I would take a step back from Tinder and Social media all together , try it for a few days , delete the apps so the notifications dont temp you to take a look."
3221,"Not all woman are like that but a lot are. As a woman I talk a lot with other woman. I notice how we can say what ever they want about men. Here’s some not needed examples: I only date tall men, that guys butt is cute, he is suck a dick, any short guy is not a guy. If a guy said any of this about woman, he’s being sexist. We need to get rid of this double standard. It pisses me off so much because woman preach equality yet say this shit. It’s not equal, society is going to turn woman dominated if it continues."
3222,"MGTOW sub is truly the male version of feminists with no logic or reasoning, all MGTOW does is try to control free thought and speech. Mgtow2 is completely different, as in way better. 
I got banned from MGTOW because I asked if they were banning people just like the feminists at FDS that want to control free thought and speech. It was embarrassing to know that the mods at MGTOW were not like us men that have gone our way."
3223,"Word of advice, quit using dating apps.  They're a pox upon society and the people who came up with them should be met with a short stop at the end of a long rope.  I'd also avoid even so much as looking at the OG Mgtow.  How that section has managed to not end up quarantined or banned yet is just a slight bit confusing."
3224,Not all women are bad. Alot of them that I work with at my job are okay people hell even a few O consider freinds. But there are always ones who you should identify and avoid like the plague. The ones who will ruin someones career just for fun
3225,"Mgtow is just that, going YOUR own way. Whatever that might be."
3226,Yes it is and I agree with every word you said.  You’ll find this a likeminded place

3228,"Everyone are not feminazis. Only a few powerful people are feminazis, they are making all the problems in the society. But How many woman did we see fighting against them or speaking against them in public? Little to rare. Maybe they won't know about these things, Who knows? Even if they knew, there is no guarantees that they will speak against it in public. Because whatever these minority feminazis are doing are beneficial for vast majority of the woman. They might say this is a bad situation in a private conversation, that will definitely make them look like an innocent person. Since we rarely see woman speak up against modern feminism, we have to believe that they are content with all these. When woman were not content, they started feminism."
3229,"In the moment I entered mgtow1 I see the room full of hate, harsh verdicts and was really badly surprised. I think we have really to renegiotate the role models and the modern feminism, that wants to pressure both genders in new negative role models, 
I understand hate, sometimey I feel hate too, but it's not useful. The idea of lying moribund in my bed looking back in my  life and realizing, that is full of hate is a sad idea."

3232,"You would think they will understand female biology and learn to live with it. As long as you don't get involved with them romantically, life can still goes on easily. 
Hell I'm fine with being friendzoned since I still make them pay for their own food, movies etc. No romantic attachments. 



Mgtow1 is stuck in this never ending red pill rage. It's time for them to walk away and enjoy life. I understand women today aren't the house wives they're hyped up to be, but it's not a big deal. Go your own way."
3233,"> I don’t even believe that some of the people on MGTOW1 genuinely dislike ALL women either. The sub has become a place to aggressively express frustration in poor partners in the past with the name MGTOW attached to it.

I call it ""red pill rabies"", where someone expresses hyperbolic anger against women, and others support him, actually validating the person's anger. It isn't healthy. MGTOW is a positive statement for individual ownership. ""MGTOW is freedom"" is so true. That's why I like this sub. Now go, my brother, live your life and don't worry about MGTOW1 anymore!"
3234,"Exactly.  I imagine most people feel very protective of themselves after a horrible breakup.  They become cynical of the opposite sex. It's not displaying strength. They did not adapt as well as others to a common tragedy in life.  In this way, the mgtow1 mentality is a mental health problem. 

I think mgtow1 is legit hate/anger though. It's like how I hated rich kids growing up because some of them were mean to poor kids.  Or how I hate cops because I've seen them haul off good people into cages. I am hurt, and I want to sooth my vulnerability with hate. When I say stuff like, ""Cops are bastards,"" I'm not in denial that I'm expressing anger and hatred. I am NOT being misunderstood. I am making **dehumanizing generalizations** about a large group of people, and people will condemn me for thar behavior deservingly.

Although perhaps I'm tone policing. If someone is right, it's ad hom to say, ""u mad, bro?"""
3235,I think mgtow1 is fine. It’s a good place to vent. Although I would change the name to “Post-roasties” because it’s obvious the people there are still holding on to some baggage from bad relationships.
3236,I think TFM kinda expresses it best. MGTOW is a path or cycle that begins in unadulterated hate and rage. I think many in mgtow1 are just in that part of the cycle. I just wish there was a sub for every state of the path

3239,"I try over and over and somehow I keep breaking. what pissed me off most was that I messaged a girl on Tinder and she really led me on, all the way up until I jerked off to one of her pics (I was 30 days clean on nofap). Turns out she's just a camgirl trying to get a new customer.

I felt so empty.

No more girls until I straighten out my own life."
3240,"Women get away with all of that because of the halo effect that they hide behind. It's really not 100% their fault if you ask me. It's men's faults for being sex addicts and letting women step all over them. If their man denies them anything, they threaten him with sexual rejection.

I think I read somewhere that 75% of women turn down 90% of men just so they can try to get the 'perfect' man, which is 10% of men. I forget the numbers, but they're ballpark.

Tinder is a perfect example of that. I read on a social experiment that average-looking women get more likes and matches than above-average looking men. I tried it myself and put a stock photo of a decent looking girl on a fake account (just one pic, no bio and no other info) and got over 100 likes in a day then deleted it. I believe I'm a good looking guy (not a 9 or 10/10 by any means) and I have racked up about 30 likes in a month.

And then it's even more heartbreaking when I'm around girls who are always talking about how there are no good men around anymore. It really hurts, and it makes me question myself. I wish I could tell them that, but it would just make me look worse.


And that's what brought me here. I'm not ashamed to say that I'm tired of hurt feelings. I'm just going to go my own way until I figure my life out, and maybe even cross paths with someone who isn't perfect, but at least respects my values (doesn't have to agree) and treats me like a human being.

And hey, thanks for understanding both sides and thanks for reading."

If they saw that ALL humans are animals with antisocial facets, they would not focus specifically on women.  They'd instead be on subreddits discussibg psychology or ethics or philosophy or current events or lit, just like everyone else that recognizes human flaws as universal and does not scapegoat one group of people.

. I don't need an incel like forum to express mgtow ideas. Dude I'm basically just against marriage, working slave jobs, and question how ofteb both partners actually *really really* want kids. Said right, that can be a topic for polite conversation anywhere!  It's not a conspiracy victimizing me.  It's social commentary. Everyone does it."
3244,"> You would think they will understand female biology and learn to live with it. 

Most of them do, eventually.

> Mgtow1 is stuck in this never ending red pill rage.

/r/mgtow is a subreddit, not a person.  It doesn't learn anything.

Its individual contributors do.  They get past their rage, and then generally move on.  They might still participate on the sub, but with less of the rage-memes and so on.

However, every day thousands of new men are born into the world, and trained to be bluepilled.  Eventually many will become redpilled and will enter the rage phase.  Then they join /r/mgtow and many other subs.

There will always be more new MGTOW than experienced ones, because MGTOW is a growing group.  

You might feel like you're speaking into the void when you try to help them, but you're not.  You actually are helping people.  It is just that the people you help are quickly replaced by 100 others who still need your help.  You'll never be done if your goal is to redpill the world.  

Just be at peace with it.  Accept that there will always be a ton of new MGTOW who are raging.  Help those you're willing to help.  Realize you can't help them all, but most will eventually figure it out.

And of course people will judge MGTOW by the vocal ragers.  Who cares..."
3245,"> where someone expresses hyperbolic anger against women, and others support him, actually validating the person's anger.

It's like they don't know most people who joins the sub, just woke up  to the lies they've been fed since childhood. When you've realized that everything you believed is a myth. 

You're not going to be all smiles after breakups, a divorce and such of course you're going to see through the lines and such but does that really mean they're anti-woman? 

As I said before :
Calling women on their shit = / = women hating .

It also goes with reddit's agenda.

Women can literally suggest stealing and hurting men. No one bats an eye. 

MGTOWs just shun and avoid women, advise against dating and the manipulate tactics. ""Oh no that's illegal now"""

I get it. It's a funny picture. 

But funny pictures, memes, and all that detract from the point of this sub. Which is more for discussion of independant male life through mgtow as an applied lifestyle choice.

Usually what happens with pictures like this is you end up with low-effort comments, and a bunch of ""hur-dur wahmens"" comments start popping up which makes more work for the mod team. 

Pictures like this would be better off being posted on mgtow1, which does allow for more of the meaning and images.

Always be making improvements and progression in all aspects of life - personal, professional, physical, mental, emotional and never forget financial. If you have goals set in these areas and are continually striving, you won't have much time to think about anything else but will be achieving new levels of success regularly. 

One this is for sure, if you keep on that path, others will notice. Some will try to latch on like parasites, and others will be jealous and try to drag you back down to their level. Get good at understanding people's motivation in relation to you so you can filter out the bs quickly.

3289,"It's exceptionally lonely. I would advise that OP avoids filling all his free time with *just drugs*. Just video games. Just pornography. Or *just about anything*.

I wasted at least a decade bouncing around addictions, and have finally settled on [beekeeping](/r/beekeepers) and reading. I never had any problems being a simple chump (i.e. dating), but have spent a lot of time, recently, working on just myself. I fuck up all the time with most of those past addictive personality traits — but have been clean from prescription speeds for over eleven years, now. It feels good to think about that!

We're all still young enough (in spite of being fifteen years older than OP) to make important changes. Even minor setbacks (here and there, if uncontrollable <-- work on that) can help re-determine the determined seeker.

I spent a good part of January on ""a bender"" (i.e. not taking my own advice), and would recommend that you focus on good things and filling your time outside of typical addictions (admitting that beekeeping is going to get quite out of hand, this year... just like anything that stimulates the amygdala and other pleasure centers)."

That's why we have MGTOW Monks, MGTOW 2.0s, Stoic MGTOW, Minimal MGTOWs, Nomad MGTOWs, Lifestyle MGTOWS, Grey men, MGTOW parents, etc. MGTOW is the freedom to live life on your own terms."

3297,"Okay this might be a bit longer.

At first there will be of course no damage at all directly from this i can agree on that. But do you want to read genuine stories or just fiction? I prefer genuine stuff. The reason why somebody might come here to write crap is to gain karma to sideway the mod bot. Look at the amount of upvotes this has. So after that person has made enough karma his posts and comments will not be monitored automatically and this person is able to post hateful crap what might get the reddit mods on plan sooner or later and the same can happen here as to the original sub. 

So something you said has got me confused. That is that being distrusting is a blue pill problem. Being blue pilled is believing in marriage, true love in the romantic way and in women being the angel like beings that is sold to society everyday and everywhere. When there is a problem it is too much trust as a blue pilled person just puts his trust into this belief. 

Also as you got red pilled didn't you accept the mesage that in this day and age the law and society gave so much power to women that this power can easily be abused and ruin your whole life. So taking the red pill inhabits an amount of distrust itself. 

Another thing i want to say. I noticed a behaviour in more and more mgtow guys as if mgtow is kind of religious enlightenment. In your post it is the phrase about coming from a place of truth. This sounds like religion and not anymore like facts based idea for a lifestyle. Be aware i do not want to offend you because from my pov you can believe in whatever you want but mgtow never had the goal to be a movement or kind of a religious substitute for traditional believes. It is based on a skeptical, realistic, logical view on society, ltr and marriage.

To sum it all up. I am a natural born skeptic and directly noticed some obvious flaws in this story and wanted to get all guys here aware of those flaws. Because just believing in anything someone posts and cheering the op for any crap that fits the banner of mgtow turns this sub into a circle jerking echo chamber.

So i ask you to let this points i made sink into your head to digest them and get where i am coming from. 

Have a good one"

3299,"Paragraph 1: I never thought about that, but I wouldn't put it past some anti-MGTOW fruitcake. Generally though, left-wing ideologues are the laziest people you'll ever meet. They make a lot of noise, but aside from pointing a finger and screeching some leftist accusation (raaaaaaape!) they're pretty much useless.

Paragraph 2: Blue Pill people lie to themselves on a continual and ongoing basis - they have to. You can't have that much cognitive dissonance and lack of self-reflection without some serious lies. ""If I try real hard, I won't get divorced like those other guys."" ""She doesn't like me for what I provide to her, she likes me for WHO I AM.""  ""Guys who get divorced were just a-holes or bad neglectful husbands. Divorce doesn't usually happen to guys like me.""  ""Hypergamy, AF/BB, Briffault's law... that's just stuff bitter ugly losers say. Females are just delicate nurturing creatures."" ""I can make her happy so I am not worried. You can't make a woman happy - you're a loser, who can't get laid.""  Right.

Paragraph 3: Red Pill is truth to me. I refer to it as ""Red Pill Truth"". It's the truth that smashes a culture and a lifetime full of bullshit lies. MGTOW is truth - MGTOW is a way to be true to one's self, and explore what one's true values are. Truth doesn't have to be religious. Truth is just something some of us seek in life. Others avoid the truth like the plague. 

Paragraph 4. I didn't mean to crap on your skepticism. I'm very skeptical too, by nature. I was just offering a positive spin on it. Aka, even though it's annoying or even offensive, what can they really do? If they're outed as a sock puppet or troll, they get das ban hamma, ya?

Not a troll account, just a lurker that liked what I saw in the subreddit and finally decided to make a single post in it.  
Get fucked mods."
3356," Someone posted a video of a woman steeling a baseball from a kid at a ball park and I pointed out that assholes who happen to be men do that too.

 Permanent ban."

3358,Just got banned myself. I called out a holocaust denier and not entirely sure why I got banned for it but whatever.
3359,"neato, I didn't know this sub existed.... I got banned with this account on the original MGTOW, not sure what for, but probably because I got annoyed and had a pretty unpleasant reply on someone's post.  Not that, that matters to me, I just wasn't able to reply on this account anymore.  And really if you're going to ban users for giving their opinions and actively participating in MGTOW discussions... well it ain't my loss.  I got things I can do instead of help change people's minds about their poor life choices."
3360,"I got banned, it was just a bunch of people posting pictures of mountains anyway"

3365,Got banned for saying I’m a woman
3366,"I just got banned from that sub. Awaiting response from mods as to the reason why. Upon seeing comments in this megathread, I doubt one of their fragile mods ever will. The irony is that the sub is modded by insecure males who have lowered and deluded themselves into the same rhetorics and tactics of feminist sub mods (silencing and ad hominems). There's no rationality or discussions there; just memes, hate mongering and an underlying tone of white supremacy. Unsubbed. Good riddance."
3367,"Just got banned from r/MGTOW for telling someone that wanting to fully control a woman is just as unhealthy as a woman wanting to fully control a man.

Oh boy they did NOT like that."

MGTOW has unfortunately always been seemingly dominated by boneheaded right wing Americans with little political education beyond a single fetid corporate news source. They're all for displaying their superior alpha masculinity for having 'moved off the plantation"" but point out out that right wing politics is nothing more than obedience to authoritarian institutions, debt servitude and flag waving group think etc and the hive pile on. They can't handle it.

And now out-and-out fascist sympathizers are welcomed to the fold. I guess that's no surprise given the amount of 'white genocide' retards that lurk there.

Looking at the rules for this sub and noticing one of them explicitly states ""no racist/nazi shit"" suggests it's quite a problem in certain MGTOW circles."
3373,"I was banned due to me stating that even though I am gay the problems of modern women is equally reverberating within the morally contradicting cage of modern gay communities (tribalism, ego boosting, hypergamy, increase in stds, etc) but because I am gay my opinion doesn’t matter in MGTOW."
3374,"Not quite r/mgtow but got banned from /r/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen for responding to this post:

> Is having daughters the ultimate cuckoldry?

> I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.

> Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.

> As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically


That post is freaking weird and creepy. My response:


> This is some weird creepy pedo shit. What are you going to do? Have sex with her yourself. As long as she makes you proud and does great in life, who really cares? Yeah she is gonna have sex, as long as she respects herself, who cares? Would it bother you if she waited till marriage too? Or is the thought of your daughter ever having a boyfriend/husband to difficult for you.

> For me, as long as she does not turn out to be a loser, being passed around by a bunch of losers, marries a great guy and does well in life, it is not too much of my business.

> This obsessing over your child's vagina is weird and creepy.

Sounds like the dude wants to ravage his daughter or is bothered about her ever having sex, even if it is her husband. Anyone that talks about his daughter's 'tight pussy' has some serious issues. That post is weird beyond belief."
3375,"not banned but I realized how toxic and hateful a lot of the dudes there are, people suck, sadly sometimes people you date or marry are shit, and if you decide to focus on yourself I'm all for that

the difference being actually 'going your own way', not posting about how trash women were to you every day and living in an echo chamber

I'd like to see less anti women stuff and more men sharing their hobbies and interests with us, how they spend their time gtow, for me I decided to take up leather craft and wood work soon, when I have a small space for it"
3376,"Likely the sub is overtaken by radical feminists (the mods) who want to discredit the movement, and they're succeeding. Apparently men are pretty dumb."

3378,"Got banned for saying that Friedrich Nietzche was homosexual. I ment it as fact, not insult."
3379,"I did couple days ago.  Was given no reason, and replying to the banned asking why, no response from moderator group.   I don't troll, talk vulgar, or say anything behind keyboard I wouldn't say to someone's face.   My comments and post I feel are constructive.  But the last conversation some seem quite upset, because I kind of took more of a middle ground position vs to an extreme side that is common in that sub."
3380,"Is there a sub we can post about the original MGTOW and how sexist, hateful and misogynistic it is? 

I got banned for making a comment and agreeing with someone about how the sub changed, became full of conservatives who hate women and are sexist. They generalise every woman, behaving like you cant find love with a woman and have a nice life. Like so many men did on this earth."

**My reply:** When did MGTOW become an incel apologist sub? Forget ""the female"" and go your own way already.

Banned for espousing the supposed philosophy of the sub. Also, the quoted comment has 70-something upvotes."
3383,"Another banned member.

Not sure whats going on there. Maybe a woman infiltrated the mods."
3384,"Been posting and commenting almost two full years there.  I was banned for I don't know what.

Just as well... those illiterate, thin-skinned pantywaists are jumping the shark, even as we type."
3385,What I don't get about this page is that you can't even speak about female nature or just to drop some knowledge
3386,"Wow this is amazing haha exactly my experience in the about.  Banned for reminiscing when MGTOW was about guys sharing their fishing trips, etc."

3388,"I’ve just been banned for asking what the difference is between extreme feminism and MGTOW.. it was a genuine question, why did they ban me?"
3389,"This is very weird, unless some of you people act like white knights, or defend women... i been posting on MGTOW for 3 years now and never had any issues...

3391,"I never got any motive as to why I was banned which is what annoys me most. Mod wouldn't reply and well.
Even shit subs usually let you know why even if I don't agree with their reason.
It's a shame since it helps the feminazis narrative and make the sub look rather immature."
3392,is this a bashing at Mgtow-channel now?
3393,Banned today for a joke post saying women quiet down after a sharp open handed slap.
3394,Banned because I wrote a post calling a few people out.
3395,Banned!  In less than 5 seconds
3396,Banned for calling mods simps. The level of hate in that sub is beyond a joke. There are posts glorifying the murder of women.
3397,"got banned for asking if there were any gay people there

before you ask- im not homophobic, or trying to start a witch hunt, i was just curious."
3398,I got banned for asking for advice. They might have thought I was a troll? Who knows.
3399,Got banned for questioning why a sub that is about going their own way actually had 80% of posts that are about women. And how ironic that really is. Apparently reasoning isn’t their go to
3400,"Got banned with no explanation as to why. Oh well, Reddit mods abusing their power is nothing new. Why would r/MGTOW be any different?"
3401,"Okay so I only had like 5 posts, most of which were innocuous replies to other threads and then I made my own thread asking why there were so many photography threads. I'm new to the culture and didn't understand what they had to do with MGTOW, but noted I enjoyed them a lot and then after some explanation said I hoped to find my own way to contribute like that as well.

Permabanned. no explanation."
3402,I got banned for saying that there’s a vocal minority of men bashing women and that’s why MGTOW gets a bad rep. No response either to my message.
3403,"Yup, and I've tried getting answers as to why I got banned. Still haven't got an answer"
3404,"banned for this reply :)

""we are still seen as abusers and losers from those who don't bother to come into the sub and look around.""
oh trust me, seeing this sub and the bitterness/sexism that makes up 75% of the content, doesn't change that perception one bit lol

For the true mgtow that focus on improving their lives and ACTUALLY GOING THEIR OWN WAY, good job."
3405,Hey guys im 27 male and i need a mentor someone who can sit me down and tell me about women and life if anyone wants to talk to me and help me feel free to message me
3406,Got banned for attacking an incel
3407,got banned for making a comedic and obvious impersonation of women mimicking their outrageous demands. All in fun and giggles. That sub is moderated by idiots
3408,"Someone posted a really hateful comment about an actress and I got banned for saying ""WTF man""

Really the post I was commenting of was a bit surrealist claiming that for this actress to be recognized she should be walking with no skirt and cum dripping from his pants

I mean, mgtow souldn't really have any resentment in my opinion it's just a way of living, I only have indiference for that kind of drama"
3409,"I got banned for ""concern trolling."" Sigh. What an abomination that sub is. The community is such a shame and unrepresentative of the ideology itself since MGTOW is actually one of the sanest philosophies in today's world."
3410,Hello. I didn’t get banned but I left myself after seeing the huge amount of cringe and woman hating. Hope to find some actual rational people here.
3411,"banned for saying a joke.. concern trolling btw

there is not freedom of expression with those cuck mods

never again"
3412,"I just got banned. I'm actually not sure why. I did comment on a post that harboring hate is not healthy. That hating shows that you care, that hating gives power to the other person to use against you. Then I got banned. At least, that's what I think it was for. I am waiting for them to tell me what I did wrong.

[Edit] I actually told them that I didn't care why I was banned. Then I un-joined. They don't seem to be able to tolerate different points of view. I guess they're just like woke SJWs that get triggered easily."
3413,I got banned for saying a man is obliged to provide for his wife. Lol don't like to provide? then don't marry. Got banned by saying the truth. Mods there are the equivalent of feminazis.  Just as bad as feminists.
3414,"It feels like all these banning is almost by design. Once the red pill rage subsides and a man is starting to have a mature, balanced & detailed opinions, he's banned to come here, I guess..."
3415,HAHAHAHA got banned for saying not marrying is an unhealthy mindset which is running away from the problem than taking a challenge to work with it. Well If you need to ban everyone showing a different perspective certainly your beliefs are weak !
3416,"I just got banned for saying that I was a woman feminist and support MGTOW. 🤷🏻‍♀️ They also deleted all the positive comments people posted in response. I guess if you’re a feminist and say something kind to them, you’re ruining the illusion that we are the enemy and deserve to be banned."
3417,I got banned for speaking out against the political memes that are being posted there.  The right wing is attempting to infiltrate mgtow and fill it with nothing but political rhetoric
3418,"I got banned for ""concern trolling"" whatever the fuck that means.  I pointed out it was possible to be MGTOW without looking and acting like a woman hating incel and if the sub wanted to improve their image, they needed to tone down the gratuitous anti-woman posts."
3419,"I am about to just leave mgtow1because guys there act like they cuckedtow. They believe you an mra because you simply make the piint that a lazy mgtow that just watches the world burn.. Is just as bad as a femnist.

For a group about men they sure do act beta."
3420,"What I do not understand is why so many MGTOW's mock women for having cats, when so many MGTOW's post pictures of themselves with dogs.

And hating women is just nonsensical.

One can be wary of them, yes.

But to hate women is to hate life, especially if ostensibly you're a heterosexual.

I wasn't banned, but I could tell that it was very echo chamber- esque.

MGTOW was originally about protecting oneself during a divorce.

They have posts with FGTOW's (fakes going their own way) decrying their own sisters, like they are going to be accused of incest or something.

That shit be weird."

3422,I was just banned from participating in one of the forums that saved my life because one of the mods is a frenworld nazi and I pointed out that they've been adding honk honk to user posts. WTF.
3423,IGTOWS
3424,"Got banned for saying ""Cuck"" is a tradcon dogwhistle term. Definitely some fucking tradcon mods over there."
3425,Is there a way to get that sub quarantined?
3426,Got banned for acknowledging the obvious racism and bigotry. It’s one thing to talk about going your own way but talking down on other races and calling children out of their names was too much for me
3427,"subscriber here on MGTOW  for 6 months but just banned one hour ago. 

Dont know why."
3428,"It was because of ""im only asking if you agree or disagree, very simple question, shouldn't be too hard to answer i hope""

He marked it as 'Low Effort'

Can't unban you again, sorry m8

You can still create a new account

So yeah, one of the mods literally told me this yesterday, banned for life

must be the worst power tripping mod on there"
3429,"RANT begins..
I have been permanently banned from r/MGTOW for no reason and without any explanation. The one place where you could talk like a free man and add value without the fear of someone shutting you down. Or so I thought. The mods have chosen to hide behind their screens and not respond after repeated requests to give a reason. I went back and saw my activity to see what might've triggered the ban although I've not violated a single rule. I might've answered questions meant for ladies in some other subs and interacted with different kinds of people, none of which is a reason to ban. Why I'm so disappointed with this particular ban is that MGTOW is a good forum for men to develop self-respect and develop their personalities independent of their SMV, to rid themselves of societal baggage. This ban has thrown all that to the dogs and made me question if a good part of its members are really cucks who just want to have the feminazi experience because they are deprived of it elsewhere...
Mods- u/gege33, u/ss_camaro, u/Mojo_666, u/ThatCard , u/PowerfulAudience, u/godsknowledge

3431,"Got banned for pointing out that an incel meme was posted. I think, I don't know and they won't communicate with me."
3432,Banned. Unsure why. I Guess I'm not edgy enough
3433,"I was banned for posting motivational quotes and such, I still don't fully understand why I was banned. The idea of MGTOW is still cool and I'll follow it."
3434,I got banned for opposing the incel invasion when their sub got shut down. They overran us and the mods welcomed it.
3435,"Was just banned for saying that MGTOW is loosing its way and that its becoming hateful and centered around women (the opposite of what it should be). Got several salty comments before someone sent me to this subreddit and I can happily say that it is much more appealing than that hateful crap. Glad to see that we're all on the same page, cheers guys.

Edit: the mods said I was banned for ""trolling"""
3436,"I got banned when they posted a tweet that was clearly joking and they were shitting all over the girl, so I said I thought she was joking and it was obvious and got banned."
3437,I didn't get banned. All it took was a real jerks comment on a post to realize that I really wasn't wasting my time with those people.
3438,I got banned for calling out racism. For noting how people were posting alt-right/Trump stuff
3439,"MGTOW is turning into a woman hating circle jerking echo chamber.    They have lost the MGTOW way.  

Freedom of speech/debate is the fundamental concept of any free society;  something every red-pill men should be embracing.  

When you start banning people (even your own MGTOW bro) for breathing the wrong way,  you've been corrupted.  

Power = Corruption.   When mod are given unlimited power to silence anyone,  this is what you get."
3440,I suggested someone might be gay because they said all girls are a 4/10 at best
3441,"Hope it’s okay that I chime in here. I’m a lady and I made a post asking about MGTOW bc I was just genuinely curious. I was extremely respectful and was upfront about being a woman so they wouldn’t feel lied too. A few people were nice and gave me honest and respectful explanations but the majority was just hateful insults. I got banned for “spamming” and spreading “feminism” 

I thought it was ironic that i gave them the opportunity to clear the air and make themselves seem like a legitimate sub and they chose to hate me for it. I don’t care what other men do, power to y’all for focusing on yourselves and even more power to you for not having to be hateful in order to do it"
3442,"I noticed lots of disappearing posts and called them out on it. I swear their are foid mods there and also i said that mgtow != hermit and ""enjoy the show"" while west collapses...I think that is the reason. Also I called them cucktows on another board just cuz i was done with their bitchy whiny negative demonic version of mgtow"
3443,Yea got banned oh well.
3444,"I got shadow banned for posting that the group helped me a lot, but my father was iffy about it.
I even was thanking the group for what they did to help me.
And then poof! Post removed. And my comments no longer were visible to people. I’m sad :/

 I wish I knew what I did wrong"
3445,Damn I got banned today I have been part of that sub since 2016 oh well today just been a shitty day
3446,"I was banned for asking if it gays had it better since they didn't have to deal with women. They surely didn't ban me for misogyny, but for not comdemning homosexuality I guess..."
3447,Got banned for telling them that the community is toxic and that they need to change their mentality.
3448,"Got banned a few months back after questioning why the sub is called MGTOW, when clearly it's become a hate sub on women. A mod pm'd me to start an argument."
3449,"This is the comment that got me banned: https://i.imgur.com/ThF0byf.jpg

I don't have a link to hand, but it was some stupid boomer-tier Facebook style meme that played on the similarity between the intitialisms 'LGBT' and 'BLT', like 'the only LGBT I want is BLT' or some shit like that.

I can post any of the links from my comment here if anyone wants.

I PMed them to ask why they had banned me, but I didn't get a response. My personal theory is that whilst the /r/MGTOW mods are likely not particularly homophobic themselves, perhaps they are being 'sponsored' in some way by far-right elements who very much are."
3450,Got banned for sharing a meme about my lips for taking Jesus name and not do unmentionable to women. I didn't see anything wrong in it. They could have warned me. They blocked me without any explanation. I am as MGTOW as they come. I don't know what is wrong with the mods.
3451,"Got banned from no reason apparently, got no explanation even when I asked for it."
3452,"I got banned yesterday for saying that I hoped r/mgtow was not the gold standard of men’s subs because of the hate. I’ve been a member since 30,000 subscribers. I like the message of mgtow, just not the constant bashing."
3453,Banned for making a post asking why they censor.
3454,"I haven't been banned, but posts I make on MGTOW get subtly removed.  I wonder if I'm shadow banned?  :thinking:"
3455,Banned for pointing out that trans women have done a better job destroying feminism than any mens group. I'm a straight cis dude with a post history so MGTOW it just offered me a Dollar Shave affiliate link.
3456,"Not really related, but I got banned from /r/whereareallthegoodmen for insulting an /r/mgtow user who likely only uses the ""mgtow"" flair/tag as some kind of ""cool"" badge of honour he can share with his equally cool peers. Oh, and I called them neckbeards. Just felt like sharing this somewhere and it seemed related. Because the guy with ""mgtow"" flair really gave off extremely strong /r/mgtow vibes and he made ""meme"" remarks entirely unrelated to the topic at hand. Such as hating on ""soyboys"" or using other political ""meme"" insults which would make him seem cool amongst his friends. And it being just a matter of time until I will get banned in the first mgtow sub. Granted how I'm generally not sure whether I really belong into mgtow subs, but I find it interesting regardless. If there's a problem, it shouldn't be ignored... (Also kind of sucks that I will never be a GoodMan™)"
3457,"I was banned for asking if they hate women, when the obvious answer is yes. They crosspost videos and articles that barely even mention women and put some snarky title on the post insulting them. Holy shit it confounds me. Glad there's this sub that's way better."
3458,"I randomly got banned too. I politely asked for the reason why and I never got a response. I don't understand how anyone can get banned but the whole sub stays up... like we're all one and the same. What's the point of banning a few MGTOW people when you keep the whole MGTOW sub, which encompasses all and more of the same ideologies up?"

3467,I got banned when talking about how I feel insecure about my bulge.
3468,"I was banned awhile back because I called out a picture as being really obviously fake. It was a screenshot of a girl straight-up telling a dude she rejected that she thought he was husband material but not dating material, and might be interested in seeing him again after she'd dated around a bit.

She basically directly regurgitated stereotypical MGTOW talking points, and I guess nobody else thought that that was just *a little* on the nose."

3488,Banned from two because I didn't vote for Donald Trump and instead voted third party.
3489,"Ive been in MGTOW since the day we were 9000 subs 
I posted some opinion about Trump (denying of climate change) and I think that was what got me the axe

I still visit the place , and I hope maybe someday the mods will let me back in"
3490,"Not banned, but I removed myself 

I just subbed cos I liked the description seemed interesting, saw a few posts and was like “wait is this a incel sub?” Unsubbed and found this one."
3491,"I was banned from /r/mgtow2, why don't we have a mega thread for that?"
3492,"~~Banned a while ago for pointing out that using dog-whistles like ""NPC"" was itself NPC-esque.~~

I've been unbanned!"
3493,"So... /r/MGTOW2 is like **totally** like NOT just about (or even mainly about) being a place for bannee's/refugee's from /r/MGTOW...

-
So much so, that when your original ""Banned from MGTOW"" got too old... you had to create a SECOND one; and ""sticky"" it too.

ROTFLMAO"
3494,[removed]
3495,Banned from MGTOW. Look at my post history for why.
3496,"I got banned randomly yesterday. Messaged the mods twice, and still no answer."
3497,I just got banned for making a post on why woman cant support mgtow. Im fairly new to reddit so the terms incel and mgtow are new to me and i was guinenly curious why they wont allow woman. I thought it was a great idea as i wanted to introduce a kid of friends of mine to that sub because he really dont have much hobbys and i hoped that sub could support him in finding his own way. But damn those man are full of hate and full of themselves and not about going their own way.
3498,I may be banned at mgtow 1.  I make posts there and they never show up.  WTF?  They're totally on topic posts without any flaming of anyone.
3499,[removed]
3500,Why did they ban me? All I did was make a simple comment
3501,[removed]
3502,Why mgtow banning people?
3503,"Yes banned. No idea why, whatever

I had got out most of my redpill rage, so I guess they sent me on my way"
3504,"So wow, I can't believe I just got banned from r/MGTOW. I thought I was one of their brothers. I loved the content that was posted. I didn't see it as hateful at all. I saw it as frustrated and hurt red pilled men who needed to vent. All was well until I notice some of my comments were getting no activity, so I made this post.

>I have been suspicious of any posts or comments I make that have no activity, so I asked one of the members to try to look at any of my posts or comments that stay at 1 karma. More and more recently, my comments are missing and my posts are removed without explanation. When I attempt to contact mods, I get ignored. Mods, if you have a problem with me, talk to me. Don't ignore me. If you are overwhelmed with mod stuff, get more mods to help. It's really irritating to try to participate in a sub when my stuff gets randomly removed for no reason.

When that post was deleted, I pressed the mods for an explanation and I got banned. If they really don't want to deal with people or the stress of moderating a sub, they should step down as mods. Just removing submissions and comments without explanation is an unacceptable way to run a forum regardless of the subject of the forum."
3505,"Got banned for advocating letting men go their own way, even if that way isn't away from women"
3506,Got banned for saying that you could meet the one early in life if you get lucky and they somehow thought I was white knighting even though i was just being optimistic
3507,"Well, here I'm... Obviously I got perma-banned without any reason that I may know, still waiting for the response.  
It just got me by surprise."
3508,Got banned for questioning an incel
3509,Not sure why I got banned.  It was a thread where guys were being keyboard warriors and really ripping on women.  Didn't defend the women so much as tried to get them to see a bit of perspective.  Always thought going your own way meant not caring what women said or did and you just focus on doing things you want to do.
3510,Yep
3511,"I just got banned five minutes ago for making a dark joke about a certain female who posted some crap which was posted on the sub.  Apparently, that's considered threatening.  Even though said rule isnt listed on the community page at all but can be found if you attempt to message the mods.  I think they do that for plausible deniability.

While reading their rules the hypocrisy is kind of stunning.  The whole philosophy is about freedom yet enforcing those rules means that people with a different opinion on social issues wont be able to post there.  \*Confused Jackie Chan\*"
3512,got banned for saying getting the snip is beta
3513,i was banned for no apparent reason.
3514,Banned for...something. I honestly don’t know. I wasn’t given a reason. Replied to the ban message twice and messaged one of the mods. No reply.
3515,wasnt banned but what's wrong with the original mgtow?
3516,I got banned from the 'witchcraft women against patriarchy' sub. Must've touched a nerve.
3517,"I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure this comment got me banned by whatever tradcon misogynist pussy is running the show over there now.

""These comments prove that a bunch of you guys have a stick up your ass and are opposed to people having fun. If you guys approach women with 1/10th the vitriol you display in the comments, you're never going to get laid, much less by multiple women at one time...poor bastards."""
3518,Self banned because of nazism. One suggested I read the Talmud to understand Jewish greed and malice. I’m Jewish.
3519,"I got banned for saying Islam was right (for the most part) about women.
when you allow women to run rampant with no supervision and no social or legal consequences for degenerate behavior feminism, promiscuity and other forms of degeneracy are the result. Thats all i said and i got banned. I would think thats common sense but i guess not."
3520,This MGTOW sub is far better so far. Refreshing to find a place where my speech wont be censored
3521,Cunts just banned me...no warning or explanation. I hope they all get chlamydia from a diseased hooker.
3522,Cucktows and MINOs
3523,Omg 😳
3524,Post post!
3525,"Hey coming from mgtow1. many of us had our suspicions about the infil, but nothing supporting it. anything you may know?"
3526,It is U/ Thatcard. Pretty sure he was inserted by reddit admins.
3527,Same thing happened to me the other day. It's really woken me up on the true nature of that sub
3528,"I was exactly the same.   They called it ""concern trolling"" when I said they could do better than hating on women with gratuitous posts."
3529,"Yeah. Because they think that the only way for a man to go on his fucking way is to sit around and post threads on a forum about how you hate women, instead of just visiting cool places, and befriending people regardless of their gender."
3530,omg...sorry thats ridiculous
3531,That's funny
3532,Now u know the answer is yea
3533,"I am honestly curious as to what percentage of them are newly red-pilled and how many of them are dysfunctionally stuck in ""red-pill rage"".

Red-pill rage is supposed to only be a stage you go through."
3534,Same here. It's like a woman is the moderator.
3535,Yes they are i joined like a day or so ago and im already wanting to leave the place.
3536,"It’s possible they actually agreed with you and the ban was to prove you both right and wrong at the same time.

Schrodinger’s bam."
3537,that's in their rules. no lgbt shit. hate those cunts.
3538,MGTOW mod: believe in biology of female brain until biology mentions gay people.
3539,Being bi and MGTOW is the best. I’m having a hard time balancing atm because there’s intimacy and passion everywhere.
3540,"Really its a game to make MGTOW appear to be villains to discredit mgtow..just like voat is a psyop to ""prove"" how much we luvz Big Bruh Weddit"
3541,"Did you make a post or just a comment? As someone who's also cut from the same cloth, I'm curious to know. 

MGTOW and bi as well. Understandably men are far less judgemental and psychotic and make great partners, so I totally feel you."
3542,"It's a terrible sub. I was there because I believe that MGTOW is important for all men, especially young men just starting out. But they require racism, sexism, and overall bigotry. No thanks. This is a much better sub and I hope that the majority of MGTOW migrate to this sub."
3543,">Agree, mgtow should not be political or strive to be it, it should be a platform to provide information to those who seek it. Not one to advocate for trump/hillary/whatever politician or similar stuff."
3544,Nobody is more obsessed with Chad than incels!
3545,"Yeah I got banned for agreeing with someone that the sub had suddenly become sexist as fuck, and pointing out that it happened immediately after r/incels got shut down. Coincidence? I don't think so."
3546,"It's ok to hit them, but only if it's in self defense and if your physical integrity is at risk."
3547,Can you share the thread with me?
3548,Lmfao me too - asked the dudes over there what made them go MGTOW and basically got half-assed answers and bunk science about how men are superior to women.
3549,"Seriously. ""Enjoy this photo of my hike"" above ""Woman cuts her son's dick off to spite her dad."" It's like a zen garden full of broken glass."
3550,Men hiking their own way
3551,Maybe the mountain you posted was too trigerring
3552,"Yeah, I just got banned for calling out a holocaust denier. I had also noticed a real slide down in to women-hating posts and very little about actually going your own way. Seems it is very much the new r/incels."
3553,"I agree because I thought that's where the most like minded people were for me, but they are actually just a hate group. I think MGTOW is important for men, all men, and that ultimately it has to do with investing one one's self. It's not about hate. 

They will never get out of their own prison. Thank goodness for this sub instead."
3554,Nobody will reply. The mods are just as spineless as the members of that sub.
3555,I’ve just been banned for making this exact comparison; between feminists and MGTOW.
3556,"Yesh they has landed. The pro hillary wants to be homosexual but still cant get inshills haz landed.

I got banned from pussypassdenied simply by making a joke that sub is like cat videos of crazy women. They r like.....wut???????? Still dont get it. No humor and memes are as close 2 reading as they get."
3557,Sounds like he was a total asshole.
3558,Is allowed here or not?
3559,So they proved your point then. Almost worth the ban!
3560,"I literally got banned for clarifying that a 'left wing conservatist' is a National Socialist. They rather have a problem with logic, but not with 'right-wing boneheads'"
3561,I got banned from /r/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen for telling some guy that obsessing over a husband/boyfriend fucking his daughters 'tight pussy' was weird and creepy. Hey thought this was being cucked. WTF?
3562,">because I am gay my opinion doesn’t matter in MGTOW.

Maybe at r/mgtow , but your opinion should definitely matter!"
3563,I hope you are joking...
3564,that's a copypasta from last year lol
3565,Some of the posts on wherearethegoodmen don’t even look like crazy bitches. They just look like normal people trying to put their best foot forward
3566,Trolled
3567,"I liked this one better...

Your daughter wants to slut it up and catch a beta on the downward slide.   


Respecto-boy will NEVER get 'her best', emotion/love/lust/pussy/asshole/tits-wise, but McThuggins is gonna blast his gangsta seed up in her cunt raw and call her a slut while he slaps her. Respecto-boy will 'luck out' later when he signs on to her shitshow for a chance at some boring, condom'ed, purely missionary-style bi-monthly access to her haggered out hairy Arby's roast beef bun, overproofed pizza dough ass, and sagging 'tiger striped' dangle-melons...   


You should have taken the lead a LONG, long time ago instead of letting wifey turn your daughters into young cum-guzzling fucktoy mercenaries that bring ruin to our society. She's a fucktoy now, you can't remove the many, many gangsta-ass dicks she's ridden from her soul, and she's eternally pairbound to some random piece of shit thug life asshole. Mocha Latte Bebbies will be coming soon, and Grampa gonna have to pony up 'cause McThuggins ain't payin' shit bitch."
3568,"Oml, did you report that guy?"
3569,"I got banned for posting a fucking joke about farting in some girls face, A JOKE, I wasn't serious, and some guy in the forum called me an abuser for that and other called me trash? It was just a joke. I know it was immature, but so are they."
3570,Definitely. I haven’t been banned but I clearly see the same thing you do. Loads of female trolls on MGTOW posting Incel type BS to try to discredit the movement. I just ignore them and keep posting and participating. I work with 99% women so I can see their BS from a mile away
3571,[deleted]
3572,[deleted]
3573,"Crazy you mention that. I was actually considering making one. I still think some of the men here have a narrow outlook on life, but I am not against the idea of men working on themselves (that will help with the ladies btw. I figured it could take a bunch of MGTOWs posts and debunk them."
3574,There is one: it's r/XY_Chromosomes. You can join this subreddit. The mods are more compassionate than the ones at the MGTOW subreddit
3575,"I was banned also, without explanation of any kind. I asked why and had no response.  Very odd and crappy."
3576,"Time and place for everything.

This is the sub for men who've graduated from all that ""woman nature"" stuff."
3577,"Of course not.


There are always two sides of every coin:


One side is the MGTOW sub reddit that have been infested with cuck mods who will ban you for anything that's not against the rules cuz of feefees.


And the other side is this sub that want to ignore female nature and hypergamy by overloading the sub with other subjects....as if they you to forget the main catalyst for why men went MGTOW in the first place.



The only ""safe place"" that you can't get banned from is YouTube. Peace brother."
3578,Just got banned as well for no reason lol. They got feminist mods over there?
3579,Echo chamber mindset would be my guess
3580,xDDDD
3581,"I posted there for over two years.   Banned twice, both times for responding to idiotic political MAGAt posts and daring to criticize ""dear Leader"" (fucking Trump).    No moderator explained this to me but it was pretty clear.

Lot of freepers over there (Free Republic knuckle draggers)."
3582,I've been banned and unbanned a few days later.  Doesn't look like it happens often.
3583,[removed]
3584,"femimarxist, i cringe every time you retards call them nazis"
3585,No not at all.  Actually a lot of us were banned from MGTOW for no reason and when asked why we  were banned we were given no reason.
3586,Tingles
3587,Sensitive souls aren't they?
3588,Can reddit award you a posthumous gold for breaking a record?😆
3589,"Same here, they are quick on the button."
3590,Can you PM me the link of those threads?
3591,I think at least one mod is homophobic.
3592,Same
3593,"Not only that, but now they have posts about little kids there as well. Hating on women is bad, but attacking little kids just because they don't share the subreddits views on climate change?"
3594,"There is a good reason for some of us who were posting photography. I can't speak for the guys who were just googling nice shots and posting them, dunno WTF that's about. But there's so much negativity over there. Sulking and stories of guys getting hammered on by life and society. I'm actually doing really well which is why I started posting my personal photography there. Along with snippets of little successes I'm having in my life. Life is hard, MTGOW can seem daunting to new comers and guys down on their luck. I wanted to show that you can straighten your shit up and have a good time and thing's end up positively for MGTOW guys."
3595,Join the club dude. Banned. I messaged the mods and silence. They won't even tell me what I did.
3596,"I kept writing every few days and eventually got a reply regarding a post being 'low effort'.

I think one or two mods there have a woman in their life who goes on a troll rampage now and then."
3597,Same lol I made sarcastic posts but they didn't like it at all
3598,I do need someone like that!!
3599,Totally agree. They get triggered easily.
3600,"Which is fine with me. r/MGTOW is a place for children who are in a suspended stage of development. Screw that. 

MGTOW is so much more. The rejection of hate should be part of it, as well as the intense focus on self around personal, professional, physical, financial, mental, emotional, and spiritual goals. 

It really should not be a hate group, which is what r/MGTOW is intent on being. 

What a bunch of fucking losers."
3601,[deleted]
3602,Funny. Cos I think we have the same goal. Autonomy
3603,I got banned for “concern trolling” as well. Apparently that means that you are pretending to be on the side of MGTOW when you really aren’t. How they determine that someone is a concern troll is beyond me
3604,Merely getting a reason for why you were banned Is actually amazing. I got nothing.
3605,It's been taken over by incels.
3606,maybe someone close to you is a moderator and he doesnt want to know what shit is going on in your mind.
3607,It’s a ironic that a sub about going your own way has become a hivemind
3608,"How was this downvoted?  


Even once?"
3609,"And then to come in here and see people saying the problem with the sub is clearly feminist infiltration or that the mods are cucks... Nah man. If that is a MGTOW's best guess on why the sub is toxic, the sub is just toxic MGTOW. No infiltration needed."
3610,"I can agree with that there are many FGTOW, but the mocking over woman with cats is just a stereotype kind of joke (i guess), it means that woman with cats are so desesperated for atention cuz they cant get laid (or something like that) so they use that stereotype to use as an argument. MGTOW posts pictures of them with dogs cuz it is popular belif that dogs are the most loyal living creature to a man. Than they also use that as an argument to prove that dogs are more loyal than the average modern woman. I hope I helped you."
3611,"I think there is a law of the universe that every group eventually descends into a collective circle jerk. The mark of wisdom is to know when to move on, and to not be to attached so one is able to move on when that time arrives"
3612,They closed incel subs so it looks like you got the toxic parts of it when they switched
3613,I definitely prefer MGTOW2. The quality of posts are alot better.
3614,"No, IWTRW (incels want to rape women)"
3615,[deleted]
3616,"I can only assume, but  we shouldn't try to shut them down"
3617,"Same.

Way too much racism coming from that camp."
3618,"one of the mods is absolutely insane.

i got banned twice already but im staying out now, who wants to walk on eggshells all day long as to not anger the mod, he's like an unhappy married woman, the irony lol"
3619,"I am so in line with your post brother. If we get put at the door,  we will move away and go our own way. We don't depend on them and bashing their own loyal members will be their own demise."
3620,"Same. Been active and in good standing for a very long time. Banned, no warning, no response, no rules broken."
3621,So we have a 2.
3622,"Got banned with no warning, no explanation, with no response from the ""mods"" and I was there back when the place started"
3623,"Their ban-hammer message say to reply back to the message if you have questions, but they never reply. Makes me think they have a very active rogue admin who is banning people outside of the listed rules and deleting messages from users asking why."
3624,"No reason given and no response when you follow their directions to 'reply to the message for clarification' either, right?"
3625,Yep.  It’s been highjacked by political agents and apparently they have mod support
3626,"That's because from his perspective, to be a 5+ she has to have a dick."
3627,That makes no sense since ?/10 is a relative scale.
3628,"It is a thread where men come to talk with other men about their life, cars, women, kids, jobs and the million other issues they face in life. It’s one of a very few places that men can be open, and receive feedback from other men, who’ve probably had similar experiences. We don’t all agree with each, but we get it. Some men have been through more than words could ever express in this thread. I’ve personally visited one of the women’s thread here, very clear about men not posting there. I get it. I believe you meant no harm, but deciding to remove a hornets nest in your porch is synonymous with attempting to reason with some of us. We need a place of our own to bitch and moan amongst our own. In closing, it’s what MGTOW2 a legit sub."
3629,Wow. That’s weird. Must be more to story?
3630,Wow that is messed up.
3631,Dude. Same this here. Ive been a member there for a year and all of a sudden I go randomly banned. Not explanation of what I did just banned and no response from my messages to the mods.
3632,"Yeah man, its a fucking conspiracy, lmao"
3633,"I got banned from that sub too, I compared them to incels for putting up a decent tinder profile. I think she was still hot, over 30, and no kids, so someone I would swipe right on."
3634,"If the obvious answer is yes, then why you ask?"
3635,"Yo, what's up! I'm pretty sure the comment that got me banned was a reply to your, lol. What's going on?

Though it seems like you're not shadow-banned anymore, nice!"
3636,What a bunch of cucks. I can't believe they banned you for that.
3637,lol. no you didn't. they'd make you their king
3638,"For that, you will get banned here as well.... it's still the public domain."
3639,"Dude, problem is you're too 'grounded'"
3640,"Shiiiiet, this problem must be worse than I thought; I got banned too despite it literally being the subreddit I have the most comment karma in.

Half the mod team are dead, the rest must be cucked retards."
3641,That one is back?
3642,"Thank you! I’m honestly all for men’s rights but I get slammed a lot and called a cunt, whore, liar, you name it! And I get hate from both feminists AND MGTOW. Like, how do we expect to move forward as a society to fix these issues if we hate each other?"
3643,[deleted]
3644,"Yeah they banned me for making a sarcastic comment. Some dude posted a picture of some hideous looking food and i said "" You need a woman to cook for you /s"""
3645,"I been banned like 5 times.

I had created a few accounts down the road to keep my daily red pills since I don't use Reddit for much else.

However, this time around I am pretty sure being in a mgtow sub where you feel like walking on eggshells like a relationship with a woman is last thing I want.

Fuck them."
3646,"Yup you are not alone man. As you clearly see here lol.

There has been something fishy since last year. I was shadow banned for about 2 weeks. Then I was banned for 'low effort' post and unbanned once I wrote them about 5-6 times.

Again banned again lol.

I think they are too concerned about not being perceived a certain way.

Basically bashing females is encouraged and seems to be a hard lean on male-victim narrative. More like a systematic way to impress young minds but censor experienced men who see the grey than just black and white."
3647,"Uh, Wat ?"
3648,"You shouldn't want to go back. 

&#x200B;

Or just make a new account?"
3649,So how come you're still able to post here? A miracle?
3650,Unbanned? Does such a thing even happen over there?
3651,"Correct, because people havent stopped being banned from there without any reason. And they still post here in the main forum, which then gets clogged with posts on the subject. So that's why there is another thread."
3652,Comment removed: trolling or incomprehensible nonsense.
3653,Probably won't get one
3654,Comment removed: nope. Nope nope. No links to murder anything from this sub.
3655,Post removed:obvious troll is obvious.
3656,"If you want to know who your oppressors are, figure out who you are not allowed to criticize."
3657,"The whole point of mgtow is going their own way from women and society, what would be the point of mgtow if you didn't?"
3658,How dare you question the incel
3659,"Perspective? No offense, but the moment you bring perspective in, is the moment you get hurt. 

But the last sentence is correct."
3660,Hypocritical enforcement of the rules for one.  Claim to be free speech and all for liberty but bans anyone who even gives off a slight hint of being liberal.
3661,It's been taken over by tradcon cunt rags who came over when the incel subs got shut down.
3662,Just read the posts you don't need any proof other than that.
3663,"Same here, man. I didn’t realize how toxic it was until it tried to drag me even deeper. I’m glad I’m thinking much healthier thoughts these days. It’s hard to feel happy when you’re carrying around hatred for an entire gender"
3664,They’re a hive mind
3665,"If there was a woman moderating, why would she do that? I think it's more likely some easily insulted dude."
3666,Or an incel
3667,[deleted]
3668,That's pretty meta.
3669,I made a post and was banned a half our later. Asked why and they said gay men aren't real men
3670,Or if it’s a biological man identifying as a woman... that’s fair game.
3671,I would but its been way too long.
3672,"Yeah, a lot of incels and woman-haters seemed to have joined the group. I miss the days when it was guys bonding through shared stories of why the went MGTOW and what they're up to."
3673,Yep banned for calling out hatred. That sub is dead.
3674,Boob-shaped mountain?
3675,Have you ever researched the 6 million jews died though? The jews were making the exact same claim of 6 million dying in the Russian pogroms a decade earlier. It's in their talmud the 6 million figure.
3676,Yup.. and still no response. Maybe mommy took the wifi away again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3677,It's literally just pinkpillfeminism except with guys
3678,Worth it in a blackpilled way.
3679,"Nope.

30 upvotes. I got 4 downvotes. 

Dude talking about his daughter's 'tight pussy' or her getting 'fucked in every hole' 🤮

When I told the mod he should be ashamed of having that post on the sub, they were actually ashamed of my 'virtue signalling' response."
3680,Thank god bcos I was triggered lol
3681,"> gangsta ass-dicks

***

^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37)"
3682,I was the one that got banned for calling him out!
3683,"That's my point. Exactly the same happened to me. I only said that my gf seems to be an exception. Boom ban. They want to make the sub into a hate sub an nothing else, so that they can discredit MGTOW as just being men that want all women dead or something."
3684,"Well I will say this when there is over a 90% chance you will interact with a womanbin some form and you demand that there is 100% no reason to talk about it as though it doesn't exist you are setting men up to fail. Because your mail, your Uber driver, your public transportation ride, & much more will include women. And all it takes is one slip up to arm her with the key to destroying you"
3685,"I get that. But to be MGTOW is to acknowledge certain things regarding society and women. But to dwell on it is simply NOT going one's own way. And to be so rigid in judging people is just a miserable way to live life.

In my experience the padawans like posts such as ""look at this post-wall thot looking for a simp orbiter beta provider"".

The masters like ""I'm learning to truly enjoy life being single and here's this car I'm restoring"" or ""me and my friend on the lake at sunrise going fishing""

The rage stage is real, but life is so much better when you leave it behind."
3686,Yeah one of those guys called me a “fake MGTOW” all because I “only” refused to do hookups and came into relationships cautiously because I knew the dangers
3687,"My brother to me I understand if it's hate speach their will be threats of violence but the truth is MGTOW & GYOW is about avoiding women & staying in your goal. And to avoid reminding men about a danger that is in their instinct to come help that's only a trap. For example a woman & her kids are stuck on the road, & a man helps without knowing that he set himself up for the woman to lie that he tried to rape her in front of her kids, just so she can get attention. MGTOW needs to keep that fear of contact with the modern American women who for attention will not only weaponize herself but her bastard children. We men already know how to deal with one another it's that danger of wanting to be honorable & helpful that women prey on & it's something we have to fight against every moment. Oh a women can't lift her package tried to help accused of stealing, oh a woman bumped into a you she fell you tried to help claims you touched her inappropriately. 

Yes by being MGTOW & GYOW we declared victory & freedom, but our guard must stay up as all times not against women but our own nature that will lead us to helping them."
3688,They are angreerrry
3689,"Yeah this is kind of weird, this is why i never follow religion nor politics."
3690,People should be free to pro anti trump everywhere and not banbed for it unless its trolling etc. Free speach isbunkown to most of reddit and trp is quarantined but incest and dogsex subs r not..insanity
3691,completely stupid ban and unbanned what ever happen to freedom of speech now there are a zillion rules to follow or you get banned before posting.....
3692,Sorry to offend you fatty
3693,It's all socialism?
3694,"I swear that MensRights and MGTOW are stealth channels that is  are psyops. There are lots of silly mods there,  that may or not be women, and the goal may be to give the appearance of free speach while shadow banning all posts that hit close to home or are too dangerous and truthful.

&#x200B;

It would be too obvious to outright ban ALL male speach so it gives them plausable deniablility and cover.

&#x200B;

Also many of the mods may be easily triggered, have a bad life, general mean trolls, etc.

&#x200B;

I think a lot of reddit, like IRC, and early internet, people camped out or bought names of channels/domains so that they could control them.

&#x200B;

For instance it wouldn't surprise me at all if a Woman  were to start a channel called MGTOW to monitor and control all thought that goes through there.

&#x200B;

Heck, men could run some feminist channels. Wouldn't that be funny. Laff"
3695,"Damn, same exact time happened to me"
3696,"At this point, I have already stopped trying"
3697,Yeah
3698,"Right. I commented on a post in where a couple were both acting like children, and was neither on the man's side, or the woman's side. I wrote about how both of them were immature, and how neither should be in a relationship before they mature a little bit more.   


Then I got called an anti-male cuck (for calling both people in the couple assholes) and banned. 

&#x200B;

Yikes."
3699,didn't catch your drift here mate.
3700,That’s exactly what I said! It is the same goal! Feminism allowed me to define myself apart from my relationship to men. And MGTOW allows men to define themselves apart from their relationship to women. I think it’s awesome for everyone to do that. And I’m glad this group aims to do that without conflating it with viewing women as the enemy. Cheers. Solidarity brothers.
3701,">How they determine that someone is a concern troll is beyond me

I agree.  I think ""concern trolling"" is a bullshit way of deflecting from an issue.  Concern trolling doesn't exist outside of reddit."
3702,Seems like they most have lol Mgtow doesnt need a leader they all gotta learn to stand on their own two feet and learn to fight.. No point in bitching if they wont do anything about it.
3703,"To be honest I wouldnt give a shit. I am always honest and wont be shut up whether people, ban, kick, beat me up, or kill me. No point in complaining and not doing anything.

While feminist and betas kep destroying our lives in society."
3704,I got banned for making points on why it's a movement and for disrespecting someone who was acting stupid with me lol
3705,Not all
3706,How? They banned me for saying something they didn’t like and I think that’s toxic and shouldn’t be encouraged.
3707,I got banned for saying you shouldn’t say all women are sick fucks
3708,i suspect a feminist has covertly broken into the mods club over there.
3709,He must be the same incel he swore to kick off r/MGTOW. Ugh
3710,"Same. Been active and in good standing for a very long time. Banned, no warning, no response."
3711,"That's my guess.

A Commie fag or feminist cunt infiltrator is doing it."
3712,"Bingo! Part of me wonders if they have a secret idealog Moderator that they don't know about? How could they be so wilfully closed minded?

It boggles the mind."
3713,Jfc the persecution complex.  Literally ALL OF REDDIT is men talking to men about their hobbies.  You just also want to drop in “and women fucking suck” somewhere you won’t get called an incel for it.
3714,That exactly what happened to me just unsubscribe cause there is no point anymore
3715,"Well, what's your explanation then? Why are they being so censorious when that's so much against MGTOW philosophy?"
3716,"Why? What is the preffered word for homosexual these days? Ppl get so butthurt and keep changing the preferred words... Unless the intent is bad the word isnt bad. Black, colored, gay, whatever.

They hate themselves so they ban u. Same with that story of woman who bans if u say female.

Its a crazy world of everyonevis king of their microbubble. Oh king! Ban! Im a queen! Ban! Dont assume my gender! They are just looking to make others miserable.

And it spills into the real world... It was busy at the gas station pumps and i waited and i finally started pulling into one and someone else who had just got their literally went ape shit and cursing me late 40s asshat acting like 5yr old.

So Im like u want 2 fight bro? And hea like yeah get out of ur car! So I start 2 video him and he fled... What a mighty wuss crybaby. 

The mods are like him x10 -20, years"
3717,"I think it's stupid, but okay. Thanks for letting me know, btw."
3718,you're joking. will you seriously get banned for that here?
3719,"Well balanced and sensible? I've been called some atrocious things in my time, but never that!!🤣"
3720,"tbf MGTOW isn't a movement, they don't want to fix anything."
3721,"we don't move forward.

 Isnt that obvious to you? 

Guess not because you have a woman's brain."
3722,"Seriously, it's almost like they are trying to give the movement a bad name and get it banned from Reddit. I can't say I blame the rest of the world for assuming we're just a bunch of bitter incels when the men who are supposedly ""going their own way"" literally just obsessively talk about women and nothing else."
3723,"Learning how to deal with people the best way possible is not niceism or blue pilled attitude, it's just a tool to save yourself from mental stress and useless conflict. Lately I learned the value of it, I think it should be a staple of MGTOW to learn how to deal with people. Monk mode is just toxic and bad for self improvement, even if you have s job that doesn't require interaction much"
3724,"I can't, /u/Impossible-asset banned me.  You don't see me posting do you?

It still doesn't answer the question why there isn't a ""banned from MGTOW2 mega thread""."
3725,Don't talk logic with him. Just say something horrible about women and he'll go away.
3726,Lol okie dokie
3727,"That is not the point of the ideology of MGTOW. MGTOW advocates for men deciding what way they want to go, even if that way isn’t in line with how other MGTOW think. The point is to offer/receive advice but, not to force your own personal idea of what MGTOW is down another man’s throat. This is why a lot of the monks have left the main MGTOW sub or even got banned for ridiculing how it’s members act."
3728,"this.   Freedom of speech for me but not for thee. 

Sounds familiar,  sounds like feminism.   No wonder people equate MGTOW to feminism.  

The MODS over at MGTOW (if they are reading this comment) need to get their heads out of their asses and take a long look in the mirror."
3729,"Im far from liberal, i oppose almost everything modern day liberals/leftists stand for. That being said and even being a Theocratic Distributist personally I believe in free speech for all whether i agree with you or not. The only laws that are legit are the original amendments in the U.S. constitution. Everything else has no validity. Any laws or policies that say you have no right to speech, privacy or armaments are unconstitutional, invalid and must be fought against. The internet is the new public sphere and free speech for all must be preserved and defended. (Including liberals Lol)"
3730,or an imbecile
3731,"don't use their word, it's a shitty insult"
3732,Dumb sub that will ban you for any little thing.
3733,"Dude, *WHAT*? I've seen the topic touched on in comments with respect, but to see that from the main MGTOW sub boggles me. What an asshat.

I'm not sure if you watch TFM by chance, but he's addressed the topic before. Going your way isn't just about relationships, but a path to self actualization without the need for external validation. Gay men and bi men absolutely can be MGTOW."
3734,"Sorry for the second post, but I did want to show an example of something good I found from the subreddit.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/744lyd/gay_and_mgtow/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I'm so sorry that mod was a flaming shitbag. Keep going your own way, dude."
3735,Closest I’ve found to any sort of positive space for men has been r/menslib. Admittedly I’m kinda leery about this sub but I’ll give it a chance; r/MGTOW has some warped individuals on there lol
3736,"Exactly. Men need to share stories, collaborate, and support each other. That's what it should be, instead it's a cesspool over there. This is a much better sub."
3737,"Yep, that's where it's going. Just an incel woman hating jerk circle rather that a positive group where people discussed what path they were taking and how to do it etc."
3738,"this exactly. 

Westerners have been so brainwashed by the 6 million lie it is utterly ridiculous to have an educated discussion about this.

I have seen the information you are talking about and the 6 million figure was lauded by jewish press going back into the 1800s for a number of events."
3739,I like to think that most individuals are sane in mgtow but this screams mental health issues. Maybe I shouldn't associate myself with these people considering what the mod did...
3740,Mb rip bro
3741,"No doubt, but we all already know that. Like I said, there's a time and place for everything. And I hope this place wouldn't become a place for that. Men seem to have trouble discussing women ""dispassionately"" because most have been burned bad and can't shake off that bitterness. In the end, it devolves into women-bashing all over again, like r/MGTOW."
3742,[deleted]
3743,[deleted]
3744,"I think that, over time, r/MGTOW2 will be more popular as it is the essence of what MGTOW should be, and not a bunch of fringe haters."
3745,You are the first feminist i have ever heard say anything even remotely reasonable or sane. Im shocked and impressed. I dont know what else to say lol. Two thumbs up 👍👍😅
3746,true way to go
3747,i don't think so because the first time got banned was because i gave the tip to not hate women but to simply ignore them and focus on bettering yourself
3748,Yeah that sounds like a reasonable thing
3749,"come on, lets not use incel as an insult. 

we should be better as that"
3750,"you can tell it's subversion of some kind, look at what get's posted now and the quality of the comments."
3751,"Yup. I am pretty sure there is a woman somewhere there.

Some faggot admin found his way in but left his balls behind."
3752,"The whole point for mgtow is men doing their thing and speaking their mind.

Some men will always have some reservations toward liking or disliking women that swings on extreme ends. But they have a very narrow approach.

Kind of good to be banned. Was being too pessimistic."
3753,I already have. Ive been a member of that sub from my other account since 2014 and a year on this one. Ive always followed thier rules so it is annoying to just be kicked out with no explanation. But whatever I unsubbed from there with both accounts.
3754,Cause you sound like a dumb liberal fag to the mods in your comment thats explanation enough
3755,"Maybe it's more simple than that.  Let me kick in an open door.  I don't think they ban you because they hate themselves, I think they ban just because they can.  What I believe at this point is, that one must present themselves as more than virtuous or you get cannibalised by your own kind, e.g. not red enough for a communist, not green enough for an environmentalist ... it's all very political in a sense that politics have become the new religion.  The Spanish inquisition didn't only burn demons, they got innocent people to."
3756,"It is stupid. You should be allowed to say whatever you want, exactly because it is a public domain. It's called freedom of speech/expression etc. 

So I guess the main question should be. Is reddit a platform(does not censor as they won't be forced to take responsibility for content made on their platform) or a publisher(a bunch of illiterates that censor opposition)...? Which one is it? 

It's even more disconcerting when the interpretation of ""racism/nazism"", ""women-hating"" etc gets left to a  bunch of overly sensitive man-children. 

What offends them, might not offend you or me. What they deem ""hatred"" might not be hatred at all. They just don't like the message, so they delete it and ban the user to silence any opposing opinions. 

Are homosexuals equal to the rest of us, or are they a protected class to the point where you'll get banned just for calling someone gay? Because that is what the latter looks like, that's then not ""equality"" like they bark the whole day, it's enforcing a ""protected class"". That's something entirely different, but that is the type of nonsense you get left with when a bunch of fruitcakes get to decide the ""rules"" everyone should ""abide"" at instead of leaving everyone to discuss issues, regardless of how ""offensive"" it is; like any supposed-to-be civilized nation."
3757,"you're right.  I was thinking about a sword of Damocles that hangs over one's head when saying something slighty off, when I wrote it.  It came across totally differently.  But calling it stupid might not be correct either.  If it's stupid but it prevents a negative result...it's just ignorance."
3758,You’re proving my point
3759,"Monk mode is toxic? Not sure what interaction with others plays a factor here.

What is toxic is this notion of self-improvement masquerading some serious underlying desire to feel validated from others.

A monk has achieved far greater self-improvement living amidst the constant chaos."
3760,Because there isn't. There question answered. No need to get philosophical about it.
3761,The moderating team must be full of those damn incels.
3762,"My way is the only way I'm going from now on. I tried my best with women for years and it was height and looking too young that made relationships impossible with them. Now that I have a man in my life who loves me it is like a huge weight lifted from me. 
Thanks for the support brother"
3763,"For a while I noticed quite a few guys speaking up about how the self-improvement posts had died out and all of the posts were about hating women, but they eventually dried up."
3764,"I stay on the fringes to be honest. I listen to what some of the youtubers and posters have to say, but the deeper parts of the MGTOW community have some really screwed up people (and some that aren't obviously). Some of these guys literally HATE women.

The fact that I got banned, the post has 34 upvotes and the guy has a daughter really bothers me. At least some of the replies are better. Although one spoke about that being the reason why there are selective abortions in India so they can have male children 🤮"

3768,Hopefully.  So long as none of those political agents get mod powers here.
3769,"This is insane,  they become full of themselves I guess."
3770,"Tbh its deserved hate if they make all in their power to strangle MGTOW energy, evirate our brotherhood and reduce it into a hive of loser insects spamming the same low effort bull crap over and over. Our rebellion is what will save this movement from self-destructing."
3771,"Incel or not, he/she is insane."
3772,"Without a doubt!

A lot of people who spoke in rougher language, the language **A MAN** uses, got the axe so it's prettu obvious some limp wristed faggot got his delicate sensibilities injured. Every fucking post now is a ""spoiler"" which is what stupid fucking kids use to be ""edgy and hip"" in their vain attempt to be cool.

Or... It's just some whore that has to make sure the menz don't get outa line and go off the script."
3773,I feel like that it became an echo chamber if you said anything against the norm you will be banned swiftly
3774,"> dumb liberal fag

100% *ad hominen*. IDGAF what I apparently 'sound like'. Either address the substance of my comment or I don't care what you have to say about me.

Edit: is MGTOW against liberalism? TIL MGTOW is authoritarian then, I guess."
3775,"Well yeah anyone who is smarter or better at anything is seen as a threat and not as a cohort/assett/friend and is instantly destroyed.

All the musicians jealous of my music or pua skills did everything the could to kneecap and ban me.

But what ur saying is a lil diff.

What ur saying is anything outside the norm must be eliminated. Like the japanese say the nail thar sticks uo must be hammered down."
3776,You raise a good point.  If you are not extreme then you are treated as some sort of mutant.  There is nothing wrong with having empathy for other positions.
3777,"Context is important here. 

If you show up and start making posts about ""this is gay, that is gay, I might go eat some hay I can make things out of clay, and lay by the bay, I just may, whaddya say?""  Well, then your post would get removed and the mods would tell you at least what rule of the sub you were breaking. 

It you persist at it and constantly become a nuisance, then you should be shadow banned or temporarily banned. But you have to try pretty hard for that to happen here. 

As for freedom ot speech. Well, yes and no. We do want to encourage people to discuss things here, as long as it falls within the direction and purpose of the sub. And that is basically one that mgtow is a healthy life philosophy for men. 

Its not a place just bash on women or complain about access to or lack thereof of sex. It's for men who are walking a mgtow journey and want to talk with others who are doing the same, and offer advice or answer questions for men who would like to and have questions about it.  On topic discussion. 

If we just said ""hey it's a free speech bastion"" we'd end up with a meme-littered negativity fest and before long the sub would get shut down. 

So yes, the sub is moderated to keep the level of discussion elevated, for the benefit of all the subscribers. I hope that helps explain things a bit."
3778,"I agree with everything you said, unfortunately, there's no fixing it. 

And it doesn't stop there. There's a mod on /r/infidelity that bans post just at the sheer mention of pronouns she deems unfit. Eg: Female. Until that sub I had no idea that some people consider the word female an insult. I just use it as a synonym for women. 

Same like I call women, birds, chicks, chicas, for the last few decades no one ever took offense. 

Problem is 1 foul moron, who's actually in charge of a pretty serious sub, which is the first sub people go to looking for information and support for infidelity, a VERY serious subject matter, are at the whim of some feminist with the emotional EQ of a 5-year-old and the mannerisms and maturity of a stubborn 19 year old. 

At no point do these people step back and just let the users of these subs get on with what they want. 

And does their policing really help? Well, no one likes to be policed. But if it hits the point where it's no fun anymore, or simply broken, that's when subs lose traction, and when that happens Reddit loses traction."
3779,If you monk till the point you can't talk and interact with people with some sort of self awareness there is no MGTOW group where you don't risk to be kicked out from. MGTOW is not about solipsism.
3780,Seems unfair. How will we tell our banned stories from /r/mgtow2?
3781,"From what I have seen, r/menslib has gone to the opposite extreme- it is all self-hating men and misandry now."
3782,They probably banned everyone posting that stuff which is why it disappeared
3783,[deleted]
3784,"You know a few months ago I said the same thing here. I was afraid mgtow would turn into that. I guess we were right. The sub wasn't like this in when I first joined. Ironically the dudes on that sub forever curse about TwoX doing the same thing but I guess it's ok when they do it. 

Hypocrisy. I can't stand it."
3785,"Yeah its a big dictatorship and a conspiracy. Ugh see what i mean? The things you say you just sound like such a fucking dumb fag, ban hammer was made for people like you"
3786,Now I understand. They don't like female because transgender. Crazy. Want to be women. Right.
3787,"Idk buddy but why did you ban me from r/mgtow?

Do you supposed men not fisticuffs anymore?"
3788,High sex drive whatever. I think you know what I meant
3789,"Yes, we mustn't have anything that could offend your delicate sensibilities."
3790,Never mind you sounded really cool this time just then
3791,She did you a favor.
3792,They're only feminists until the bill arrives.
3793,"Exactly.

You set the frame of your date and stick too it. It’s called setting boundaries.  Long gone are the days where women get a free ride. Remember, you are the prize."
3794,"yeah good job, now move on"
3795,And nothing of value was lost... twice.
3796,"I've had plenty of dates and several LTRs that dropped me when they realized I didn't want kids (I'm always up front, but some think they can change me after an LTR). Women tell me, ""you are selfish for not giving the person you love what they want. You obviously don't love her.""  


It's as if all they want from me is my sperm....  


A few 'strong and independent women' who told me to my face 'its the job of a man to pay for the woman,' and 'if the man isn't paying my bills, he is called a friend and not a boyfriend.'"
3797,">The topic of feminism came up

Oh-oh."
3798,"""I put up this post as the daily reminder of why the MGTOW life is fundamentally necessary in our day and age""

&#x200B;

If you are trying to ""date"" actively I think you are not reminding yourself daily why MGTOW is necessary, it's like a Christian trying to remember Jesus everyday but sinning all the time.

&#x200B;

Or maybe am I the one confused about MGTOW? I thought it was about men leaving the plantation"
3799,Sounds like good communication/dating philosophy to me. It’s also how you filter out non-likeminded people. You dodged an incompatible bullet. Just like with any other dealbreaker.
3800,"Post approved, barely. 

But ""woman does X; means women are bad; posting as a reminder to stay mgtow""  is largely a wasted effort.

It's like going into a physics class with a bunch of grey-haried German physicists and bouncing a ball and saying ""reminding you all of that third law of motion! """
3801,"It's basically still a custom for men to pay on the first date. 

If you want to date, and play that game, then you are basically playing by their rules. Is it fair? No. 

So why bother with it? If you're looking to date and get into a relationship, theres not much helpful analysis or commentary you'll find here."
3802,"Dating or even paying attention to the ""regular"" women in the West is a loser's game nowadays, IMHO... 

P.S. => r/relationships/"
3803,Congrats on avoiding being a foodie call. :)
3804,"You're MGTOW and this surprised you?  
Stop dating or stop posting stories about the obvious."
3805,"Wait until the date to bring it up after you've already ordered and you can really get her going. All serious conversation should be done face to face, not over the phone or texts, in my opinion. Whatever though. It's no big loss. She can't see your ""cocky smile"" that shows your dominance when you're over the phone.

I like lunch buffets.. I'll pay because they're cheap and if they're single mothers, often they can be up for quickies when the kids are at school. I don't have nor want a ""nightlife"" where I'm out in bars until midnight."
3806,"Great work!  


It is always best policy to be up front with your boundaries.  


This way those who disagree overtly can do so and you save a lot of time.  


Those who disagree covertly, i.e. accept up front, but ""change their mind"" later,  
You can always go firmly back you having been already up front with her so you have yourself covered.  


Being up front about boundaries also help against being gas-lighted pretty well, or slowly manipulated."
3807,Women only care about money.  Shocking I know.
3808,First dates should always be dutch. I've offered to pick up the cheque when it's just a coffee but they usually still try and still insist on paying. This is why coffee is a great first date.
3809,"Although you have every right to not pay its totally up to you. And would have agreed if it was another circumstance, but you did ask her out on date. Thus as a gentleman and if you are interested it would have been  nice thing to do. In todays society there is alot of femists but keep in mind not everyone is and I dont think should change the way you approach women. Maybe she did back out because she wanted a free meal or maybe she didnt. Women are wired different than us. Maybe she just took it a little offensive. Either way, you shoot your shot with your women if you cant do an inexpensive meal after you were the one that asked her out. Than maybe you should wait till a girl asks you out. I dont mean anything in a bad way. A single meal wont kill you if its a girl that really interests you."
3810,Why do you still date?
3811,"Most of them just want the free meal anyway. They just don't admit it.

There's a reason some advise to go on a Coffee first date, so you can use it as a cheap filter."
3812,"Damned if you do, and damned if you don't when it comes to dating. I was so much happier with my life when I decided I was not going to play that game anymore."
3813,Bullet dodged indeed!
3814,"In my mid-20's blue pill days, I took her to Taco Bell and *split the bill*.   For no other reason that I was too ignorant to realize it was assumed I should pay, especially for $4.  She told me (much later) she was speechless and couldn't believe I actually did that.  But Red Pillers know what comes next:  I fucked her.  My cluelessness played off like a high value male, and that got all the tingles going."
3815,"I don't understand why guys post here about their flirting with, and trying to date, women.  That's kind of not the point of MGTOW.  They're all a sexual _________ lawsuit waiting to happen."
3816,"Couldn’t agree more. MGTOW is about going *your own* way, not following another guy’s way."
3817,"Well, the ones who agree to Dutch a few times at the start, and then manipulate the simps and cucks to pay for ""their"" new house and taking care of Chad's kids - heavy bullets. But yes, a Dodge is a Dodge. A Dodge it is"
3818,Lol so you pay for her to get the pussy eventually. Hmmm banging a slut would be easier then.
3819,"Have you gotten any dates since, and if so, were there 2nd dates after going Dutch?"
3820,I think they are both shortsighted. I'm a firm believer in my wallet being proportionately open to her legs. A little pre meal fellatio goes a long way to me saying yes to steak and lobster.....
3821,She is okay with a form of prostitution then
3822,Dude if you invite someone else to dinner you should pay for it. Regardless of sex or feminist ideals.
3823,"Fair enough for her to do so. Everyone can hold their own standards.

I don't understand what you're getting at."
3824,"Is this the right sub?

Isn't this about MGTOW?"
3825,Agreed. What especially struck me was how uncompromising and cold-hearted she was about it. Keep in mind we’d invested several hours of our time connecting over the phone. To have her go from 60-0 without even trying to compromise and explain her position showed me where her priorities were.
3826,"Absolutely, fuck her. Women are desperately trying to find a cash cow now, it’s easy to spot and avoid them."
3827,"> Long gone are the days where women get a free ride.

Dude there's a girl I want to school with who makes thousands of dollars a month selling her panties"
3828,This one definitely fell into that last camp. Used a very similar line.
3829,"I should clarify— I generally don’t date. Every now and again, I meet someone who I think might be different, so I tip my toe in the water. And I’m quickly reminded why I don’t date. So I’m reminding myself as much as I am trying to remind others.

That said, MGTOW isn’t a religion with definite commandments and sins. It’s only a principle that men are free to interpret in their own ways."
3830,"Nothing wrong with a MGTOW dating if it's on his terms and the woman is quality. My personal rule is that I never ask a girl out or chase a woman. If she asks me out and puts in the effort, and is my type, I'll consider."
3831,"Highly appreciated. I can’t speak for others, but I’d consider myself fairly MGTOW and I appreciate the reminder so that I don’t fall back to old ways. Still, point taken 👍🏻"
3832,WTF? why are you being downvoted for stating obvious knowledge? Is this a dating advice sub now?
3833,For some reason I still find it shocking how modern women act
3834,"Good comment, but you should know that I suggested drinks only. Then she insisted it be drinks, mini golf, and dinner. All for the first date. She also demanded to go to certain restaurants and mini golf places. Now you might see why I made it clear up front."
3835,[deleted]
3836,Nope. Complete cut of communications
3837,"So when you ask your friend ''lets go and eat something'', do you pay for it ? and does he then automatically think your gonna pay for it ?"
3838,"That's actually a very good point.

But how do you eat casual lunch with someone then? Like, how do you ask if a buddy would like to go for a snack without having to pay?"
3839,"Claims to be a feminist and thus supposedly for equality. When informed she'll be treated equally, she's no longer interested in participating.

Then you: yeah, standards!

Hypocrites, all."
3840,">OP had better pay 100% if he wants to date me  
Those are just her standards, what's your point?

I don't think you're in the right place, bud."
3841,Alll my ex gfs had no splitting the tab. Fair is fair.
3842,"You seem like a smart, reasonable dude.  So many of these men on here think that MGTOW is a club or something and want to put out a news letter and have rules.

Reminds me of the stump fuckers who join motorcycle gangs; they are so individualistic and free that they have to be told what they are allowed to wear and ride and are worth less as an individual then the whole.

You do what you have to do.  If casually dating while you keep your shit together makes you happy (as it does me), then more power to you."
3843,"Ahhh I see. See you didnt post that. If that was the case then I agree with you now. If she got choosey and suggested all that then yea, she is tripping and being pushy all in the first date."
3844,That's my ultimate goal too lol.
3845,With other people since too?
3846,"It's the context. If it's your buddy and you ask ""happy hour at Maloney's?"" Then you go. You dont buy the whole time, but usually ""first round's on me"" is polite enough. And then your buddy will probably buy you a round. 

Coworkers? ""Hey, wanna try that new hipster Dutch baby spot today?"" Well, that's fine because you're both already in the same situation (work), so Dutch yould be expected. 

Wanting a romantic encounter. Well, women are attracted to resources first. That's just how it is. If you're looking for a relationship and you dont play that game, well, you can expect to strike out. 

It's not a game worth playing."
3847,"true. I would expect to pay for myself. However when it is explicitely made clear that its a date like ""let me take you out"", generally that what is expected. I personally don't pay for her because I dont really phraze it like that.
Women equate money to interest, weather or not you are a cheapskate and it generally just bruises there ego. Isnt always a problem but it doesn't help your cause.
The other night I was at a club and I asked these girls if they wanted to dance on the main dance floor and she said she would if I bought her friend a drink. 
I stuck my hand in her face and said i don't pay for women's company, and walked off. lol"
3848,"I agree what you say about feminists.

The thing is she never claimed to be a feminist or anything of the like. She's just some woman with traditional values..."
3849,"Yes he is. 

What isnt in the right place is a post that points out obvious knowledge going back to, well, forever. 

""Women care about money and what you spend on them""  .....  ""this one wouldnt date me if I didnt pay""   .... well. Yeah.  r/asktrp or maybe r/r/purplepilldebate is a better spot for people who want to discuss sating situations from a redpill perspective. Just my opinion."
3850,"But it's normal for women to want to be paid for. Their attraction is heavily based on being taken care of.

I would see the joke, but there isn't one, because the OP appears to be seriously looking for a relationship. This is a game he is choosing to play, he can't complain about it to people who have chosen not to."
3851,"No problem you mean?

Same. I’ve noticed that girls who are actually into me have no problem splitting. They prioritize people over money.  Perish the thought."
3852,"No, I’m not dating. Going monk for now"
3853,Are you sure you're not looking for a PUA forum?
3854,">She's just some woman with traditional values...

Exactly. I keep trying to tell some of y'all that you're gonna mess around and shoot yourselves in the foot because you're pushing away good women with Conservative, traditional values; likely women who have some kind of religious upbringing. Generally, not all, but *generally,* these types of women are anti-feminist and embrace their roles as women which is to be a help -meet to their husbands. I honestly don't know what else to say anymore, because it's not dissimilar from what feminists do to men and then complain about there ""not being any good men left."" Well, it's because all of the ""good men"" you want have traditional values, and your emasculating BS is a complete turn off to them. So, they walk away from or avoid you completely. 

It's the same with MGTOW/red pill men who are still dating for whatever reason. If you try to pull that ""true equality"" mess on a woman with traditional values, she's going to be turned off. That means, you just pushed away a woman that likely believes in submitting to her husband, the man being the head of the household, home cooked meals, washing your drawls, and keeping the marriage bed undefiled and satisfactory, and you being [the king of the castle](https://youtu.be/_e1Hw39C7lE). These women are also usually raised that approaching men is forward and unladylike, so the *only* way you can encounter her is if you do the courting. A woman that is ok with ""going dutch,"" NSA sex, hanging out in bars drinking and carrying on, is likely a feminist! The very type of person a lot of MGTOW men say they're actively trying to avoid. It's like they want a woman with traditional values, but feminist behaviors. It don't work that way, pimpin' lol. You either get a lady with traditional values whom you have to present with equally traditional values or you get a feminist. Those are your options if you choose to date instead of going monk. 

There are a lot of good men and women out there who want to love and connect with someone and start a family. And feminists and MGTOW cats are gonna mess around and push good candidates away because they're trying so hard to ""beat the system"" and prove a point. Once you've gotten to a point where you're actively blocking your own blessings, it is *then* that you've become a slave to the system. I've seen this happen in person. This girl got mad because this guy who was interested in her opened the door for her. This guy's a complete gentleman and a darn good catch. He has very traditional values and will make an excellent husband and father some day. And this heifer had the nerve to get mad because he opened doors for her? She sure didn't get mad when he was paying for her meals and driving up his gas getting her to work every day, though. If I sound irritated, I am, because this is my little brother I'm talking about, and I didn't appreciate the way this girl did him at **all.**

Traditional values don't mix with feminism and MGTOW. So if you want to date and adhere to MGTOW, you're going to be relegated to the feminists you hate, because a woman with traditional values will be put off by you. Period."
3855,"Its not so much a game he's playing as he has a type. Just like you may not want to date a fat girl, he does not want to date a girl who doesnt contribute equally."
3856,"FYI: PUA != MGTOW

You're striking me as a PUA type that flies a MGTOW flag"
3857,Np yea. You are correct. I've had 10s pay insist on paying their way. You stuck to your guns. Respect. I'm the same way. Draw that hard line.
3858,"Just because he isn't completely ignorant to the dating scene doesn't mean he's involving himself in it. 

Did you know that some people go MGTOW as a response from learning red pill theory, opposed to just blindly going along without understanding the social dynamics relating to it?"
3859,"You make a good point, but I think it's too easy to say traditional = good, equality = bad. 

I mean the above is 'probably' true if you want a long term relationship like your brother, but the reverse is true for men who don't want one, and are just interested in the short term right?

And the OP rejected someone for holding traditional values, indicating he just wanted someone for the short term. 

I would argue that short term isn't worth it, especially given the type of people who want equality, as you said. But the same goes for long term. Just because they're traditional, doesn't mean it's a good deal, nor does it mean they're any different from most other women at heart (AWALT). It's up to each individual (who dates) to decide which they want, and if they go for the reverse, what more can they expect than to get hurt.

&#x200B;

I suppose there are also women who take this traditional perspective of wanting to be paid for, and then acting in every way non-conservative. I think that's the reason for the OP to make this thread. He's trying to warn us of women who kinda chameleon traditionalism to exploit mens' wallets?

 

But again, the OP indicated to the woman he wants something short term (equal pay), and she rejected on terms that either (1) she doesn't want short term, or (2) she's chameleoning traditionalism for a free meal.

So, is he warning us of (1) or (2)... well he never found out which one she was, so it's all too likely she's simply traditional. Leaving me to ask, why did he make this thread and why is everyone pretending there is a lesson to be learnt from his story?"
3860,"Men paying for dates ended when women largely entered the workforce in ww1 and ww2. Now, there is no reason for not go half on dates."
3861,"When I said he's playing a game, I was referring to him trying to go on dates with women. All that 'nonsense', it is all just part of what women are, and these things repel MGTOW individuals. 

&#x200B;

But if the OP wants to date that's fine and it's on him. He can want a relationship with someone who pays for themself. But it goes both ways. She can also want someone who pays for her. 

The difference is he wants equality, and she doesn't. But if you want a sustainable relationship, equality is irrelevant, as attraction is asymmetrical. Again, it's up to him but just don't complain about what you're choosing to engage in."
3862,"What did I say that makes you think so, and why? I'm a MGTOW who never dates or anything of the like, nor do I intend to ever in the future.

I'm arguing that the dating scene is asymmetrical for biological reasons, and if people choose to date, this is something that they must accept. Personally, this would be a downside to dating but as a MGTOW, I don't date so idgaf and idk who in this sub would care."
3863,I would even tell her she should be ashamed of herself its 2019!
3864,"Usually when the girl insists on paying for herself, it means she is not interested and has friend-zoned. But I also know of many exceptions where if the man is unemployed/underemployed or they’re college-aged that going Dutch is common practice"
3865,"Man, you make me cringe so hard"
3866,"I was being very general when I said good men/women have traditional values. Obviously, people are individuals and should be judged by their character. I wasn't so much stating that people with traditional values are usually ""good people to be in relationships with"" as I was stating that people who are good candidates for relationships usually have traditional values. Does that make sense?

All in all, I, too, am unsure what the exact message OP is trying to convey, here. To draw parallels with feminists again, it's like complaining that there are men out there who have the ""nerve and audacity"" to expect a woman to be more submissive, feminine, and allow him to lead. It just sounds like a typical situation of encountering someone who doesn't share your values and with whom you're incompatible. That's...*normal.* There's nothing wrong with having traditional values, and if one doesn't want to adhere to traditional values, they have every right to look elsewhere. But there's no reason to ring the proverbial alarm and ""warn"" others that people with traditional values exist. Even if the intent was to imply the ""chameleon theory"" it's still unnecessary. That's like saying, ""Beware of ""smiling faces."" Sometimes people are nice to others just to get what they want out of them."" Naw, really, lol?

>Just because they're traditional, doesn't mean it's a good deal, nor does it mean they're any different from most other women at heart (AWALT). 

That's very true. But it is a good temperature gauge, for sure.

Maybe it's because I'm a socially awkward weirdo, but I'll never understand why so many people who claim to be tired of being generalized by certain groups then proceed to generalize others themselves. Literally every demographic does this ad nauseam; *especially* these past few years. I swear, depending on the subject matter, every online discussion involves some variation of the following:

White people always...

Black people always...

Conservatives always...

Liberals always...

Immigrants always...

[Insert religious group here] always...

Men always...

Women always...

Do you ever think that we'll get to a point in society where we start judging people based upon *who* they are instead of *what* they are? The fact that humans are even managing to coexist anymore with this type of thinking being so widespread is nothing short of a miracle. I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop, because it's like everyone is just sick of everyone now, lol."
3867,Pretty much this.
3868,">Their attraction is heavily based on being taken care of.  
>  
>This is a game he is choosing to play

Hallmarks of pick-up artistry."
3869,Go back to r/MGTOW with that shit.  Nothing said here should make you cringe.
3870,"Uh-huh, that's right. 

Both your posts are aggressive with no argumentative value. 

I'd ask why you're even here but looking at the quality of your speech, I'm scared that you'll call me a poo poo head or something..."
3871,"Honestly, I haven't really noticed much generalising of groups directly. I mean there is a strong media agenda against straight white males in games and movies and all that, but it's a bit specific..

I'm trying to think of what it's most similar to and I just come up with the general dislike of people who are in a different category to yourself, or really just people who have different opinions.

But at the same time, the internet makes it so much easier to avoid it and only speaking to people who hold the same opinions. Take MGTOW for example, even with a heavy social rejection of MGTOW, it's easy to find this sub.

This leads me to the next point, that even within the groups there may be differences in opinion. But a ridiculous proportion of society are ignorant in many ways. They don't look to correct fallacies in their arguments, or find problems with their behaviour to improve. 

What I'm getting to is that most people who dislike people for having different opinions, are also almost always going to confide in their own group, where they will choose to avoid discussions of any disagreements. This provides them with a safe place, so they won't have a strong need to leave their group to attack others (too frequently). For this I don't think there will be any major repercussions on a societal level. 

Having said this, it feels like the topic is too vague for my answer to hold any meaning. but at the same time, I'm thinking that there can't just be a reason for society to crumble, but there must also be a sufficient driving force. Enough people have to respond in a particular way, and I don't see this happening."
3872,"I don't care if it's a hallmark of anything. I'm saying what I think is true.

Maybe try counter my argument opposed to attempting to discredit myself."
3873,"Hahah, speaking about aggressive or post quality..."
3874,"Would it be too much of a stretch for me to suggest that it's all part of a divide and conquer strategy by the elites that will eventually be used as a catalyst to usher in the New World Order (one world government)?

I'll see myself out. -_-"
3875,Not necessary as that's not the issue at hand. I see now that you're a Man Sent His Own Way.
3876,Mgtow has done more for me me than any amount of therapy ever could.
3877,We gotta create our own site or blog cause now this Reddit is just for advertising not thoughts
3878,"While r/MGTOW original was getting a little overzealous, it didn't approach anywhere near the level that the quarantine claims.

And I see that trash like r/FemaleDatingStrategy still exist, so your kinda proving their point."

3880,Same. Good luck out there.
3881,It's illegal to discriminate on the basis of sex so reddit by allowing Female Dating Strategy to ban all men is illegal as reddit is a commercial organisation.
3882,"After being through (my opinion ofcourse) hell because of girls, and a false allegation when i found MGTOW....it was like everything ""clicked""
I wasn't surprised anymore, I realized that is just how they are, and that there is absolutely nothing I can do about it......
So I said fuck it and bought a motorcycle"
3883,"Strength, brother."
3884,"Incels or not, it helped me cope with some hard times. I can say that MGTOW likely saved my life, and at the very least, helped me find something to live for. The main difference between an incel and a MGTOW is attitude, after all. 

As a middle-aged lifelong feminist, the RPR nearly destroyed me. Having a place to just vent like mad, even if it was kinda a craphole, was extremely beneficial. Sometimes a person really does just need to bitch about things, before they can move on. It supplied that. 

It honestly reminded me of some of the trauma-recovery forums that I used to frequent."
3885,Funny how MGTOW is gone but female dating strategy is alive and well
3886,">lots of angry incels

You got that right."

3890,"It is odd (and actually sad) that you have to learn that it is OK to not get married and have a family. 

I have always dreaded having to do that, but figured it was what everyone did and if not you are a failure. It was such a immense feeling of relief when I realized a few years ago, that No, I don’t have to do any of that. Fuck what society says."
3891,"Nah, I was just saying thanks. I think it’s unacceptable bullshit that anything male gets quarantined and the subs such as u named don’t have to succumb to that standard. 

I saw some red pill rage on OG but very few actually disturbing things.  Men do not poses a space anywhere including reddit to vent . 

Too many ppl join subs to troll, or get all righteous like some ahem unmentioned offshoots of OG and they complain and cause trouble to either have it removed or molded in the image they deem it to be . 

So in finale another thanks to all the dudes that commented, posted , and made me laugh, keep perspective on what I was going through and everything else.

Love ya all brother ✌️"
3892,I agree. It’s only going to make people more vocal. It’s not about the Mgtow title. It’s about men learning to respect themselves again.
