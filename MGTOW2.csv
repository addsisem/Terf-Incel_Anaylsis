9,ThePanther1989,"Just add a weight room, a walk in humidor, a cellar, and I am set. Keep in mind, if I let a woman move in...those three things would be gone; at the very least, she would demand that I get rid of my weights and the walk in humidor, and try to have her gaggle of girlfriends over constantly to raid the cellar and drink me dry! Trust me, if you move a woman in..she will try it..your peaceful home will be a distant memory! Your life and your peace of mind above any woman! Go your own way!"

25,Sarm11111,"Once i kept my main room/living room nicely decorated by a buddy wife.  I had kept it up and put all my man things in the basement, like a big screen, my desk, pc ,,you get it.  And I’ll admit it  was to have an area that I could entertain women.  Over time and a few shitty relationships I  started asking myself the tough questions and first was do I really want a women moving in or marriage for that.  I have always had a very low trust factor for women. And without going into it the lack of trust stemmed from some very criminal things by women, that no one would believe.  I wasn’t an INCEL, far from it, but after the “experience” I retreated and stopped dating.  And witnessed other warning signs with friends and coworkers .  So I asked those questions, do I really want to have a wife/women in my life to the extent of bring them home or marrying, and the answer was no, hell no.  So I bought a huge screen, cut a hole in the dinning room table to mount a tv in to play games with friends, decorated my walls with dragon heads, swords , and so on.  So now my man cave is my whole house and I vouknr care less what any women would say, because I’ll probably be pushing them out the door to a cab.and I love my childish dungeon."

76,jenovajunkie,"That's where men fail each other. They don't support each other the same way that women (feminists) do. It's always a man taking upon the entire burden while women know how to tap into their available support systems.

Whatever, maybe your father is a fucking tard and he deserves what happened, then if so, why the fuck would you call it divorce rape? It's as if you are excusing the horrible act of divorce rape and just shrugging your shoulders, like as if to say ""whatever, wasn't me who got screwed over, thus the system works""."

Another example, I've given male friends the possibility to ""earn"" some alms by selling some of my stuff online ""on commission"".  He earned it and did something useful for me."
79,jenovajunkie,"Employing your friend is not the type of support I mean, I would think ""employing your friend"" isn't quite the same either.

I'm a bit confused, how men know that divorce and marriage has the potential to screw over a man, why don't men stick together more like how feminists do. That kind of support, that's what I'm getting at."
80,unblackmailable,"I know you are, we're all on this subreddit with the best of intentions.  I get it.

89,LetsGoAllTheWhey,"Just read a post on /r/askreddit asking what is the most appropriate way to compliment a woman.  The answers, in summary, were that the sentences had to be structured a certain way (ex. compliment her choices such as what she's wearing, not how it makes her look). The compliment should be delivered in a certain tone of voice, given at the appropriate time. etc etc etc.  It's far, far more trouble than it's worth.  

Why jump through all those hoops in an attempt to be nice?  It's so much less trouble and stress to just ignore them and walk away.  I'm so glad I did."

Why do we think they have labeled all MRAs misogynist, all MGTOW as incels and pedophiles? Why did they try to ban the ""Red Pill"" documentary? 

&#x200B;

Show of hands kids, who has the answer? 

&#x200B;

Feminism exist today only as a function of censorship, and that is exactly why they try to paint you guys with that brush, to silence you and redirect from your argument.

&#x200B;

Look, I'm an MRA, but not MGTOW. I'm married, long term (I found a great one from a previous generation- well I may be MGTOW because I did go my own way), but the message is as clear as if it were a written like a flash burnt across the sky, and the only way it can be defended is by calling you ""misogynist"" or some other vile name so as to dismiss you and silence the conversation, keep people from looking up.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately there are too many women out there starting to agree, and as Dr. Smith stated, ""if men are not allowed to speak, I will speak for them"". I had a phone conversation recently with one of the most notable women in the MRM, and even she replied to my comment that ""I don't subscribe to women bashing"" with, ""well, society and women have a lot to account for"".  

&#x200B;

Feminism is quickly becoming a joke, a cliche', fodder for parody...and this issue is exactly why. The guys comment was fucking brilliant."
100,30203forever,"And by ""family courts"" you mean the ""Divorce tribunals""? Because they're neither ""family"" nor ""courts"", IMHO...."
101,30203forever,"I agree with what you wrote. Personally, I define feminism as the political movement of the sub-par females to leverage their vote in order to get their hands on the resources which they ""deserve"" but are not able or unwilling to get the traditional way (i.e. scamming the males out of their money under the current gynocentric laws). And they're using their phony ""victimhood"" because it helps greatly with that. The ""equality"" which the feminists are constantly harping about is actually the ""equality of outcome"" along the lines of: ""that woman was able to secure a good husband &/or job and  I was not; therefore, it's obvious that the patriarchy is oppressing me and I deserve to be compensated by society for being persecuted."" That's how the feminists really think and that's the very reason why you never argue with them: it's next to impossible to make someone understand something when their income depends on NOT understanding it. IMHO, the equality of outcome (i.e. communism) is not equality at all and I'm talking from personal experience, actually. As Aristotle said 2.5K years ago, ""The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal."" The feminism is evil in its most basic form and must be fought with everything we'we got because if it wins, the men will become the abject slaves, no doubt about it...."

104,DJ-Roukan,"That was pretty brilliant, guy."
105,WildChad,"I have come to the exact same end conclusion that feminism, the way it trends, leads to re-introduction of slavery as it ultimately desires to have the power to arbitrarily call any sexual act a criminal offense whenever it wants - Only dictators are in the same position as the power they have is to command the hand of the law according to their will - In its completion this would reduce men to a slave class while women would be elevated to noble citizenry / master class, just like Ancient Greece and Rome had a slave class of sub-humans who were there to do all the work that could be exploited in any way on the whim of the master class citizens.  


This is the end game agenda, even if not conscious one, of feminism.  
In other words, even if well intended, this is the automatic final state if feminism does not meet enough resistance."
106,DJ-Roukan,"You are not alone my friend. Most people have not heard a great many truths about feminism...because they have become so adept at the lie, have so much power, they can not only censor the movie, but the very fact that they did censor it.  They censor the truth, then they hide the truth, then they hide the fact that they hid the truth.

&#x200B;

Most people that I speak with on line, that still believe that feminism is about equality and not a hate group aimed at men, are so naive of the truth, have so little understanding, that it would take ten posts to bring them up to speed.

107,30203forever,I agree with that too ;)
108,30203forever,"Yep. The end goal is to enslave the hated bottom 80% ""below average undesirable"" men while using the top 20% as their playthings. I can picture a group of the landwhales lying lazily around a picnic table, picking on some grapes & cheese, washing them down with gallons of wine while bitching bitterly that ""You can't get an honest day's work out of those slaves anymore..."" The truth of the matter is that no less than 80% of all women (probably over 90%) would support such a system wholeheartedly..."

111,WildChad,"Indeed as almost nobody is able to resist having absolute power over other people on moral basis alone.  


I just wrote a separate post illustrating the dangers of this inspired by this conversation and another one I had yesterday:  


[https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW2/comments/cget6a/the\_end\_state\_of\_feminism\_a\_female\_master\_class/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW2/comments/cget6a/the_end_state_of_feminism_a_female_master_class/)"
112,DJ-Roukan,You bet. Glad to help.
113,30203forever,">Maybe the femanuts try doing one of their ""studies"" on male Humor.

Not going to work because stupid people do not usually understand humor and hate the people who do (usually, the men). That's because the feminists are not only devoid of the sense of humor themselves, jealous of others who have it but are also very suspicious & fearful that people are joking at their expense (which is not entirely untrue...). As far as ""get a life"" goes, that's the core of the issue: they are feminists precisely because they can't get a life and NOT the other way around...."
114,30203forever,"I saw that post an agree with that. In addition, the females want the right to reinterpret consent post-factum and sometimes years or decades after the fact. Case in point: the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. Not only that, they want their claims to be judged to be ""true till proven false"" and not the other way around (i.e. #BelieveAllWomen). In short they want the end of the Due Process but only in one direction because ""reasons"". I have a simple solution to all that mindfuckery, at least on the personal level. Do not engage with any ""regular"" women in the West. Avoid them like the plague they are. To me, they are all the property of the state, their real daddy-husband and I do not mess with the government property.... P.S. You're ""better"" than me because I reported, blocked that person & forgot about it..."
115,DJ-Roukan,"and you are getting smarter every time I read you...

kidding of course, but dead on the money accurate."
116,WildChad,"Oh yeah, I didn't even remember post-factum which is horrible.

In the worst case not only you'd need to record all your sex acts with women, you'd have to store them forever - And when it comes to the current practices of divorce courts, evidence for the man is often completely ignored by the judge - So practically you'd never be safe even with consent.

I think you are completely right about ending Due Process, which is currently in the process of being eroded for women just because vagina.

And yes, avoid all BP women in the West and gauge actively for these belief systems in any women you engage with in order to stay safe."

If you have a phone with a front facing camera it can see you every time you use the phone. It's too late to escape this now. Your face is on record and it will be abused."
161,HurtinSteve,Some day he will have an opportunity that is dashed because he posted in a mgtow group and now he is branded as a hater.
162,AbominableSnowDog,"Heck yeah dude! You're who you choose to be. This sub is for men who realise the hypocrisy in women and build their own future. Not misogyny.

Those trashtalkers not only missed the agenda of this sub but are assholes for criticising you like that."
163,NakedValhallaBoyyy,"I was a bit surprised just how upset they got over that sort of thing. I understand why they got upset, but I thought they'd at least fight that instinct with the whole going your own way bit. Not everyone who breaks away from the norm and goes their own way is going to go away they feel is preferred.

You don't need to embrace femininity though. We live in a time that people say you need to accept who you are as if that is unchangeable. I tried to just embrace it when I was a feminist and one day I looked at myself and felt like I was a caricature, that 'leaning into it' was just as much an act as trying to hide it.

There is a similar movement that says we need to accept our bodies as they are, but that isn't true. There are certain parts of you that you shouldn't try to force a change on, aspects that deal with your emotional well being and your happiness. But the way you pose, the way you speak, the words you use, how you dress, those are easily  changed things and more than one path can make you happy. These aren't 'who you are'.  These are just the cosmetics of behavior, things that can be easily changed to suit who you want to become."

165,Folwart,"Do you have a specific goal for college? If you don't, make sure you have one before you go otherwise the probability of it being a waste increases exponentially. Depending on your skill set and preferences, the trades are a good option. Honestly, outside of the STEM fields I wouldn't recommend a degree."

175,whotfleap,I never said anything about disliking you. You're just reminding me of every other snowflake I see on the internet. Yeah he might have some feminine qualities but nobody is being homophobic to him. People toss phobias around to freely.
176,GremlinDotKill,"We are talking about the pose, the bleached hair, the wrist flick, you are just looking to be relevant."
177,asianduckpinoydog,No joke. You don't criticise someone who is afraid of snakes as being less than human...why do people discriminate against people who have a natural aversion to homosexuality? But I can't criticize you because perhaps you are naturally homophobephobic or more likely heterophobic...I understand you

179,ThereIsAlwaysVanilla,"Then you are set. Make and save loot at Dominoe's and live cheap while you pursue your goals. In your postition, I'd choose music because you can put it out online for practically free and maybe you'll get a following. Music is practically post-scarcity nowadays. 

Acting might be tougher. That's still a gatekeeper industry and you'll have to try to break into ivory towers and whatnot. As for music, no one can silence you with the tools you have at your disposal today. Keep on rockin' in the clown world!"

182,haagendaas,"Agreed, my bad for tossing the “homophobia” thing around. I guess I’m just being influenced and now it happens every now and again. Sorry, I didn’t mean my original comment."
183,haagendaas,"That I am, nice catch. But honestly, he didn’t look too bad."
184,haagendaas,"Because there’s a clear difference between homosexuality and snakes. 1. Homosexuals are the same species as you. 2. Homosexuality does not bite you. 3. I’m not saying you’re less than human, but your morals are iffy at best. 4. I’m neither “homophobephobic” nor heterophobic. Your flaw in this argument is that you can choose to be homophobic, but I cannot chose whether to be homosexual or not."
185,NakedValhallaBoyyy,What? you think that their future employers are going to back track your IP address to the one you had years ago and go through your entire internet history focusing on reddit but not your porn?

I was the only one who responded with civility. Soon after we're both banned. This sub is much nicer anyway, I was getting tired of the memes."
195,MadPreacher1AD,Nicely done bud on the mega-thread. I support this idea to keep the posts about being banned from the cess pool that is MGTOW1.
196,Motorola_Nova,"Agreed.

Does being banned from r/MGTOW stop you from seeing all posts on there or does it just mean that you can't submit your own posts?"
197,GlobalAsshat,They seem to be banning constructive posts and encouraging the women hatred.   It does a disservice to men to be not exposed to material to help them get over their red pill rage.
198,BumKnickle,"MGTOW1 is a fucking joke, the mod team are such a bunch of idiots and they also are doing eveything they can to turn it into an echo chamber, and as we all know the instant you do that you collapse on the inside because you no longer have the ability to justify and reason your opinion.

MGTOW1 is Cancer."
199,kapatikora,"Banned for stating blatantly that mgtow should pursue interest unrelated to women 

Who the fuck woulda thought "
200,Cryedra,I got banned for saying leaving someone elses child to rot is immoral.
201,Trek13,"got banned from r/mgtow twice.  Both times for criticizing  ""dear Leader"" (fucking Trump) in response to idiotic posts praising him.  Politics should be on the sidebar as not allowed and I mostly could ignore the Freeper types on that sub but over time the stupidity just got under my skin.   Also, too many ""victims"" there.  Pretty sure I pissed some people off pointing that out.  Sure, things are somewhat stacked against men in our society, especially white men right now, but if you stand back and objectively look at things it is mostly background noise.   I will take being a white male in this society any day, we are NOT oppressed and if you have half a brain it is not hard to compete and succeed.   Thank god I am not saddled from birth with the crutch of ""victimhood"" like women and other groups are.

And I can say as far as ""MGTOW"" as a concept, probably 90+% of of guys on r/mgtow are just not there.   It seems more of an AA for men in pain dealing with redpill truths.    I wish them goodluck in their pursuit of ""mgtow"", its not for everyone thats for sure.   But FFS keep the reich wing political BS out of it. 

 I say this as a 60 year old, never married, no kids, original ""confirmed bachelor"", retired early, financially independent ""loner"".    Lots of women in my past but could never let go of my freedom."
202,chrisdidwht,I got banned 6 months ago. My last post got over a thousand upvotes. I asked the mod why i was banned. He just mocked me. From what i observed they spend all their time trashing women. Thats not mgtow to me.
203,,Banned from the he man woman haters club for calling them a bunch of whiney bitches with no internal fortitude equating the MGTOW to  cancerous feminist.
204,arealchillbrownie,"So, I just got banned from mgtow1 and I gotta say it's hilarious. I pointed out the difference between incels and mgtow and within 2 min got banned. So like any rational person I messaged the mods for an explanation. Naturally, radio silence ensued. I used to love that sub, it's sad to see it become so pathetic"
205,gopher_glitz,Got banned for saying a comic about transgenders seemed to have little to do with mgtow.  So fucking sensitive.
206,RhizonXXVII,"Not banned yet, but the negativity about women has gotten completely out of control. I saw a post about sex dolls and artificial wombs, upvoted to high heavens, and I am afraid it is a space that is just too focused on getting back at women. Always delving into all the negative sides of feminine nature as if there is NOTHING inherently good or beneficial from it. It's too much. I mean I want to protect myself, but I do not have to actively assume every woman is the spawn of... you get my point...."
207,-Ecliptic-,"> Did you just get banned from /r/MGTOW?

Why yes I did...I've never seen a more pathetic group than that.  Guess they need their safe space."
208,,"I left voluntarily. Too many self-defeatist foreveraloners that are not interested in self development. Not interested in sharing life strategies. Too eager to fall for the clickbait media. I've also been guilty of this in the past. It's very easy to get into the bitter loop concerning feminists. But brandishing all women as having the same agenda is just as stupid as a libtard saying all men are toxic. It serves no purpose. It brings nothing to the quality of your life. MGTOW subreddit in its current state is an echo chamber.

I've seen a conversion from when the incel subreddit got banned. Most of the MGTOWs who shared their wisdom are no longer on the subreddit. A MGTOW I met in London even calls them menimists and refuses to go back on there. A few good posters remain. But they are drowned out by the overwhelming outrage porn.

It's a sinking ship. And that's because visiting the subreddit leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. A hyper focus on the worst of female nature. The worst of society.

Men need male spaces though. Men need brotherhood. Is this subreddit got the markings to provide that? I'm not entirely sure at the moment. However, for me it's time to turn a new leaf. Get back to the original intention of MGTOW. It wasn't to shun yourself away from society. It was to avoid commitment aka marriage and anything that does not serve men on his path. It was to place your hobbies and interests at the forefront. To realise that you're more than just your biological imperative. And I kind of deviate here from most MGTOWs, I don't think hooking up with women is bad if you are smart about it. Essentially the first inception of MGTOWs were the single bachelor types. I think through MGTOW subreddit getting popular. With YouTubers echoing clickbait  like TFM reading out the horror stories of gynocentrism it's become a bastardised version of itself.

Anyways, just my thoughts."
209,,"They'll ban you if they think you're the Chad type.

So much inexperience with those guys on there, as a 34 year old who has been through a lot with women, they became pretty transparent.  Got easy to tell who hadn't been with a girl and who had. "
210,HesperianDragon,Banned in the middle of the night while I slept. Can't think of what made them do this.
211,saaralgris,"Just got banned yesterday, not sure what I said that was so triggering. Never thought I'd say it but that sub is teeming with negativity, it's off my radar moving forward. "

> Society just needs to stop pretending single moms are heroines or some sort of bullshit superwomen.

> Women are extremely superficial herd animals.  Bring shame back and they'll be back in line.

> What about men who have cheated and left women, or widowers

Only comment there. Got banned within minutes"
213,whyamiotaku565,Oh you mean mgtow who are open-minded and not anrgy red pilled divorcées 
214,mcsimeon,I got downvoted to hell just for questioning why they would actively avoid women 24/7. Seems a bit like the old Braincells subreddit. 
215,Liquid_Leopard,"Well, I always wondered what you had to get banned from /MGTOW and I found out! Apparently, well thought out answers and trying to have an adult conversation with mildly differing opinions is all it takes. "
216,yermanbob,"Just unsubbed at the same time as getting banned, apparently you can't ask why an idiot 20 year old got banned, I started to talk about the purity spiral and the creation of there own bubble vs free speech that I've seen kill many communities since athieism+

I predicted that sub will be going down within 18 months because they have lost focus on the welfare of men instead preferring to have a bitch fest at women. "
217,xpillx,"I just got banned from mgtow lol. They turned into a fucking hatred incel group. The amount of man jumping on high horse and virtue signaling there is astounding. I dont know a reason why I got banned. I had many good convos there but I guess ban was for 1 comment in thread where guy was virtue signaling to others about not wanting to fuck that chick he posted that actually looked amazing to me. I suggested that he hates looks too much and maybe he likes a dick in a butt. These guys turn into sjw feminazi that try to control freedom of speech. I dunno maybe they will make safety rooms for those incels soon too. There is a difference in not liking some women behavior and just her looks...
"
218,ArtDeve,I am relieved I finally got banned. /r/MGTOW is full of toxic and hypocritical incels.
219,NYLON_G,"I challenged a so called MGTOW on his slut shaming of an Asian female. I asked the question why he was so concerned about something he had no choice over and no control over.

His response was to launch into a personal tirade about doing whatever he wanted to do. He then attacked me personally and to top it off resorted to racial attacks. This from a MGTOW who has never met me and doesn't know anything about me.

I am convinced that r/MGTOW has been feminised and corrupted by feminists and anti-MGTOW shills. To be banned from the subreddit for having a discussion about MGTOW while the racist idiot sits in there doesn't surprise me. The fact that a text if admin would take sides with a racist does surprise me.

Race has nothing to do with MGTOW. However on racist Reddit subredfits this is not only permissible. It is supported and it is promoted. I will not be going back into that subreddit even as a lurker. It has become a hive of scum and villainy."
220,TimJohnsonIII,Got banned. No explanation. No reply when I questioned.
221,,"Yes. I did. I've also been banned from r/IncelTears and r/TrueFemcels. I was going to give r/feminism a shot, but I absolutely refuse to visit that sub under any circumstances. 

You either hate the targeted gender of those subs or get out. Reason and neutrality are not welcome. 

Honestly, I'm convinced incels have taken over r/MGTOW. They're just so hateful and miserable over there. It's depressing. Do you know not one of those men have posted anything to honor Father's Day? They're so busy hating women they forgot to show all the dads out there love today.

HAPPY FATHER'S DAY TO ALL OF THE GOOD FATHERS OUT THERE!

I didn't have mine, so I admire those who love and care for their children."
222,Oldschool085,"I got banned for jokingly saying ""who hurt you"". "
223,Milk_moustache,"Haha brilliant. I was banned for saying they over implied a negative relationship from a single photo. A man sat on a train with a bit of a somber look, that’s just the London look mate. 

These boys are salty "
224,delukard,"That sub is infested with looser that got cucked and now are crying.

99% of them are beta."
225,Bastard-of-the-North,Got banned for telling someone who questioned why the whole sub was hating on captain marvel that the sub is basically incels 2.0 and referring him here

227,DJDickJob,"If you haven't already been banned, just leave anyway. Fuck that sub. It belongs to the incels now. "
228,TheMasp,got banned  from posting because i asked why we have to be so angry/hating of women lol. I mean i know we are different and MGTOW/Redpill is about that. But we should i feel be working more for Mens benifit and our growth then venting and angry with women.
229,,What’s happening with the ppl being banned so much? Who’s running the MGTOW? It seems the ppl who are being banned are more MGTOW than not. I was just banned yesterday for no good reason
230,13Heathens,"Apparently, this warranted a ban:
  
""True love exists, but it's super rare in our generation.

I know these older couple, pretty well off and retired at about 50? The dude fell sick and was hospitalized, they had the option to discontinue treatment as it seemed hopeless (and was expensive as hell). I would've pulled the plug tbh but the lady did everything she could to treat him; risking their retirement plans.

Thankfully, he didn't have to go through the full course of expensive treatments and they're now enjoy their golden years.

I found out that they were each other's firsts and both worked hard together to earn their wealth. Guy's not a chad too.""
  
Some guy responded with ""Go. Away.""
  
""Not sure why you're so hostile. If you disagree with me, we can have a proper discussion.

Think of it this way.

Getting a unicorn is like winning a lottery. It's so rare that you might as well treat it as non-existent.

But are there lottery winners? Yes.

Should I spend a lot of resources in trying to win the lottery? No.

But the fact remains that there are lottery winners.""
  
Same guy responded with ""Wrong.""
  
I reported the last one for low effort and got the banned message shortly."

The mods are probably 40yo, red-haired women who have hit the wall and chain smoke cigarettes inside their apartments while watching reruns of desperate housewives."
233,,This guy was saying OP’s dead brother (who had committed suicide) was a failure so I called him out and got banned when he told me to fuck off and I replied that he should fuck his anime pillow. Is MGTOW full of furries and anime queers?
234,sikki_nixx,Lol I said MGTOW2 is a fantastic subreddit and got banned from MGTOW...lol
235,lordlahmacun,"I wasn't banned. I left myself. r/MGTOW sadly turned away from a supportive group for men who don't want commitments into a nightmare fuel of incels and alike. I am so disgusted with myself for actually falling for their misogynistic trap for months... 

Well, i guess that's just another dialectic. My life prior to MGTOW was antithesis and MGTOW was thesis. Now it's time for synthesis."
236,TigPlaze,A friend from MGTOW PMed me about having just gotten banned.  They gave him no reason why.  I made a post asking how someone can contest a ban in the event of a mistake.  My post vanished immediately.  This makes me think they have no interest in running MGTOW with integrity.  I invited him here to MGTOW2.
237,Implausible-asset,"Yes I got banned from r/mgtow for ""concern trolling"" on my old account. Nearly all the karma I had was from upvotes in that sub, but they banned me anyways. 

Yeah sorry no sorry, but when someone is complaining about not getting laid and is saying they're going to buy a gun and let fate decide, then yeah I'd say concern is warranted. 

I'm hopeful that here I can see the good posts on how mgtow helps men be better at being themselves, keeps them out of the trap of the marriage contract, and provides cautionary tales based on our own learning experiences with women. 

And mods for inevitable showing of the incels here, please hand out the bans like candy. Those fools are subreddit cancer."
238,Tsukikoselenia,"Been banned because.. I have absolutely no idea, honestly. Not even incel-bashing, defending women, or anything like that (it really isn't my type), just a sudden ban out of nowhere, maybe because of a talk with a guy about how improvement is important but saying that hard work will always work is false, since this guy's posts got deleted? Who knows. 

For a sub that wants to reach the 100k ans is so proud of it, randomly banning people doesn't exactly sound like a smart idea."

I respond that obviously he hasn't moved on if he made a 8 paragraph story about the entire thing.

&#x200B;

Shows you everything you need to know about them. Those aren't true MGTOW and if they are that cowardly on the internet, you have to wonder how bad they are in real life. That's also why that subreddit attracts the lowest quality posters, who mostly seem to want to brag that they have money and women chase them now, which is ridiculous. If you want to attract women that's the opposite of MGTOW."
255,A_G_H_D,"Just got banned for trying to talk about what users think the MGTOW subreddit should be for. I guess that comes under the heading of ""concern trolling""? IDK. IDC. What I do know is , r/MGTOW is definitely not the place to talk about it."

257,Sly21C,"I was banned, no reason given whatsoever. What's going on? I've been a brilliant participant AFAIK. Oh wait, except for one comment where I said I'm not a fan of TRP at all, that I thought MGTOW was better. "
258,russpav,"This is the comment that got me banned 2 months ago. When they banned me I realized they did me a favor. 

“I’m glad others are seeing this trend and speaking up as well. I first subscribed to MGTOW because there were good articles about self improvement and building better habits. The trend seems more and more externally focused and less and less about self improvement.

Repressing others (individuals or groups) does not free my mind, it traps it in a negative feedback loop of anger, fear and resentment. All of which I want to let go of and put down.”"

265,purge1,"Just happened to me, honestly I just thought to look up MGTOW on reddit and found out the MGTOW sub is filled with women hating incels. The thread was the guy talking on Facebook with a girl about that the dogs are better than women, because dog won't divorce you and dog won't take your kids, and asked her what is the womens argument and she said vagina, he was like ""mhm, ok, what else?"". And one of responses there was ""vaginas stink anywhere, I don't need your disgusting hole"" or something, so I responded ""is this sub just riddled with incels?"" And they proved me right, by banning me. Is that really what MGTOW is about?"
266,,Got banned and 12 hours without a reply as to why I was banned. My post was about my concern about MGTOW community that I've heard from the YouTuber Angry MGTOW. Apparently angry incels got ahold of being mods there.

274,choosey-lover,"Just got banned! MGTOW saved my life and set me on the self actualization path 5.5 years ago. I deleted my reddit because I was addicted and now 2 years of lurking has me making an account again because: I finally came out to myself as bisexual after 13 years of living in denial. I reckon they banned me based solely on my other subreddits. I even asked for clarification and got no reply!  hahaha

I think [mgtow.com](https://mgtow.com) is compromised too.

The moderators are not replying to my reply to their 'ban message' (although they said ""reply to this message to get an explanation for your ban"") ... so, it appears the mods on r/MGTOW are not doing their job in a timely fashion, or they are corrupt.

Now almost all of that helpful knowledge and sound advice is being clouded by articles and rants that reflect misogyny, and at times, pure black pilled hatred. 

I understand that a lot of us come to this sub with red pill rage and need that outlet, but that rage will be the very death of this sub. Downvote this into oblivion for all I care, but I know there are men here who feel the same, if they haven’t already moved on.

My comment:

[Just out of curiosity, can’t this be applied to males as well? A lot of my mates are pretty promiscuous dudes and have had plenty of one night stands. So with this logic, are they no different from the women this excerpt aims to shame? 

Not trying to ruffle feathers, just kinda curious on the stance about men that do the things MGTOW hate about women (cheating, sleeping around, using another person for any kind of temporary/ personal gain, etc.). I try not to keep dudes like that in my friend circle anymore,  I can certainly say I’ve seen a lot of men do these things that women are so demonized for.  I’ve certainly been fucked over by the opposite sex, but a lot of my mates have done the same to some genuinely nice women. 

As a single male, I wonder about the MGTOW movement and if it is too extreme of an ideology for me. Don’t mind the GMOW part, since that is the life I tend to lean towards as an introvert, but I love my mother, and sisters, and have met genuinely kind women.]


Hopefully some of you in this sub can answer this without me being banned first. I’m looking for camaraderie with people who aren’t so relationship focused and driven by the need for someone else in their life to make them happy, but MGTOW might be too extreme or me."

333,Memekip,"Yep 

I'm all for male independence, but I feel that constantly going around in a circlejerk of hating women just proves that the people who hang out there are clearly not over it. Being one sided and keeping an eye out for only bad women which fit the narritive in your head is just asking to get into a toxic mindset imo: vicareously playing the victim of a minority of women who play the victim to take advantage of men

It's a subreddit about independent men that discusses women 90% of the time. Which is kind of the opposite of the sub's title"

Well idk, either because I’m a chick or because I genuinely was trying to understand their logic- or both.. probably both.

I had pointed out that I was gaslighted by my ex boyfriend and somehow found myself at 19 years old paying all the rent, all the groceries, and meanwhile my ex boyfriend five years older than me- lying, cheating, and spending his money on a new bong or Xanax addiction- I was trying to point out that it wasn’t because he’s a man that he’s a shitty manipulative person.. 

I’m all for men feeling empowered without women.. but I found myself at mgtow because just like with “man haters”, neither gender should be held accountable for the world’s problems, or an individual’s problems.. and I was wondering what kind of logic they use since it does seem they blame women for all the world’s problems. 

I’d argue a lot of women’s problems are culturally pushed on women by other women, and same with men. 

And also, I have more male friends than female friends... like the two genders aren’t strictly romance based... but mgtow makes it out to be just a biological reproductive thing between the genders.. platonic relationships are important."

I’m all for doing what you want but surely using tinder is the exact opposite of what that sub is all about. Certainly was when I first found it.

No reply from the mods, so I’ve decided I am going to keep messaging them until I get a response. I don’t want back in, if anything this is a blessing, but just want an explanation.

What I am trying to say is a lot of these issues are to do with partners not matching ( ugly or ugly etc) and the capitalist system which is destroying the environmental and sociological spheres of life. We need to truly look at what we NEED in life not what we want. Because right now basic needs are not being met by 60% of the population.

370,redditicantrecall,"Yea I've been banned, dunno why but I asked u/ThatCard though I called out on their paranoia.

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/b7wbur/the\_blackpill\_is\_not\_good/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/b7wbur/the_blackpill_is_not_good/) "
371,In_This_Here_Economy,"MGTOW went to shit for the exact same reason feminism did: the reactionary, fringe elements have become the leading voices of the movement.  I don't share the beef with feminism that a lot of MGTOW men believe that they have to have.  I know and understand that feminism, at it's core, is just as much about dismantling gender roles for men as it is women.  If I am to be honest, it was actual feminism that taught me self respect as a man and why I was compelled to a lot of the behaviors and concepts of myself, women and the world that I had, and that reason is patriarchy.  The same men who brag about how it's been primarily men who've created civilizations and governments are the same ones who deny the existence of patriarchy unironically and under the spell of cognitive dissonance.

It's ridiculous, actually.  

The most important thing, I think, for a man to remember is that he doesn't have to hate women to recognize and respect himself as a human being, and he doesn't have to hate himself to recognize and respect the humanity of women."
372,throwawayapparently9,"the real problem is not the act of ""getting banned."" 
you could always use throwaway accounts to get back there and I'm fine with it.
but the real probelm is that you ""can NOT contact them""! 
it doesn't matter how hard you try or if ""one of the old guys"" you were there, they will never respond you back, NEVER. 
I've been banned from dozens of subreddits, especially LGBTs, feminists, cuckoldery fetishists, adulteries, affair advices, cheating experiences, and I'm cool with getting banned from there, because they are my ""enemy"" territory, getting banned from there is EXPECTED. 
but when i got banned from mgtow? hell no, i wasn't expecting that. i was a men's right activist and a mgtow commentator at the time, and i always considered manosphere my FRIENDLY territory (except PUA and Incels, we don't share much in common) but i never expected a BAN from mgtow. 
the problem is, they won't tell you WHY they banned you and they'll never give you a SECOND chance ever again.
so if the moderators don't want to give a fuck about banned members, why should banned members give a fuck about them? 
and again, they're NOT the OFFICIAL mgtow, as they have confessed it themselves in subreddit. 

but after that, i can't trust any FRIENDLY territory anymore. 

I'm always expecting getting banned from MRA and MGTOW_2 now and i could never trust any territories anymore but i expect a little decency from moderators to respect me and tell me why i got banned and how i can get unbanned."
373,,I got banned because I mentioned I was a female who couldn't cook and why I couldn't (that was the topic of the post...).
374,SUEDE2BLACK,I got banned for posting comments from a feminist site and making satire.They could have warned me not out rite ban I was on there 2 years owell.
375,White_Mlungu_Capital,"Seems like those cucks are banning everyone, screw em."
376,ElMatador_33,Banned for being a sarcastic jerk. Most of those simps are just as bad as all the SJW and feminists they criticize. Their feelings get hurt so easily.
377,38yearsoffreefallin,Ah yes I see what you’re saying now.
378,scifiburrito,someone said MGTOW is for the enlightened people or something like that (i’ll find the link later) and i think i got banned for calling that out. i’ll add an edit later.
379,Shnook82,"Banned yesterday, no explanation after a few messages, just like everyone else it seems."
380,rocko2002,"I got banned after putting a funny meme. 10 minutes later, POOF! This is actually a new account. I might resubscribe to them but I'm not posting anything."
381,ultrasoft70motru,I got banned for calling someone an entitled misogynistic toxic masculinity rapist without using /s because /r/Mgtow doesn’t have /r/braincels.

384,rw032697,I got banned yesterday replying to a comment discussing how not everyone agrees with all posts on MGTOW and I commented that some can be downright sexist/misogynistic. 
385,aki-96,"I Just found MGTOW and got banned the same day. 

I went on there and found bunch of people complaining about women. Some of it seemed valid so I made a post asking what kind of women they find to be acceptable.

My mistake was I wrote I'm a 22F...
 2 minutes later I was banned from asking a question :(

I really just wanted to know what kind of woman they found acceptable."
386,Double_A_92,"I got banned a few months ago when I pointed out that their ""Catenary Arch"" project is a donation scam, and also that *all* the original Mods have somehow been replaced by new accounts without any Karma..."

388,KhajiitFL,[Banned for a meme 🤣](https://imgur.com/a/rWNj9qq)
389,AmbitionOfTruth,I'd say that went well. https://www.dropbox.com/s/dqv02w7bthmj6du/bannedfrommgtow.png?dl=0 They didn't bother explaining why I got banned.
390,,"r/waatgm is a decent one to check out.  Level headed, at least for now. "
391,-Entilzha_Valen-,"Well...got banned from there...again.  Not sure if it was for recommending this sub to someone who sounded more reasonable than most of the ‘tard’s there...

Or if it was for telling people to read the article in a linked post and not the narrative driven synopsis that someone made.

Basically the synopsis said the woman got away with the crime, she was released no charges.  But the article said she was re arrested, charged with multiple crimes, and was undergoing a psych evaluation.

Proof positive that the narrative is the most important thing there and not any form of truth.  Sounds like /r/politics."
392,Supernumiphone,"> Unpopular opinion:
> 
> Being in the rage phase and venting it on MGTOW1 is fine in the context that men rarely get this ooprtunity elsewhere.

I'm not sure that it's all that unpopular around here.  However I think that encouraging it is [a mistake](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/unique-everybody-else/201303/internet-ranting-and-the-myth-catharsis).  I'm not saying that people who are angry shouldn't be encouraged to discuss their anger and its underlying causes.  I am saying that the constant focus on negativity over on that sub is counterproductive and only helps hold people in that state and keeps them from moving on to better things."
393,cooler_water,"Yes, but the majority of MGTOW1 posts/comments were all about misogyny, and anyone that thought otherwise was shunned by the masses. That isn't healthy "
394,FlourishedCass,"I've been browsing again for the past few months and I've realised that I haven't really missed much. Just the same old memes as the past 3 years but with more inciting violence and incel garbage. Granted there are a few good posters there with thoughtful shit, like Dang, but they all just get drowned out or downvoted.

&#x200B;

I also got a lot of shit for responding to a woman and actually talking to her like a human being; it's absolutely pathetic how the sub has devolved into men vs women."
395,Mindraker,"This (MGTOW2) sounds more like a Gentleman's club than a hate group, which MGTOW1 was turning into."
396,ATLpunk86,"Speaking of memes, MGTOW1 tends to suffer from what I like to call - not knowing the rules of the internet.

Sure, we all know about rule 34. But what about 33? That's the one about lurking more.

Seems to me there's a bit too much spouting off at the mouth over there and not enough choosing words wisely."
397,Marshmallowpenguin12,"I got banned for the same reason.  /R/MGTOW IS basically TRP AND REDPILLRAGE Refugees.

TRUE MGTOWS GIVE NO FUCKS."
398,Take___It,Same those guys have a hatred of women. 
399,Oldschool085,Only means you can't reply. 
400,Marshmallowpenguin12,"Bro mgtow1 is for the dudes who subscribed to the blue pill and are regretting it. 

Mgtow is mgtow1 before the influx of TRP/INCELS.   We took red pill, got out of MG1.

2nd wave MGTOW.  MGTOW1 IS TRP and INCEL.  

Mgtow2 is better."
401,-Ecliptic-,"yup, then they mock people who ask them why is the only thing they do bitch about women when they are supposedly ""GTOW"", they think by they themselves talking about it, it doesn't make it a valid question."
402,Membrudo,"I haven’t been given any reason at all, it was just out of the blue. Didn’t know was full of faggots there"
403,binkerfluid,they are basically half MGTOW half conservative propaganda at this point I guess
404,,[deleted]
405,fryhldrew,I'm kinda sure they're 80% full of incels right now
406,Uncle_Vodka_237,"They probably view guys sharing information which reveals they're not virgins as 'bragging'.

I don't think virgins should be shamed but from my experiences talking to a lot of them and reading their posts I get the idea that it's pretty much impossible for them to be fully red pilled."
407,BoskOfPortKar,"Well, that makes sense for why I've been banned too then."
408,purge1,"Sleeping is obviously a femoid kind of thing, LOL."
409,William_A_Bishop,"Me too. The only thing I'd posted that was remotely controversial recently was that i thought women were people and i tried to treat them like i do men. 

I pissed of some dude, so he probably reported me. After the moderation change, i think that someone is trying to turn ""mgtow"" into ""incel"" in the minds of the average person.

Edit: honestly, i should probably thank them. The place was slowly turning me back to constantly thinking about women.. "
410,Membrudo,So now it is mgtow2 where the real men hang...
411,discord_doodle,wow...I swear reddit is a shit site to be on but the sign up process is too easy
412,Implausible-asset,"I can tell you why I avoid women 24/7. Speaking only for myself:

1. Marriage is a raw deal for men. Everyone knows this. I dont want to subject myself to that kind of slavery.

2. Dating and girlfriends: Every girlfriend I've had has either cheated on me with someone who had more money or a better position in life. Monkey branching. I dont fault them for it now, it's just their nature. And I dont enjoy the feeling of a breakup when I was thinking everything was ok. Casual dating equates to more buying free dinners than romantic reward, and it's expensive I'd rather use those resources on my self. Also the breakup psycho factor. Consensual sex and turn into a rape claim that without any investigation at all can ruin your life. No thank you 

3. Women in the workplace: I am 100% professional all the time, and make sure I'm never alone with one. A false claim to HR about touching her butt or her being offended by a joke  can have you out on your ass faster than 5pm comes on a holiday weekend. It's not worth the risk.

4. Day to day life: they only talk to you if they want something from you. And I dont want to give them anything. I want to do what I want to do. 

Staying away from women keeps me focused, energized, and moving forward. It's the way I mgtow, and mgtow is freedom. "
413,thalobby,They're probably afraid of getting #metoo'd
414,NathanHollister,"Un, that's the point of MGTOW. No women= no chance of having your money stolen, no chance of getting metood, no chance of returning to the plantation"
415,-Ecliptic-,anything besides hardcore female hate will get you banned sooner or later.
416,Yasai101,I agree
417,xpillx,"Ohhh I think I know why I got banned from reading mgtow vs mgtow2 topic. There was a thread some mgtow made and he posted a sexbot and said he would rather fuck that than a real woman. I was instantly wronged about it. I said something like:
""I dunno man... stuff like that creeps me out. Id rather fuck my hand watching porn or fuck a real woman (escort or maybe relationship but no marriage).""

I think thats healthy mindset and my preferance. Seems like those sweaty losers got triggered and banned me lmao."
418,jasonmiles2014,It is really incredible the vitriol being spouted there.  Failing to adhere strictly to their holier than thou philosophies will lead to you being called every name imaginable.

422,squiddy_s550gt,I got heavily downvotesd for the same thing on my previous alt

So when someone says anything that isnt in line with that narrative, the OP or commenter is reported and banned. 

It's unfortunate to see it go in that direction, because it makes it annoying to sort through 50 posts of bullshit to find one good solid post about mgtow."

Surely it would be easier to accept that normal people age in different ways, it's mostly dependent on lifestyle choice. Or am I missing something? While genes do play a role I'd argue that money /epigenetics is a far stronger contribution to change.

Conversely, having kids just makes one more future feminist. Because odds are good you lose the kid to a feminist wench, or the public school indoctrinates your kid, or college indoctrinates him. Kids are fine, as long as you adopt and homeschool him. Otherwise, he's probably fucked no matter how redpill you are"

You have talk about what women do and their behaviors and how it affected you. It's good, its healthy. And it helps other men who may be stuck in similar situations find their way out of it. 

But what they do over there now is just bash bash bash women all the time but they dont offer solutions, advice, or success stories. "
504,-Ecliptic-,"I got banned for pointing out they are the flipside of the SJW coin.  They were bitching about Captain Marvel being to SJW because of female lead...

The time before that banned for pointing out they hate Game of Thrones because it has a few strong female characters.

But like in any sub reddit you’ll likely get banned if your going against the sentiment within that bubble of thought.

I agree platonic relationships are important, but they are hard to sustain. Friends I have that are girls disappear when they get into relationships 9/10 times and I hate when they breakup and want to be my friend again. But yes I enjoy female friends."

You weren't ""genuinely"" trying to understand us. At all. No one bought your BS. And of course you're here portraying yourself as the victim of the banning that you yourself have initiated. It's almost like clockwork.

And you wonder why we pledged to stay away from your gender as far as possible."

Now the Incels (those who simply cannot get laid for the life of them) start claiming to be MGTOW, and spewing toxic female hate comments, have really ruined the face of the community. 

MGTOW2 is very humble and less interested in bashing women. I am open to discuss female nature, tactics, AWALT, but I don't hate them for being what they are. Its about us, not them. 

I was banned for my comments in MGTOW and really dont care. This sub is the true face of rhw community, and represents what it stands for. "

528,Spike-Ball,"Thank you for this. I was really interested in MGTOW at first, until I spent some time on the sub Reddit and saw by far mostly posts that focused on hating women. Hating women makes them just as bad as the extreme feminists that hate men. The existence of one justifies the other, and perpetuates it.

I thought it was great to see posts showing a member enjoying their life and doing something fun, until they make additional effort just to hate on women within the same post. And of course they ban anyone that criticizes or calls out their bullshit."

Oh, crap. I just had a hilarious, yet horrific, and likely inaccurate, thought. What if all of the mods weren't only women but *feminazis* who only created the sub to lure men to it and encourage them to post misogynistic BS so they can use a 3rd party program to extract user IPs, and are creating a secret database of ""the enemy"" to doxx them and bring them to ruination? Honestly, a lot of the things posted there would cause those men to get fired if their employers saw it. That would explain why they ban people who make sense. They *want* people to be as depraved as possible so when they finally out them, it will do significant damage.

Over the time period I was at MGTOW1  I could see the mods becoming less tolerant and more willing to use the ban hammer.     Was this because of the fast growth of the subreddit, now over 100K?    Perhaps they became overwhelmed somewhat.     Hope a similar thing does not happen to MGTOW2 as it grows."

Even if someone is a feminist, or a murderer, or a white collar criminal or worst of all, a pineapple on pizza guy, I treat them with a base level of respect as a human.

They all aspire to be narcissistic self-serving all because of female experience. But how is that any different than a woman? 

MGTOW is married to the idea that you'll be happier without solipsistic women in it. But you become self-serving solipsistic yourself. You also become utterly miserable without fulfilling your biological imperative. It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons. 

Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men. So what's the difference? Because all I see is men like this too. Especially MGTOW men who aren't interested in building community. I spent a year trying to build a community around MGTOW with users and they were never interested. All they want to do is moan about women all day. 

MGTOW doesn't make you happy. Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving. Society as an whole has become too big. Where as men and women would thrive in smaller communities. There are too many issues just to blame it all on women. And as society increases so does its lack of empathy and the feeling you are just a number. So better to build small communities. But no one wants to do that. But eventually society will get that bad, they wont have a choice. "

I am simple man I see boobs and I press like.

It is more than just a joke. That is why naturally men are more attracted/capable of doing in e.g STEM. It is our culture to which highly honors these values as important. I do not agree with that and feminism is actually damaging woman on the long road. Just as men are *better* in natural fields, woman have insticts and operate on levels unimaginable for men. Man can be Simping for years and could not see it but woman will notice the shit much more quickly. You can lie a woman for a year but to a man awhole life. They have *antennas* or special instincts (mother instincts) that cannot be accessed by pure logic and intellect.

Long story short, until human being destructure its imagined complexity back to the basics. Hunting and protecting for man, nurturing care and submission for woman. We are together doomed. In this dooming it is best to go your own way until things restart themselves."

625,38yearsoffreefallin,I’ve never seen evidence to support that. I looked at the averages and it’s about the same between men and women. I believe men use their experiences more to create and innovate however.
626,RingosTurdFace,"Men do dominate the higher end of the IQ spectrum (I forget the figure but above a certain IQ score it`s 13 men for every woman) however... men also dominate the lower end of the scale too.

Women are clustered much more in the centre.

So a distribution chart of IQ for women looks like a typical normal distribution whereas for men it's a much flatter line."

a lot of women that I've seen in real life would NEVER take responsibility for their mistakes and would always blame others. they just seem too immature to be marriageable. you can't trust these women, they can't keep secrets, and they always talk about stupid things and make drama out of trivia.

645,,">The idea of MGTOW isn't about building a community. 

The fact that it's a community based subreddit that states to its members that it's nothing to do with community goes to show you that it is utterly self-serving. How is that any different than any woman or man you meet today in society?

MGTOW just plays into the narcissistic division segregationist society. It literally says, ""Okay society, you win! Now let me get my fill"" and instead becomes exactly what nihilist society wants in a MGTOW's own image. 

How did I draw that conclusion? That chase of career. The chase for material. Elliot Hulse said it better that ""I'm with you MGTOW but you focus too much on the matter. The mother world. The material.""

And I believe he is right to some extent. There's no harm in bettering your career but if that's all you do and all you aspire it material, what is your legacy? 

>Being self-serving doesn't mean I'm harming anyone else in the process

Not at all but its essentially why societies collapse. It's a communist-like mindset. And as the population grows into self-serving narcissism so does the utter disdain and divide amongst people. 

>MGTOW has made me happier than I've ever been, so I don't know what you mean by that. 

It's all about how it makes you feel. Which is the issue with this society. It's always self-entitled. Self-centered thinking about its own self. It doesn't want to better the lives of those around them. It is one degree away from feminism.

>Learning to not depend on anyone but myself for happiness is the biggest step I've taken in my entire life. The fact that there are shitty people from both genders has nothing to do with why MGTOW is still relevant.

MGTOW is relevant in a nihilist society. I've come to the conclusion its a way of coping and becoming just like modern women. Which only serves to divide and segregate everyone. 

But you never see MGTOWs want to get together and build a community. All you get is, ""MGTOW is about your own path"" And being surrounded by self-serving entitled men just reminds me of a male version of feminism. 

What beyond the basics of don't get married and be careful does MGTOW provide? There's no pearls of wisdom beyond a few YouTubers. Majority of golden posts are from The Red Pill and books that don't follow the self-serving approach.

And MGTOW can't even do what they set out to do anyway. They focus too much on negative female experience. They talk about women all day on MGTOW1 and how much monsters they are. They give women their power away by making them the boogeyman/woman.

Atleast The Red Pill aspires for community. Atleast it brings men into its fold and looks after them within their small community. MGTOW does nothing but worship the self. And that's how we got here in the first place.

So you can say MGTOW has helped you. Perhaps it has. But I didn't come here to serve myself. I came here for brotherhood because without it any community inevitably collapses. Just like the PUA community did.  Stronger together, divided we fall. And it will always be this way. A community without guidance is going nowhere. 
"
646,Impossible-asset,"One thing that is an important consideration when you are talking about the principle of ""AWALT"" (all women are like that). It is pointless to bring up ""NAWALT"" (not all women are like that), because unless someone is genuinely disturbed in the head, they will know that out of the 4 billion women on the earth, it is not even statistically possible that every single one will be an ""awalt"" type. 

The whole reason that AWALT is even a saying is because there is enough of a risk in dating, relationships, and marriage today that AWALT is a reminder of a real danger you face as a man. 

If I were given a 50 gallon drum of apples, and only 10 of them were poisonous, but the only way to tell the poisonous ones from the good ones is after I take a bite, I wouldn't be worried about what my odds are of ""finding a good apple"". I'd slap a big warning label ""DANGER: POISONOUS APPLES, DO NOT EAT"" on the side, and leave the whole thing out by the dumpster for trash pickup. 

That's what AWALT is. It's a warning that engaging in an activity has many detriments, and few benefits. It's not a scientific statement. 

Many guys get stuck in being angry after being on the receiving end of a ""poisonous apple"" when it comes to women. And so they choose to walk away from that in the future. Some stay angry, which is what I am hoping to help get them out of by having a sub like this where they can talk with other mgtow men about how they can move on successfully. The other mgtow sub is for staying stuck in the anger side of things. 

What women do mgtow men want? well, depends. When it comes to marriage and cohabitation, the answer is none. For myself, I extend that to girlfriends, dating, and any non-professional relationship. Though some mgtow men are open to that."
647,Deadpanpancakes,"Its not so much that there are a few ""good women"". I think looking at people through the lens of good and bad are too simplistic. People as a general rule are selfish and self serving. Obviously it is to a degree that doesnt jeopardize other things they want. Also, people tend to delude themselves into thinking that they arent ""wrong or bad"" when they want to justify doing something that is pretty abhorrent. Im more concerned about the society around us that holds women to many double standards or the fact that theres sometimes no recourse for a man and nobody seems to give a shit.  You take the shaky moral relativistic nature of women and their selfish attitude and combine it with the male hating legal system and you get men opting out because it is the reasonable thing to do."

649,DJDickJob,"There's nothing wrong with building a community, it's just not the central focus of MGTOW. And like I just told someone else, for me MGTOW is mostly a mental/spiritual journey to better yourself. I'm opposed to the idea that you have to ""hit the gym bro"" or make a lot of money, I don't live by those types of principles. I mean, if that's what you want to do, then go for it, but material things like that have nothing to do with the point of MGTOW. "

651,Jmick1090,"This guy is trying to bullshit you.

>MGTOW is married to the idea

This is psychological word play.

>You also become utterly miserable without fulfilling your biological imperative.

This is an out right lie. Having a woman does not make a man happy. If you are a miserable man when you have a woman you will just be a miserable man with pussy.

>It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons.

It does matter that not all women are evil as you say. There are plenty of evil women to go around and all it takes is one to destroy a man's life.

>Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men

This is the men and women are equal lie. Why? Because lets say you have 2 children, the one every time he does something wrong you punish and the other child you allow to do what ever he wants. Who do you think is going to be well behaved the child that was getting punished every time he did something wrong or the child that you did not punish when he did something wrong? It's obvious that it's going to be the child that was getting punished when he did something wrong. In our case men are being punished and women are being allow to go unpunished or get a slap on the wrist. Just look at
all the women that have falsely accused men of rape for example. When was the last time you heard of a man falsely accusing a woman of rape? There is no way men and women are going to act the same when women have the state backing them and men just have
themselves backing them. Also men and women are different so they are not going act the same. Men were the protectors and providers because men think others. Just look what happens when there is a catastrophe. It's men that jump into rescue others at a risk to their own lives.

>All they want to do is moan about women all day.

What this guy is effectively saying is if you're going way why do you talk about women so much. The reason men need to talk about female nature is because we are trying to help other young men not to fall into the traps women and society are trying to get young men to fall into.

>Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving.

Obviously men are going to start becoming self-serving. What did you expect men to be generous when women are so selfish? So men should just continue to give and give and give while women continue to abuse men?

>Society as an whole has become too big

So this guy is into eugenics.

>There are too many issues just to blame it all on women

MGTOWS don't blame all issues on women. We know simps are also part of the problem too.

If a woman said to her friends ""I'd like to go, but I better not, my husband wouldn't like it!"", her friends would be concerned and ask ""Is everything okay at home? Are you being bullied?"""

756,i_are_panda,"""Western"" feminism is just feminism now.

With America's steady rise in popularity in terms of entertainment and politics over the decades, people all over the world have been increasingly made more ""western"", which translates into taking in all the bad points of being an american.

Even in countries like mine which couldn't be further from US, both geographically, and socially, you can see the cancer of western feminism creeping in and breaking society from the inside.

It's difficult to think where feminism is going right now, but for me, feminism as a movement became redundant by the year 2000. Hey, atleast you don't have to worry about fake allegations right?"
757,rquasius,"I've said it before and I think Jordan Peterson has too.   The only way this problem with Western women will get solved at this point is if SANE women start countering the wackiness of the 3rd wave feminism being spawned.

793,,"The problem is that the extreme majority of women who are anti-feminists still want all the power and privileges feminism has brought them.  They are against feminism for victimizing men (and for being crazy), but just as strongly against removing things that give them advantages and power.  Such as legal preference in child custody and alimony and the stupidly easy divorce laws, etc.  And when I say ""legal preference"" I mean that the woman is by default the legal provider to the child and so there are actually men out there who pay their ex-wife child support even though the men in question have custody of the child.

Basically, most women who are anti-feminism are pro-girl power.  Which is feminism just without being openly anti-male.  Feminism = anti-male to get power, girl power = pro female to get power.  The power and privileges and dominance they want is the same, they just try to get it by being nice instead of by being hostile."

One of them is a libertarian voting white man, while the other is a Republican voting latino man. One of the my other trans friends is openly pro-Trump, who she sees as the only person who's crazy enough to stand up to the ""liberal"" left (her words, not mine).

On the larger screen there are groups like Gays for Trump who are definitely not aligned with #metoo folks.

As all of you know, there's a personal and professional cost to not being on board with these liberal movements. Especially if you're living in a large, ""liberal"" city, it can be very isolating for LGBT people to be vocal about their beliefs about these catchy-named movements which lack any substance. Not making any justifications though

798,,"Genuine question - how do you think I could've stopped getting the award? 

I shared here because I wanted to get it off my chest and fwiw, this seemed like the only place a post like this would be tolerated (even with a throwaway account). Do you think I was treated more positively because I was a woman? If yes, how could I have stopped that?"
799,,"Skepticism is very healthy, especially of things online.

I mentioned elsewhere that I do believe I got and still get special treatment. I despise that, but most of the time it's out of my hands. Those who know me will vouch for the fact that I don't seek it out.

I do think I can be metooed falsely. False allegations of this kind are usually made by people who are mentally unbalanced, and there is no scarcity of psychological issues in the lesbian community. I've had one very close encounter with something like that. I'd share it, but I feel I've shared too much identifying information already, and I don't want to get doxxed.

I'd probably get 50/50 custody ... unless my ex could spin my lack of support for feminism into something evil. I don't know, and I don't want to find out.

Our experiences are definitely different. But that doesn't mean that I can't see absolute abuse of the social and judicial systems at the hands of these women. I have seen more things than I've written here. It's not just about me receiving shit at the hands of women."

801,,"I have to make sure that I'm not being put in leadership positions just because I'm a woman. I've actually been offered to lead teams in areas I'm not comfortable in, and it's a bit of a pickle trying to figure out how to weasel myself out of it without ruffling feathers or causing drama. If I say that I don't think I'm capable enough for the role, people seem to want to ""encourage"" me (because women need encouragement?) 

Luckily, the team I'm with right now, I'm fully certain that I'm a right fit for them, and they for me (at least till six months ago, when they hired the other two women). I know I'd be miserable if I were in a position I wasn't qualified or capable of being in, and I'd fight that tooth and nail. I take pride in my work, and I derive a lot of my self esteem from doing a good job at whatever I do -- I'd hate it to be taken away from me.

This is precisely why I'm against how programs advocating more diversity in tech fields are structured. It just makes everyone miserable.

Having said that, I'm sure I have received opportunities because I was a woman. The prominent one that comes to mind is that I funded my graduate studies partially off a women-only scholarship. I'm not sure how I feel about that. On one hand, I feel that if someone wants to pay money to a certain group of people, they should be allowed to do that. On the other hand, it sucked very bad to see my male peers go through financial difficulties I didn't have to go through, for the most part (though all of us, men and women, were broke, to various degrees, in grad school)"

A nitpick with how you phrased this: I think most women have no idea that MGTOW exists. 

Women and **men** discount MGTOW when they initially hear about it because it goes against the current narrative: men should get married, or at least pursue women, so that they can be happy(!) 

I think the kick-back against MGTOW is through a genuine desire to help men achieve happiness(!) by getting married. 'Won't you be lonely', etc. Painting it as though women hate MGTOW because it teaches men to put himself first is too broad a brush. Certainly some women might see it that way, but for the majority of women who hear about MGTOW: their criticisms of MGTOW are similar to men's criticisms."

What I predict will happen is either society will self correct completely, making gender distinction once again fashionable and even marketable. A push back mechanism against this gender neutrality. This could make this whole gender war just a cringe phase in our history. There's still room for ""Something in between"" in this. 

Another possibility is the eventual elimination of traditional roles or behavior models attached to sex. This is the ultimate end game of this feminist agenda. 

Either is a solid possibility. Humans are a highly programmable species. Our sense of morality and normality changes over time, and if things continue as they are now, it's inevitable."

[And THIS time I really mean it!!]""* phase.

-
I've also noted that -- per both statistics on divorced guys, and my anecdotal observations of men in general -- THAT stage typically lasts anywhere from a month to about a year or so (maybe a bit longer if it was a ""brutal"" breakup or devastating divorce-rape) -- before they start ""testing the waters"" (flirting, eyeing up women to at least potentially ""date"" or ""hookup"" with, logging onto {or back onto} Tinder, etc)...

-
And then, in about 2/3 of the cases, within 5 years they're ""remarried"" again (in scare quotes because they MIGHT just ""cohabit"" instead, avoiding the official-legal paperwork, as if that will save their arse)... with **most** of the remaining 1/3 just taking a bit longer (possibly having one or more ""aborted midstream"" attempts at relationships that fell short of an actual LTR/cohabit/marriage).

-
Overall, I'd bet that LESS than 1/10 (~10%) of them **actually** manage to live the rest of their lives as *true* ""MGTOW"" -- they're just TOO habituated to either the sex and/or the ""in a relationship"" identity, etc -- and too ILL-equipped to actually ""go it alone."""
854,EmptyRedCloud,">even my dad who knows nothing about MGTOW

Yeah my Pops told me on the phone the other day, while talking to me about my younger brother with 5 kids and a ex-wife/2 baby momma ex-GF's milking him for child support and giving him a bunch of drama that would drive any man insane.

856,Frelsi_8899,"I view most women this way. 

Here's an experiment. 

Try to have female friends where the quality of the friendship is on par with your guy friends. Suspend any sexual desires, and just try to have a friendship. 

It's when you start holding women accountable to the same standard as men. When your expectations of their behavior are the same as men, that's when you'll start seeing the core problems. 

Most of them are psychotic. Most can barely keep an actual conversation. Most cannot escape their nature and cannot fathom you in any other context outside that of utility. Regardless of your best efforts to befriend a female with any hope of forming a normal friendship. Disappointingly you'll end up just being that nice shoulder to cry on. 

You'll quickly fall into the stereotypical bullshit where you sit around listening to her relationship woes. Until she's vented enough, has a paradigm shift and now has no need for the dynamic of the relationship she pushed. So she will drop you. 

Sorry to say this, but we only ended up in this shitstorm thanks to feminism. In our school days, we had it right. Most of us weren't friends with girls. We had a saying ""Chicks are for banging"". 

I'm 42 now, and yeah I even have a few female friends. They're all ""normal"" by female standards, but when you get closer they're flakey, self-absorbed and frankly a bit insane."

Like just to debate that there are gender differences I have to disarm the previous points; which these points aren't even freaking real. It is exhausting...and a waste of time.

And then the irony of it is that the ""new"" one they eventually pick -- choose or fall for or end up with depending on how you look at it/label it -- is often (and we're talking *blatantly/obviously*) ***cut from the same EXACT cloth*** as the one they just divorced/got divorce-raped by/were alternating between crying & raging & grieving over just a year or so prior when they were in their reactionary (faux-MGTOW) ""I'm DUN with women!"" stage/phase.

-
We're talking almost IDENTICAL... as in even down to their NAMES\*...
-
So they divorce and/or get divorced by *Louisa* (that bitch, can you believe she cheated with the NEIGHBOR, expected to be forgiven and for hubby to still be NICE to that neighbor?)... but then FF a couple of years and who do they hookup with and marry but a 2x divorcee (with kids and thus one or more of her ""ex/baby-daddy"" guys nearby), and she is named... wait-for-it... *Luisa!*  

-
WTF? That's like trading off an old used Chevy because, well *""it got dented up in an accident""* and you just CAN'T STAND the idea of driving a dented up car (etc) -- but then going out and buying **another** old used Chevy, except one that's even MORE dented up because it's been in *multiple* accidents (and from the looks of it possibly even driven in a ""demolition derby"").

-
Moreover, while there usually ARE some -- relatively superficial -- differences (i.e. the first wife was a blonde, the second a brunette, etc) when it comes to voice & speaking pattern, inflections/accent, even general overall behavior & ""character"" of the person... DESPITE the insistence of the guy that ""this one is DIFFERENT from the other one""; the resemblance is sort of ""uncanny""

-
A half dozen guys that I know PERSONALLY (as in been friends either with them or with their families for decades) have followed that EXACT same pattern\*\*... it's to the point that I figure one can PREDICT (with something like at least, *if not better than,* 50% accuracy) both when and who (name/character) they WILL ""partner up with"" again in fairly short order.

-
**But to get back to YOUR point...**
-
Yes I'd say you're correct in that it is somewhere *around* if not ***more than half*** of the guys on various MGTOW forums (/r/MGTOW and /r/MGTOW2 especially) who follow that pattern.

---

And then, as you said at the end of your prior comment:

>>On the other had you have guys like me that aren't mad, we just don't give a sh!t.

EXACTLY.
-
Unfortunately... because MGTOW forums are virtually the LAST ""male space"" that allows such bitching *(sort of the same as why the guy being cheated on/divorced ends up calling his [never-married] BACHELOR buddy at 2AM*\*\*\**)* -- we end up getting painted with the brush of THEIR ""blue pill raging."" (And while **WE** calmly, coldly, objectively {and yes often a bit harshly/brutally} talk about the REALITY of female nature {and MALE nature as well, though that is often overlooked/forgotten}; **THEY** {recently or 'in the midst of' divorce/d guys) come in, repeat & exaggerate the points about WIMMIN... in an angry ""red pill"" RAGING-story fashion, bitch about their wives/gf's {especially the ""cheating"" etc}... and so the accusations of ""misogyny"" {which then have some validity}.)

-
Just like the ""incels"" -- the not only NEVER been married, NEVER ""fucked""; but *most often NEVER dated, kissed, or been even the least bit 'intimate' with a female in real life* -- who plop in, MISunderstand what MGTOW is about (often only imbibing and regurgitating the superficial ""meme-pic"" garbage), and thus contribute to the mischaracterization of the whole enterprise.

-
**The TEMPTATION** is to BLAME them... but of course the fault really lies with US (the true/actual/real ""MGTOW"" -- that is time-tested/proven as such); in that **we take PITY on these ""pathetic"" creatures** and let them into our ""clubhouse.""

-

---
\* Which I often have to wonder whether it isn't ""on purpose"" as a sort of safety/insurance -- I mean so long as the name SOUNDS the same, then if in some moment of passion (or memory error) they say their EX's name, well no one will be the wiser -- but regardless, it's rather WEIRD/TELLING that the guy who WAS married to ""Louisa"" ends up marrying a ""Luisa""; or likewise with other name-combos; the guy who divorced ""Cathy"" then marries a ""Katherine"" [Kathy], or yet again from Sarah to Sara, Susan/Suzzane[Susie/Suzie], Mari/Mary & even Marianne/Mary-Anne, Ginny/Jennifer[Jenny], Kristina/Christiana [Kris/Chris & even Krissy/Chrissie etc] and so on...

-
\*\* And there are other elements too: basically the DEPTH/HEIGHT of the ""RAGE"" and/or depression/crying that ensues... is a predictor, **not** of them *truly* becoming or following MGTOW, but rather the opposite; the MORE they rage (or cry, complain, etc -- same thing really) the MORE likely they are to ""return to the plantation"" for round #2 (and #3, etc).

-
\*\*\* Mainly because -- well not only do WE actually ""understand"" the situation (we've seen/heard it dozens if not hundreds of times before) -- but we're the only ones that will (or even practically CAN) actually TAKE their calls... especially at that hour of the day/night.  They DARE not call their other ""married"" buddies (assuming they even have such), lest they create further problems."
872,EnigmaticRonin,"Yup, you can see this with Jordan Peterson, and I'm not even a fan of him, but just watch how his logical points are completely disregarded.

Over the last year I definitely see tiredness and bleakness wash over him. To me this reinforced my idea of ""shut up and do."" The time for talking is over. You want to help men? Mentor them, guide them, help them network and get jobs. No need to talk to anyone, that is what females do...sit around and gossip to get another being to do the heavy lifting. Men just DO...period but this is getting lost."

Moreover, the following:

>>Usually, at least from my own personal observations, the single mothers who are getting praised aren't getting praised for intentionally raising their children alone, but for doing the best they can to raise them alone because the man bounced and is not being a father.

That ""Usually"" there at the beginning tells me you have an inherent **prejudice** in this regard... one that you are NOT being honest about."
876,Frelsi_8899,"The enabling aspect in all of this is that many people alive today are just living off the technological advancements of others. They do not have the intelligence to actively participate in this. They have no real social obligations either. 

They walk around with a very limited understanding of things because they're so arrogant they assume anything outside of their sphere applies through their projective nature. 

They also have far too much time on their hands and get deeply caught up in first world problems. 

Now a subset of these due to their vindictive nature and misguided compasses are just in it to stir social unrest. Some even might believe they're doing good, but without the intelligence and foresight, they cannot fathom the deeper implications of their agendas and they have no empathy to begin with anyways. 

They're a product of ""Princess syndrome"". They believe they're special, better than everyone else and always correct.

877,,"I specifically said ""in my experience"" for that exact reason. You may have a valid argument if I implied this was a fact in all cases. However, I made it very clear that my statement was based upon pure anecdotal evidence. Why are you so determined to be combative over such a non-issue, anyway? In my observations, that, indeed, is usually the case. That's strictly *my* reality. If you've observed and/or personally experienced differently, that is strictly *your* reality. It doesn't make either of us entirely right or wrong, nor does it suggest that the scenario described in the OP is purely a fabrication that never happens. I was offering a different perspective on the point in the discussion which is based on a false premise; that all single mothers are proud to be single mothers and shamelessly flaunt such a status. 

There are multiple causes of single motherhood where praising said mothers for raising their children alone is appropriate. The example I listed  in my original post is common in my community. Right below that is the father being murdered. Right below that is the father being imprisoned. All of these examples were caused by either the fathers themselves or third parties. The single mothers who manage to raise their kids alone when faced with these situations deserve to be encouraged for it.

On the flip side, single fathers get special attention as well because they go against a negative stereotype that fathers turn deadbeat when they separate from the mothers of their children. They also receive well-deserved praise if they raise their children due to the mother being an addict, imprisoned, or dead. There are many variables to these situations, and frankly, I find it crass and myopic to paint all single mothers with a broad brush because of this."
878,EnigmaticRonin,"Yup, I concur completely and have arrived at the same conclusions after conscious deliberation. Good news is that I truly do believe now is an awesome time to be a man and to help sharpen the few who have decided to desire something better.

That way maybe more corrective action can take place. Quarantines should be temporary depending on the circumstances as well. 

I understand that many MGTOW people have far right views.. but there are legitimate issues that men face today (as there are with women) that have discouraged them into relationships and so fourth. 

Personally, I see courts bias  (child custody/divorce), state laws bias, a need for mandatory paternity test at a child’s birth and cultural expectations that reduce men’s equalities in some areas. These I believe, are legitimate and noteworthy concerns.. I don’t understand why instead of a actual debate of these issues, that I ought to be labeled an “incel” or some other derogatory name.

Their lack of action to outright calls to violence from the Socialists and Communists on reddit and failure to equally enforce the rules/TOS are a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the requirements of 47 U.S.C. § 230. 

Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco and thus must abide by US laws. It isn't in their Terms of Service or rules that they are acting as a Chinese State Actor, thus they are conducting fraud against US Citizens. 

This censorship of US citizens is a violation of their First Amendment rights and private company or not, they operate a social media company on US soil. In the 2017 US Supreme Court case, 2017 Packingham vs NC, the Court stated that social media companies and cyberspace are the modern public square for discussing and disseminating ideas and this First Amendment protections apply.

Reddit acting as a state actor of China and censoring, banning, shadowbanning, or deleting US Citizens posts or quarantining communities is National Origin Discrimination pursuant to 42 USC § 2000a. US citizens and Patriot's have a right to free enterprise even on social media and it is a violation of US Federal Law to discriminate based on their National Origin, even Patriotic Americans whose pride and beliefs including gender roles and outright opposition to systematic Misandry prevalent in modern western society you may not share.

I mean, Red-ditz is a corporation and corporations are always, **always** giving themselves heartburn over liability issues.  After the incel and alt-white invasions, though, I say ""no love lost.""

Mods 'round here are gonna have some work in 2020, that's for sure."

923,SavageArchon,Why is it quarantined?
924,Renzolol,Why are you behaving like leftists mods? Let people talk about what they want where they want.
925,Fer1015,"I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand I feel that they took what they deserved, when they proceeded to censure and bann everyone for holding and sceptical view about how they were handling the movement. On the other hand I'm not very confortable with the way Reddit is going, it might be the first step to label whatever subreddit they want under ""hate speech"" for staying in the opposite side of the spectrum of some minorities conformed into pressure lobbies who wants to impose their views as the only accpetable in the name of social justice here on the internet."

928,redzox18,"CMIIW but isn't MGTOW supposed to be the 'fraternally supporting men into maturity and good masculinity' kind of sub? 

70% of the hot page as I see is all about 'women/feminist being assholes' but it always appealed to me that being an asshole goes both ways. 

Seeing the bashing posts only seemed like some people spent too much time on the sub and not on ~manly~ self development. Not on ~going their own way~  No wonder it got quarantined if that's the case

I mean yea women could be hoes (experienced it first hand) but men could be playboy assholes too.  It's not *Men Going Their Own Way* if they keep talking about women."

937,sigma4488,"Of course it’s quarantined, it’s an incel breeding ground with self deprecating people that cannot look themselves and blame others for their problems. 

I’m sorry you had no game or social skills in high school and couldn’t get a girlfriend. The world isn’t evil or out to get you. It’s time to grow up and not be self hating. 

Act like an adult instead of crying over spilled milk. Get off the internet. Socialize. Be better. Do better"
938,unknownmgtow,Did they shut down feminists subs too.. or is reddit being sexist?
939,bluehorserunning,"The R0 of the Wuhan novel coronavirus is between 1/3 and 1/4 that of influenza, and the mortality rate is between 2-5% (probably closer to 2).  The people who die are exclusively immunocompromised, elderly, or otherwise already ill. 

Yes, even a 2% mortality rate is very bad, and yes, an R0 of 2 is enough to sustain transmission in a large population... but it is nowhere near what you would need for a bioweapon.  If it goes global, it will be like the modern era’s bad flu years at worst, not like the WW1 flu. Which is bad, but not the end of the world. All of the data suggest that it came from bats (like most of the Coronaviridae), via some other animal. 

Please do some actual research before you spread conspiracist theories and fear-mongering."

941,Nevek_Green,"I like how far-left views that have killed over 200 million in the last hundred years are fine, but far-right views have only killed those that killed 200 million people are somehow bad. Pro-tip, don't play their narrative games. You'll lose every time because it is as easy as simply declaring your defense or objections the new bad.

See every believe women argument for proof."
942,VestigialHead,"I agree with this.  Insta quarantining is not a sane thing to do.

Same with insta perma bans.  Should be removed.  Ban for three days as first warning.  If the person then continues to break rules and a mod goes to ban them it will then open up more long term bans.  Only giving the option for perma bans after three lesser bans have been completed.  Anyone who is then perma ban could be checked by the higg tier reddit mods to make sure it is not simply mods drunk with power."

944,FirmFirefighter,I don't know but I am raising a toast to its obnoxious moderator being banned.
945,redsenior,Double standards
946,imthewiseguy,I got autobanned for posting a comment in menkampf literally seconds after.
947,TigPlaze,"Plus, they used a straw man as an excuse.  They claimed some MGTOW member was planning terr0r attacks and that law enforcement tracked his web searches of dangerous topics.  They didn't quote a single post this person made on MGTOW.  So someone can click on the ""join"" button and then search for nefarious things in a search engine, and get a sub banned.  Notice they never explain exactly how a MGTOW moderator is supposed to police what a member searches with a search engine or why that's supposedly a reasonable expectation."
948,,"True, but the real reason it's quarantined is because many young men come across it while browsing reddit. There's a fear that if more men continue to leave the plantation, feminism is dead in the water. What an embarrassment that would turn out to be."
949,Trek13,Reich wing shit like this is part of what doomed MGTOW1
950,VAJattConfederate,Issue is this mate Reddit is a private web site that pays for it's own server space. They can ban and censor what they want. I myself am an ardent MGTOW and reject a lot of hate society places on us  men especially in family court. If you all want your own spaces go to separate websites and servers managed by MGTOW supporting reddit is useless.
951,,"I remember reddit being vehemetly opposed to PIPA/SOPA legislation in whichcensorship was the main concern, and now THEY'RE censoring stuff they don't like. Bunch of hypocrite wankers."
952,MrDanduff,Goes both ways man. I remember at the beginning the sub was full of posts focused on empowering men without being toxic when discussing about women. It became real nasty the past 2 years.

Now it’s a clusterfuck cancer shitshow of overflow users from r/incels and a bunch of them got modded and now circlejerk each other over banning people for wrongthink."
964,Bloodrain_souleater,Spoken like a true feminist. You do know the so called feminist sisterhood preaches the same damn thing. Mgtow is individualism not group cult bullshit.
965,BilboBagginhole,There is this:  [https://www.goingyourownway.com/](https://www.goingyourownway.com/)
966,thisisd0g,"It's called MGTOW2. The original mgtow was packed with incels. Which by itself isnt necessarily a bad thing as I can understand where incels are coming from - dealing with similar problems when I was younger. But it becomes an echo chamber which can produce some pretty malignant attitudes. 

MGTOW (at least to me) isnt about hating women. It's about being indifferent to them."
967,Pedang_Katana,How come it doesn't count? I rarely visit that site so I've no idea what's going on behind the scene.
968,fmanly,"Yeah, I had seen the same thing. It is just quarantined.  Here is the behavior I saw:

1.  The sub disappeared from my list of subscribed subs.
2.  The sub's content disappeared from my front page.

I then navigated to reddit.com/r/MGTOW directly, and got the quarantine warning.  Once I acknowledged it I was brought to the sub.

At that point the MGTOW sub STILL doesn't appear in my list of subscribed subs, but now the articles do show up in my front page feed alongside other subs.

Bottom line is that with quarantine they are trying to get people who aren't actively visiting the sub to forget that it exists, and taking subtle measures to try to decrease the popularity of the sub, without outright banning it.  I suspect they have statistical data that the measures they're taking lower traffic over the long term, otherwise they wouldn't be stopping at what they're doing.  

I believe it also makes it less likely to show up in search results.  The goal is probably so that when guys type in the search bar ""does anybody else think marriage isn't worth it?"" or something similarly general they don't get pointed at MGTOW subs.  If they haven't heard of MGTOW already the goal is that they don't hear about it.

I'm skeptical that this sort of thing will do much in the case of MGTOW.  The trends that are driving men to go their own way are so large that it is going to be almost impossible to stop this without making big changes in how society works.  Half the trends on twitter/etc are practically advertisements for MGTOW..."
969,Americanpewdiepie,Yeah I can’t open it either. This is clearly forced.

986,Americanpewdiepie,"Why do you think? It’s obvious. They don’t want this idea spreading. Men, especially white men, are probably the most attacked people right now. It’s like a fucking white genocide right now. Obvious. Anything that gives men power back is being crushed."
987,rak__z,It's incredibly common for subs to limit discussions about current events to only one stickied post to prevent floods of low effort posts that are the same thing. They're literally providing you with a platform to discuss the event why are you even mad.
988,Impossible-asset,"Because the sheer volume of people talking about a certain issue in a new post every 2 minutes would quickly overwhelm the sub. 

Placing a mega-thread provides a place for people to discuss the issue or event without constantly rehashing the same point over and over, and leaves space in the sub for the content the sub is setup for."
989,Dissentient,"This sub was made in the first place because people wanted a place to discuss MGTOW, without being drown in posts bitching about women, which is 90% of content on /r/MGTOW. If you remove that rule, there's no point existence of this sub. You can just go to original sub instead."

It's unfair on the men who lost their MGTOW sub, when the women over there are given free reign to rag on men unchecked. Double standards aren't cool. Unfortunately, I doubt something will ever happen about that sub because they're women and society won't see under their facade. They can do no evil, right?"
994,azkoimo,Exactly it should be about empowerement mainly
995,jcar99,"this was my main issue with that sub. i had to unsubscribe because after a while it was extremely obvious that a majority of the people on there didn’t really care about self growth on their own as a single man, but instead hated women for virtually no other reason than because they were women. 

i was so sick of people just being blatantly sexist on their with their old, shitty, boomer facebook memes and everyone in the sub just eating it up. honestly glad it got quarantined"
996,MrJugsMcBulge,"There was always a bit of that in the sub, but it got a LOT worse once the Incel sub was banned.  Also didn’t help that TFM and other content creators embraced the “WAHMEN ARE ALL STUPID WHORES” incel faction."
997,Impossible-asset,"I disagree. This sub is geared to help you move forward. 

This is a place to put your money where your mouth is. 

You a mgtow? Ok. Put up or shut up. Post it. What are you doing with your freedom from women and the societal laws that aim to tap your resources and use you as a battery?

You making money? Getting healthy and staying fit? Out for a 3 week hike in the mountains with your dog? Travelling europe maybe? Or just enjoying a peaceful evening of quiet in a home you own (or even built?)?   

A lot of redpill subs provide a space for whinging about what made you angry. This sub is for you to show ""where are you going, now that you're going your own way?""

This sub is for looking forward, not backward."

1017,MgtowData,That suggestion is absolutely laughable. You have a large philosophical community you will inevitably have a large amount of different view.

There is a user on there I won't post his reddit screen name but he is literally all over it. Anytime there is anything said on there he says women only want money. This is guy is clearly rich but it seems his money is driving him mad. It is almost pavlovian as well as boring and annoying. He seems to be in denial that women want anything else in the world other than money. I can think of a lot of things they want that aren't about money (but probably require it- but hey thats how we are all enslaved if money didn't exist we would be murdering each other ). If you go on there and you don't know who I am talking about you will. Except oh you are banned!

Good overall summaries for non-healthcare people

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/
About 2% based on *known* cases. There are certainly many cases so mild that they do not come to the attention of health care. The vast majority of those severely affected and dying are elderly, ill, or otherwise immunocompromised. Last I heard, no one under 15 had died (unlike influenza, which kills many children every year). 

Now, how about you provide your sources for the conspiracy claim that it’s a bioweapon (note that I don’t take YouTube or shock jocks as ‘sources,’ and I’d prefer valid medical sources), and that everyone is going to die and civilization will fall?

1075,fmanly,"Sure.  I think the goal is to put enough suppression in place that the influence will slowly shrink, but not so much that it all scatters away and finds a new place to live.

Think about the torrent wars 20 years ago.  Imagine instead of shutting down napster/etc the RIAA managed to find a way to throttle it so that downloads worked, but were painfully slow.  If they found the right balance then a lot of people would have stuck with it due to the effort required to create something new, and then the painful experience would have helped reduce the number of people pirating content.  Instead they used a sledgehammer and shut everything down, and thus there was a huge void and somebody created a new technology to fill the void. Then because there was no competition, everybody rapidly adopted the new technology.  If there was instead competition between the legacy technology that had a painful experience but an extensive library of content, and a new technology that was better which nobody actually used yet, then that would have fragmented the community and slowed adoption.

I think that is the goal here.  Don't scatter the roaches.  Instead get them to huddle up while the oxygen is slowly removed from the compartment.  Plus you get less outrage because it isn't a complete ban."

This is for the men who are moving forward, not left behind.

It's like marriage and divorce stats. The state gives you how many marriages and divorces happened in X year, and the _crude divorce rate_ is simply calculated from these two numbers. They don't track individual marriages to find out if a spouse died or they got divorced after 45 years."

Before you start claiming white people are oppressed, look at the justice system. Black men getting sentences muuuuch longer and severe than white men ALL the time.

Except that is far from the only rules as published in your side bar,  if those where they only rules I may not have a huge problem with them.  Personally the rules I find most objectionable and subjective is the ""effort and quality"" rule,  ""civility"" rule, and ""relevance"", all of which are WIDELY subjective

Then there is of course the rule about ""No denigrating other subs for the quality of their content."" which is routinely violated when it some to talking about MGTOW1  and other subreddits you dislike which is amusing given your complaints about how MGTOW1 is moderated, a complaint I disagree with having seen nor had any issues with the moderation there.

>If your idea of ""going your own way"" is complaining about women, then this probably isnt the sub for you. 

While my idea is MGTOW is not complaining about women,  I left my rage phase well over 20 years ago.  I have been MGTOW for longer than MGTOW has been a thing on the internet,  and longer than many on this subreddit have been alive.  

However this subreddit seem to be more about Physical ""success"",  believing that the ""true path to MGTOW"" is body building gym rat shit.  I have no interest in that.  I pursue wealth building, FIRE, intellectual interests,  not dieting and exercise which seems to be focus of this place,  so you are likely correct this is not the subreddit for me

What you said about repeat offenders is your assumption, which isn’t true. Look at how many years somebody gets for selling or using cocaine vs crack cocaine. There’s a different in sentencing. Why? Because white people are usually the ones using cocaine while blacks use crack. Totally not racist right? Again, Brock Turner got released from prison because he was a “good athlete”, bet you the judge would have never thought of that had he been black. 

Also, yes, black people tend to have more criminal history than other races, but also because of the racist history our country has of keeping them under poverty. Banks wouldn’t loan blacks money for the housing market until very recently, 80’s or 90’s, something like that. Anyway my point here is that while not justifying it, it’s logical to believe a large group under poverty will do anything to survive, including crime. Then, you add the fact that job applications discriminate people based off their criminal history, and you get the high % of recidivism that the articles talked about. Not many opportunities + poverty + not allowing people to integrate back to society = perpetual criminal records."

I challenge mods all the time in Subreddits,  sometimes I am banned most times I am not.  I have challenges mods in MensRights, MGTOW, KIA, KIA2, and several others

I do not fear bans,  reddit to me a time suck,  something to do when I am bored.  I express myself if people want to ban me for that well that is their problem not mind.  Being a closed minded fool generally results in a shitty life. 

>But I'm not changing any of this sub because you disapprove

I am not asking you to,  I was simply pointing out the hypocrisy and bullshit.  I never had any expectation that my words would result in any changes. 

Subreddits like this never really grow beyond  a few thousands members because of the massive limitations on what can be talked about.  That can be a good thing, close knit communities can be good.  Sucks for a movement,  sucks if you are trying to bring actual awareness to what MGTOW is and how it can save men, but...

I browse MGTOW and MenRights in the hope that I can help a man cope with what is happening to him in his life,  this is why I am not put off by the posts in MGTOW1,  I want to help those men move past that rage on to something better.  You want to reject them and isolate them.  Different paths, different goals

>If you dont like them you can move on if you prefer. Nobody forces you to participate here. 

I probably will,  There is not much discussions here that interest me. I like to talk politics,  I like to discuss how the Culture war effects men, how politics effect men,  etc.  This is what I want to discuss,  you ban those discussions so...

Everyone in the thread ignored this part of the story, even when other people were posting links to the news article explaining the circumstances. The comments were disgusting, and not at all about GYOW.

1181,cleats4u,"8 months ago I got banned after years of posts and 23.8 karma rating mainly from that reddit. They got so scared of being shut down they just started banning everybody and they are still going to get shut down. That quarantine is just a warning before being shut down. Nobody really knows anymore what offends somebody else, you just better not offend any woman or liberal Democrat in this society. If they can't have you arrested, they will make you lose your job."
1182,RT-AC66U,Banned for unknown reasons.

I think it was because I told a guy he could have sex with a woman.

1184,Great_Sandwich,"Is this purported ""takeover"" of MGTOW *confirmed*, or is it merely speculation at this point?  

The one thing that *is* confirmed is that there certainly have been a lot of recent bans for the most innocuous of comments, lately.  They kicked my ass out yesterday.

And so significant are the number of bans that a mega-thread was created.  (GREATLY appreciated, by the way.  This helps.  Thank you.)

1188,ValhallaBoundBoy,"Banned with no explanation. After weeks of messaging mods one said that I was banned for 'concern trolling' and cited a specific post. The post in question was about a comment that people on the board make a lot, that 'women have nothing to contribute to a relationship'. Which made me think, What do we have to contribute to a relationship as men? Perhaps money, but what else?

It wasn't concern trolling it was a genuine question that wasn't just about everyone else, but about me as well. What do I really offer in a relationship?  A lot of people freaked out in the comments, kept insisting they have 'love, loyalty,' those vague intangible things a girl would say as well.

But some of them made a really great point: men are a human shield. We are expected to lay down our lives to protect a woman, even if we aren't dating her. If we are just walking down the same alley as a woman and someone comes after her, we are expected to put ourselves between her and the attacker. As for women we actually date, its basically a 'get out of jail free' card for as long as they keep us around"
1189,Superdogs5454,I got banned for saying that it’s not healthy to take steroids to a steroid user.

1192,UnfunnyName22,"Things Are Getting Out Of Hand (repost) (got banned from MGTOW for this statement)

Both MGTOW and feminism are at each other's throats like cats and rats and I'm getting confused about it all. There's so much hate that both sides have lost sight of what the actual point is. 

I thought we were all for equality, but all I see is women giving advice on how to subjugate a man, or men pushing for dystopian misogynistic ideals. At first, I was completely and utterly fooled by the MGTOW movement (being a man, of course) then after going through all the hostility, I see one post about someone climbing a beautiful mountain, achieving satisfaction, and being a better person from the experience. 

When I saw this, and then looked back at all the women slandering comments, I was like Jesus, this guy really knows what MGTOW really is. 

The people in that sub have got it all wrong, sure there IS inequality, but, throwing more fuel in the fire for feminist activists ain't gonna help.

I remember seeing a black man on TED who went to talk to the leader of the KKK himself, (link here -> https://youtu.be/ORp3q1Oaezw) and after so much diplomacy, got him to leave the group. It showed me that if each party respect each other, they'll bond and find trust within each other to work forward towards a common goal.

But with feminism (in it's current state) and MGTOW, it feels like the point is to pull each other apart as much as possible until a breaking point. Sure, there are pretty bad cases out there, but don't you think we should band together for a common purpose to change those laws and make it truly equal?

Both sides, men and women, have lost the point. MGTOW, if they are going their own way, need to cut out the obsession. Feminism and predominately 'feminine' groups such as the female dating advice subreddit, need to stop clearly trying to provoke bitterness between the genders and look for a common ground to start building good relationships with men over.

I'm just sick of it all, you can't trust neither side."
1193,Brandwein,"Banned from MGTOW for not hating women. Also banned from MensLib for beeing MGTOW. Yeesh. Seems like you can't not have radical opinions on reddit to not be banned.

1198,Mr_Crick84,"I was banned a while ago for simply saying a grown man had made the choice to be with a single mother and there is nothing wrong with that.

MGTOW was completely overrun with hateful incels and for some reason the mods were supporting them. All of a sudden incel terminology was being used to shame people that often had done nothing wrong.

To me, MGTOW was about internalising the rational male principles and choosing not to go along with it, Not trying to change human nature by shaming and hating on people.

For a group of incels that hated women and simps so much, They sure are sacrificing a lot to increase their SMV and be with them. I should have left a long time ago"
1199,Great_Sandwich,"Wtf..?  Seriously??  Yeah, I just got banned yesterday.  Why?  Couldn't tell you.  I think it could possibly be for referring a guy who laid out a bunch of VERY specific standards for the women he was looking for to a Christian dating site.

I basically just said that my thoughts vary from ""I'm 100% with you"" to ""sounds bitter, but for understandable reasons."" to ""WTF is wrong with you for glorifying sharia law?"". What should I say? Approximately 5 minutes after I posted this I got the notification that I'm permanently banned.

For many men it doesn't get better, particularly if the child died instead of just being taken away."

1213,MisanthropeArtichoke,"I guess I have to join the club. The comment for which I was apparently banned related to a female astronaut collapsing during a press conference. The assertion made was that the collapse is proof that woman shouldn't be astronauts.

R/MGTOW has been infiltrated by feminists and women complaining, this place is next because you Simps create divisions instead of just saying the truth, which is no one was breaking the rules in mgtow, no one was inciting hatred, only support and calling women out in their bad behaviour was what it consisted of. Anyone else saying bad things about mgtow is lost likely lying."

I'd been lurking there off and on for a while.  But the bullshit's gotten out of hand.  Yeah, there are a lot of shitty women out there, but I'm old enough and experienced enough to recognize red flags and avoid them.  Most of the posters there see fake red flags everywhere.

Then later I got banned from /r/The_Donald for criticizing a couple of Trump's policies.  I got banned from /r/news even though I never posted there.

Luckily I used a throwaway account but wow I can’t believe that mgtow defends incels as if we are all incels if I wanted to be part of a incel community then I would but then again I can’t cause I’m not ugly or fat or short so I don’t fall under any of those categories. The reason why I’m a mgtow is cause I been with too many women and they are all the same. Incels want to believe they are truly mgtows but are you truly a mgtow if you never even experienced betrayed by a women? Dated one after finding mgtow and realizing that everything said her is true?

It was a stupid argument I'll admit, and I regret getting involved in it, however i dont I deserved a ban.

That along with welfare(single moms make up 75% of welfare) are contributing to young single moms which lowers the pool of women men would want to date.
1287,TheValhallaBoy,"I haveb een banned again. This is my third time. The mod I had reached out to last time suggested I just create a new account so I did, and it's been less than a week, I've only gained 100 karma, and I'm already banned. No idea why. I refused to even get into disagreements this time, but it looks like asking for male only movies and making the title a tongue in cheek 'sexist movie club suggestions' was enough to do it."
1288,TheHentaiEnthusiast,"I recently posted something I seriously needed for my gender equality school report. Since MGTOW supported men, I asked about what the men of that sub thought regarding forced and toxic masculinity, and their personal experiences regarding it. I just asked. That's it. 2 mins later, I got banned - straight after a bunch of dudes flamed the comments, angry at feminists and somehow missing the whole point of the question being for my freaking school report. I'm not sure if anyone else will be willing to share feedback at this point, or also downvote me to hell lmao"
1289,BigFalcon3,i got banned because i dared to ask why so much harmless post get deleted by the mods xD
1290,RudiMcBallsweat,I thought why was my feed so pg lately. So some „ People“ decided we were too toxic or what? Gosh darn were alll only gentlemen in here who have enough of woman. It sometimes feels like People think were dangerous because of our un soceieterian beleves...
1291,Ishggy0785,I was just looking at my post history and I barely realized that the MGTOW page(thread) is not there anymore. That's crazy how it's taken down very quick.
1292,Skywilder,"Got banned from mgtow for trying to show fellow men a subreddit that is hateful towards men and believes in Wicca and that their magic tricks can solve the issue of the “Patriarchy”. Asked EXTREMELY POLITELY what proper steps I could take to remove the ban, as I thoroughly supported the movement of mgtow and punishment for false rape accusers. Never got a response. Low key glad mgtow got quarantined. It was filled with overflow users from r/incels and mods were becoming corrupt.

TLDR: Nothing new, just reddit being reddit. What goes around comes around."

1306,whatisantilogic,I randomly got banned one day and they didnt respond when I asked why 3x. A few weeks later the whole board got quarantined.

1321,eric77runningaway,"Women hating will never get you anywhere. Hating what you can’t have won’t get you anywhere. I see a lot of bitterness in this philosophy which many claim is a lifestyle, which it isn’t. You will regret MGTOW when you’re 75 and realize you have no lover or kids, but then try to use a dog as a means of filling in that void. Hate to break this to you guys, but that’s the gayest fucking thing I have heard of since Freddy Mercury."
1322,Fights-In-Dark,"MGTOW was a complete shit sub and they would ban anybody that didnt agree with the most extreme views and the mids wouldn’t even talk to you about it. I got banned for saying “It’s fucked up to mutilate babies, but I’m Happy I got circumcised because I like the aesthetic”"
1323,FirmFirefighter,"They aren't cheering that the site is being banned for being anti women, they are saying that the site bans them for not being anti woman enough. Is that too hard for you to understand? Most successful people dont like to be told what to do . The site claims to be all about men succeeding. But it seems they want psychopaths and dumbfu#ks on their site instead. For some of the cretins on that site, emptying their bowels without it being in their pants is a success. And noone wants to be told what to do by Dumb Donut"

1325,l0nes0mec0wb0y1306,So MGTOW nowadays is about bitching like a feminist but in opposite direction. What a joke.
1326,MGTOWMODSSUCK,this is exactly where I got my username from; calling out racism on the sub and getting banned.

That you dont need women, or any of the bullshit that femenism sells you. 

That you can live and be perfectly happy with your friends, your wealth, your health, your wisdom and hobbies that you enjoy. 

You dont get banned here for saying ""men only"". And women dont get banned here either just for being here. 

Anyone who comes here, and very simply follows the sub rules, is welcome to talk."
1336,Lil-Leon,If only that had been true and the sub wasn’t used to post super misogynistic shit at best and radicalized right-wing shit at worst. Then it would probably still be around.
1337,realMisterBryan,"Yeah I got banned for something similar. Someone was insulting the fact that AOC (who I don't even like) is *just a bartender* (which is totally false, she's a congresswoman now) and I said it would be like insulting Trump because he's *just a TV show guy* (which is also false, he's the president now).

Here is the comment:

https://old.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/ekenqp/the_word_men_is_missing_from_this_because_men/fdb5vf4/

TL;DR - there must be a real fag in the MGTOW mod team. I bet he rides a harley too."
1338,bhfanatik,"seems like it has become a MAGA sub. Any opinion criticizing Trump is downvoted to the abyss or even banned. They pretend they're going their own way but they fantazise about a conservative society and obssess about ""owning the libs""."
1339,MuleFool42,"Yep. They trigger easily to anything that doesn't conform exactly to their belief system. I don't get it. MGTOW should be for every man to understand as a lifestyle or philosophy to live by if they so choose. Everyone guy will have his own version of MGTOW, it doesn't have to be one-size-fits-all. 

Very limited thinking over there."
1340,Impossible-asset,"You're right. ""Calling attention to"" something =/= hate. 

Here's the rub. It is *easy* to bitch about something that bothers you. It often takes much more introspection and thought to come up with a solution. 

Here, this sub is aimed as representing the positive sides of mgtow. What is can do *for* a man, vs just complaining about women. 

Now, maybe by tightening things up on the posting guidelines, the sub might shrink. I'm good with that if what does get posted is positive and helps men show their accomplishments, or have meaningful discussions focusing on living a full and satisfying life vs complaining about the ""nature of wahmen"" and such. 

Jokes and memes and posts bitching about women have their place, it's just not this sub, and to allow the posts that focus on women or ""calling then out"", just detracts from the goal of this sub."

First, it means that you care and that you're giving power to the other person. It also isn't good to let hate rule your life because it's unhealthy. 

They absolutely couldn't have that, I suppose. I was banned with no explanation because their a bunch of scared little bitches that can't actually admit to their hate or they'll be quarantined. So they won't say anything,just ban people with no explanation."
1349,realMisterBryan,How do you know for sure it's not healthy though? I've heard some cancer and AIDS patients had a good result from steroids.
1350,Great_Sandwich,Same for everyone here.  Nobody ever gets an explanation from the mods.
1351,Impossible-asset,"I think you're confusing mgtow with mra's.

Mgtow gives zero shits about any of that. It is what it is and we're perfectly content to walk away from it, and the culture that goes with. 

I have no bitterness towards women or feminists. Their bullshit doesnt stop me from getting laid as I please, without having to compromise my own self-interest, and no risk of sexual harassment or divorce rape.

I just go to other places where the cancer of femenism has not spread. 

If you want to change laws and have some sort of ""come together"" moment, you are in the wrong place. 

We dont care. We're finding our own way to happiness and satisfaction in life. We've figured it out that quite simply, we dont need women.

Not because men and women need to hate each other (we don't), men just need to be aware of how society views them and how to mitigate society's negative influence on their lives. 

Instead, the focus is on hate and negativity. It could be so much better but the mods are children that can't see the big picture."

1410,Impossible-asset,"I disagree with that assessment. 

You're combining two different things.

Men who desire women but cant ""get"" them are involuntary celibate men aka incels or omega males etc. 

Mgtow men are men who *could* (and in the vast majority of cases, have) had women, and were often married, but have been burned by the courts in a divorce or seen how society supports the word of a woman in judgement versus the evidence given by a man. 

Both men may be angry, but incels *stay* angry. 

Men going their own way have decided that they want to simply walk away from the laws, gynocentric society, and drama that marriage and formal relationships bring."
1411,DJDickJob,">infiltrated by feminists and women complaining

You sound like one of those feminist women complaining. Or maybe you're an incel or a troll, I don't know, but you sound pretty out of the loop on this. r/incels got banned, then r/MGTOW went to shit, and now your stupid ass is on here calling us simps. Go fuck yourself. The original sub did start becoming hateful, that's why the first rule of this sub says no women-hating, hate and negativity. 

And when it comes to the negativity part, I consider all the shit I just said to be pretty fucking positive, considering the fact that you just called all of us simps when this a place for people that live a life of not being a simp. Go fuck yourself. ❤️"

1432,Brandwein,"There absolutely is toxic masculinity. It can happen in all kinds of forms when there are no good rolemodels. It's just important to differentiate that there is a dichotomy of good and bad masculinity, just as good and bad femininity. Else some may run with the idea that all masculinity is toxic.

I wish you good luck on that report."
1433,Mindraker,"> the question being for my freaking school report

Possibly being that you are a minor.  The user agreement indicates that you have to be older than 13 to use the site.  There are some websites that will ban you outright if you're a minor.

1434,REMAINSkull,"yeah fuck you and that virtue signaling other men and basically getting easy points from female teachers by presenting something about toxic masculinity, bullshit you deserved to be banned from all mgtow."
1435,MuleFool42,r/MGTOW is a bunch of bitchy little retrograde children. r/MGTOW2 is the real MGTOW.
1436,IamDiggnified,Last year I got banned from mgtow too. In there banned email to me it said “if you got banned then change your ways.” Sounded like femanazi bs to me. And there was no chance for redemption. But I look today and there is no more r/mgtow. What happened to it?
1437,lunchladyshand,"You can go your own way without being hateful.  

MGTOW went from being a positive group where men could talk about and show off the great lives and things they did when they refused the lives society demanded of them,then turned into something gross.

By the end, that sub had become just as toxic as r/incels."
1438,RadThaddeus,Reddit is still ebola G.
1439,MyFatThumb,"I looked at your post history and realised why you were banned. It was a misunderstanding. 12 days ago you made a response about circumcision. That you had studied psychology and it makes sense. You meant the previous comment made sense and they thought you meant circumcision made sense. Someone made a negative comment about your post, you got downvoted and your post was removed. The mod that removed your comment i guess also  banned you. Maybe it was a temporary ban for 7 days or something  I don't know. Try making a comment there and see if it is accepted or not. It weird getting banned from any sub with being given a reason."
1440,MyLittlePonyofDoom,Were they anti-incel posts?
1441,PresidentVladimirP,They banned me because I don't hate women and I simply don't want to commit to a relationship

1443,REMAINSkull,he’s just doing what fat women do
1444,Impossible-asset,"Ok. I know the one you're talking about. 

And yup. He caught a 90 day ban. 

Why?

Because his posts on ""pointing out the misandry"" were removed. He was told why. He was told this is not the sub for that. He wanted to insist that oh yes it was too the sub for that, and went posting more ""misandry"" stuff. He was again told not too, and instead this time told to focus on himself in a post not on women or the system... he again refused.. so .... yeah, the guy caught a *Temporary* ban, and was told he'd be welcomed back to post content that follows the rules and spirit of this sub when he returns. Instead he went to another sub and started yapping about this one. Ok then. 

Glass house my ass .... go over to mgtow1 and post some shit there and see how far that gets you with the mods. 

See if they dont bamhammer you immediately with no explanation or response to a message. 

Maybe go over to r / aww and post pictures of animal abuse because you're trying to ""expose those abusers""... let me know how fast you get banned from there. 

Dont come here, break the rules, ignore warnings, then get pissy when you catch a temporary ban because of it.

If you want to make ""mUh MiSaNDrY"" posts, there plenty of subs that will cater to that. 

This sub is not one of them.

No, I beg to differ. That's exactly what I DO want. 

And I have plenty of real life examples from my male role models and family members who were MGTOW and lived happily until their dying days. 

There is no substitute for your freedom. And I will never, ever, give that away. And hopefully neither will 13.3k (and growing) other men who see how good mgtow is for a man to adopt as a lifestyle choice.

1450,Sedition7988,"You won't have any of those things anyway even if you're not MGTOW. The divorce rate has only been growing, and over 80% of them are initiated by women. Enjoy your alimony and child support while losing that house you worked decades for, dumbass. If I have to be lonely when I'm old, I'd rather be lonely and still have all my shit than be lonely and have no retirement or property because I fell into highschooler-tier lust for some random chick that will never love you back.  


Seriously, go take a look at /r/FemaleDatingStrategy and come back with that 'just fall on your sword, bro' bullshit. It's all a game, and females are playing it to win(And by win, I mean extort the ever living fuck out of your before ghosting out and then telling all their friends and family you were a terrible person to justify their robbery or even outright malicious behavior done purely for entertainment). Most MGTOW, outside of the incels who are just shouting at the sky, are dudes that have already been burned and black pilled by things like marriage, and are now just doing what women have been doing for forever: Playing the game in their own way. MGTOW doesn't mean anything other than picking up your toys and leaving."
1451,Dunc0ne,"I also got banned for something non-sequitur.

1453,rojhalat,What?? Just read the comments man. All the simps saying they are happy its banned because the page was “misogynist”. I think its you who doesn’t understand.
1454,rojhalat,Lol I guess to you “growing up” is bowing down to feminists and belittling men. No thanks. Id rather stand against these femenazis and defend my brothers that are being attacked daily by these scum in every possible field out there.

I might get banned for this comment because as a reddit moderator (very possibly female) i do not how easily aggravate and offended you are, honestly after the initial experience i got after voicing my toned down and respectful opinion i wouldnt mind not continuing to visit this sub, this not an invitation to ban me though."
1459,cardboardbox47,I dont care for the antisemitism and misogyny but i dont want a sub overrun with fake mea like r/mensrights that argue with you and call you an incel if you point out the fundamental cons of woman.
1460,zennadata,"This reply to your comment:


Trump was a famous billionaire playboy. He literally won life and was the man everyone aspired to be, that gives him intrinsic respect, it shows he is good at life.

AOC was in indebted bartender. She was comically bad at life, working a job anyone can get with debt. She was poor and so bad at life she’d probably starve to death if not for the government.

Why should we take advice from someone who is so bad at life they would starve to death? This is how a country turns to breadlines.

Then people call us misogynists and toxic but totally ignores subreddits like FDS, that totally suggest to manipulate and take advantages of men. 

But oh no these aren't toxic, nobody bats an eye. Lol

I always feel weird in MGTOW forums because I don’t actually hate women. I just work hard to avoid typical female bullshit and cut any women out of my life who try to do it. Like, I won’t ever marry again, I won’t date someone financially less secure than me and I won’t give in to emotional manipulation."

I didn't even reply to the notification because I knew this would be a battle that's not worth to be fought and I have bigger problems that require my energy. 

Your right. It's time that women learn about the reasons why more and more men are disinterested in marriage, having own kids or just being in a relationship. It doesn't have to be in a way that tells us ""you're all a bunch of disgusting evil shits without morals and the only way you're good for is to wreck a men."" more like ""hey. No need to be mad. It's just that the current laws disadvantages us and we don't want to risk losing our money and even freedom. It's just self defense that, hopefully, sounds logical to you."" just to answer some questions other women might have. 
I understand your reasons why you avoid women in the way you do and I feel really bad for you. If it would be men who could completely destroy me after divorcing I would want to stay away from them as well. 

Let's just hope that government wakes up, changes the laws that allow women to ruin their men if they divorce and starts letting men keep their money and property and treats them equally to women when the question who gets the custody over the kids needs to be answered. Society could be so much better if this change takes place."

I do think that talking shit about women certainly has its place. Consider golf courses or cigar clubs or poker tables. Men need a spot to complain amongst themselves about shit that frustrates them, and for a lot of men, that is women.

Mgtow has nothing to do with a desire to ""get"" a woman. 

Mgtow is largely a response to bullshit divorce laws that absolutely destroy a mans life, a rejection of societal endorsement of that, and the newer phenomenon of using false sexual impropriety accusations to destroy a man (reference the New York times best seller list for the how-to manual for that). 

The response that mgtow chooses is to simply take the assets that would have otherwise been spent on maintaining a relationship (or later lost in a divorce) and spending it on ones own happiness and health instead. Walking away. 

That's what mgtow is. 

Yeah I'm an aging loser, all I've got are my friends, my almost paid for house, good income, freedom to do what I want with who I want and when I want, and a brewery. Poor me.

Reddit admins are far above mods. If they don't like your sub, they'll find an excuse to quarantine/ban it. See the Trump-friendly sub for example.  They can even go into the database and directly edit comments without any trace. If you want to create a free speech community, reddit is not your best bet, and I have no idea what is.

To me, that is the whole idea behind MGTOW- having the courage to do what is right for you regardless of societal expectations.

1652,rationalthought314,">The “shit test”. I was baffled why women I had invited to my home would be rude, ask weird questions try to what I thought was aggravate me.

I would say guys do it to but they are either assholes or being sarcastic and will let you know right away. But even the assholes are rather rare in doing this because they know such behavior could lead to an asswhupping or at least people not wanting to hang around them.

Some single women seem to think they are above society's niceness as though they were a celebrity. They see nothing wrong shit testing their host despite the obvious rudeness of it all.

However there is another reason for it as well. They think being a bitch makes them more attractive because they have been picked up by guys who were jerks to them. It's a reversal of expectations. Girls are used to guys being nice to them so they take it for granted. When a decent looking guy comes along and doesn't kiss her ass, she thinks he must be on a higher tier therefore she finds him more attractive than the nice guys. 

Guys are more used to women being bitches to them or at least cold and indifferent. Guys are just likely to be put out by a bitchy woman either getting angry or losing their self esteem. The guys not phased by it are the usual pump&dumpers whom the girls later will claim they are tired of due to all the ghosting."

This is extremely true. I don't come from a background of having been screwed over, my marriage never had time to go bad. So i never developed the personal distaste. Thus, i don't avoid women at all except the part of being alone with one.   


But i do see that the more attractive ones are the ones that can't in the least understand why they're not wrapping me around their finger.   


To be honest, If i would say that I have a ""type"" these days.. even though i don't engage.. It would be the plain janes. They are usually much more relaxed about things.

As a young man who has seen some shit, I'd say the females get a taste of power every time they do that. It strokes the ego and eats the soul- I did not intend to get philosophical with this. They want to feel like they've made a guy their little chump, to manipulate.
I'd say its quite fashionable for the female to have a little pussy-begger-slave behind her as I see this sort of behavior quite frequently. In my opinion, it gets her respect and jealousy from the others in the female collective or ""hivemind"". This phenomena seems to be quite ubiquitous these days, given the emasculating soy boy producing society we live in."

Caused chaos (affair with a co-worker, how cliche) But I've been in therapy, stopped drinking and have been doing the best I have ever been physically and mentally. And despite my username an excellent father as well haha. We've been talking divorce because despite doing well I just haven't had the ""passion"" she craves. Kinda hard to be passionate when she won't even touch me.  But I do speak her love language which is gift giving and words of affirmation. It just hasn't been doing anything. I told her maybe talking divorce would ignore that spark in me to want that from happening. How could I fear losing her and divorce if we didn't go through with it? And it did. Started researching and man...fuck I just don't want to do it lol. I know id be settling and that's a bitch thing to do but I just want to be absolutely sure for the sake of our child.

Well come to find out she's been cheating on me. Just found out last week actually. I don't know all the nittty gritty details and honestly I just don't care or need to know..I know all I need to know which is to get the fuck out while I can. 2 wrongs don't make a right and we both have contributed to making a shitty situation

So yeah...I just have zero fucks to give right now. We're going through with divorce and keeping it amicable. We're going mediation route, no lawyers. We make the same amount and want to split everything evenly which I'm cool with.

I'm just a bit scared in how I'll survive on just my income. Family is a state away. Ill be ok just may have to do some side gigs or get a 2nd job and figure out if renting an apartment or owning a condo/townhome would be best for me. A lot to think over.

1671,Heisenbergeffect,"Here's some things that helped me early on.   


Set up a home, make it your way and start living in it like YOU want to. But, my one big advice is this. Keep it clean. There is nothing that can bring your spirits down like a messy home, and once it gets really messy, the task of cleaning it seems bigger and bigger. It took a long time before I managed to pull myself together and start doing this right. But it made a huge difference in how i felt about myself. As well as being able to open the front door and not be embarrassed. I was in a long slump and my house was a total mess.   


Don't live to impress, get only the home you need. There's only 5 people in the world that actually care about your home, the rest are either ok with whatever you have or jealous. And you don't need jealousy in your life.   


Wealth protection before generation. Pay off your debts, even if it sucks. Don't start to try and invest etc until you have your debt situation well under control. ESPECIALLY high interest debt. a 19% credit card is a much better investment to pay off than the stock market. And once you start owning things that other people have payments on, you'll see how much money that actually is. I couldn't believe how much money I was able to save once I had no more payments. Even though I understood it theoretically, the feeling once you see the numbers start adding up in your accounts is pretty powerful.   


And above all else. One day at a time, nothing happens immediately."
1672,ValhallaBoundBoy,You're getting full / majority custody?
1673,MementoMordor,"They can't help it. It's in their DNA to test potential partners, they are not bad people. Just be aware.
In your case, she probably saw you as a provider of some sort. They have different rules for this and the ones they really want. 
Maybe you are soft or you got played by her or yourself. Learn, accept, adapt! (sounded like a self help book there :))"
1674,Uniqueinsult,"Well this is how the story goes these days man. I woke up at 17 after dating a crazy young woman, tested the waters of a relationship again at 18. Conclusion: weird world we are living in."
1675,BadDad01234,"This is all amazing advice thanks! Especially keeping my place clean. Our house as it is is a nightmare half the time and constantly smells. My STBXW just doesn't clean. At all. So most of the cleaning duties fall on me so I'm already used to it but it will be much easier solo. 

Fortunately I'm debt free. Unbeknownst to me my wife wracked up quite a bit of debt over the past few years. I might have some responsibility with that which sucks but you're right I will get whatever comes my way cleaned up first. I don't know much about investing anyways I do have a 401k going which is good tho"
1676,BadDad01234,50/50 which we are both cool with. She needs her mom and dad and we don't want anything less. As shitty as it is to say the week off will be nice to recharge (and make money hopefully) We've been doing it for a bit actually in just handling responsibility and it's honestly made me a better dad. I go hard on the love and attention and focus when I know she relies on me and no one else. I like it.

1684,ValhallaBoundBoy,"Your vernacular is cool with me, pretty sure most people use it the way you do, not the way I do. NGL week on and week off does sound like a nice lifestyle. Perhaps I'll find a lady one day who wants that kind of arrangement."
1685,ValhallaWillCome,"Rereading the entire thread, it may have been a diss indeed. Problem is that I can interpret  “maybe you are soft and got played” two ways. One being a diss and the other being a hint. Not putting up with BS is one, it's how you end the argument that either shows her whether you are ""strong"" or are feigning ""strong"". This is something women will pick up on rather easily, where you may not have. If he meant that, it's a hint. If not, a diss."
1686,iluvfrostidflaks,"i see your point. if thats what he meant then i’ll apologize for my other comments, but it really looks more like some random sneaky insult. and the point of what i said earlier is that these sort of tests and other asshole behavior won’t get women very far with men unless they find one who is willing to put up with it. in my case most of it was unwarranted and i stood up for myself early on after noticing a pattern of totally unwarranted bs. thats when she took off. lol."

Guys. Am I missing something here? This sub states it's for focusing on independant male life, not for focusing on women, and yet here is another shitpost about johnny Depp's girlfriend.

So. Heres what I'm thinking. Since I can remove these posts / lock these posts all day long and they just seem to keep on showing up. I'm thinking every time some OP who isnt an obvious alt account or troll breaks the rules, I lock the post, and then give OP 24 hours to post something about how mgtow is helping their life. With a positive perspective, or take a ban that gives them enough time to think something up. 

I'm serious... this is NOT a carbon copy or refugee camp for men who want to lay claim to being ""mgtow"" and just spending their time bitching and complaining about women. 

THINK about what mgtow is doing for you to make YOU better. Then post that. You can talk about where YOU used to be when you were blue pulled, and you can relate that to where you are now that you are a mgtow. 

That's what this sub is for, and constantly removing posts and saying ""refer to sub rules"" is not being as effective as I'd like in promoting the content this sub was meant to showcase. 

So... comments locked. Timer started. OP will you be a participant of this sub how it was intended for mgtow men? Or not."

Many people don’t even have that at Christmas. I’m thinking of seeing if there’s anywhere I can volunteer tomorrow instead of spending it alone and wallowing.

Sorry dog lovers -- I tried getting a dog and it just didn't do it for me.

It is possible to get plenty of physical affection without sex, romantic love, or commitment, via professional cuddlers. If that had been available to me in the past, it would have saved me a lot of depressive episodes and other disasters in my life."

The reason is that, for the past several years, we've seen nothing but all these stories about how ""science shows"" that men ""need"" sex and female companionship to be ""healthy.""

There are still some who are sticking by that, like the Campaign Against Sex Robots woman.  I've also seen some pushback against that from the femmstappo, specifically the whole complaint about the tendency for men to be ""emotional golddiggers"" on their wives, and that the wives need to be compensated for the ""unpaid emotional labor"" of loving their husbands...or...something...

Which means that more and more people, I think, are going to come around to our point of view.  And if folks like Sprankle won't, the feminists surely will, when they actually think about this ""need for human companionship"" and ""empathy,"" and realize the implications for them."

1756,Robert_is_a_Loser,"Yes absolutely get a life before considering getting a girlfriend. The last thing you want to do is make your girlfriend your ""life"" It's a mistake many guys make (including myself back in the day) 

Just become familiar of female nature to protect youself. If you have a life before dating you have the freedom to ""not take no shit"" when it comes to her because if you leave her you will immediately have more time and money to do what you want to do."
1757,Hawgster,After being betrayed and divorced. Still losing so much financially to it every month. I don't think I care to find a woman ever again. Just look forward to the rare times when I can get my kids. Pretty much what I live for at this point.
1758,GlobalAsshat,"That's really the way to do it. You hear that old cliche that you have to love yourself before you can love someone else. Life goes in a natural progression where important skills are built as you grow up and a lot of people get fucked up in childhood by not having good parents, a good father figure, or a good circle of friends, and that fucks up their personality, so they end up socially awkward, lacking the ability to hold an interesting conversation or make people laugh or in general small talk, and for men this really gives them a big disadvantage with women and life in general if they can't fix it.

Social-proofing is by far the most important skill to have in life. It's one of the essential skills that leads to a stepping stone to bigger things in life. A large majority of men have varying levels of beta in them but the ones who don't grow up socially well adjusted really end up being the ""creeps"" of society. There's also the matter of having no father figure and an overprotective, coddling mother... I've seen examples of what happens to kids with this situation, still living with grandma at age 40.. nice enough guys but never really pushed to be independent in any way. Women can get away with this because men are always chasing and ""saving"" them, but for men this will lead to a feeling of unfulfillment because men are biologically wired to want to achieve greatness."
1759,CDAYt,"Women? Bah! I’m chasing money fam.

When I tried out relationships after so much blue pilled peer pressure, all they have ever caused we’re a whole lot of distractions. Fuck that. Follow your heart and if women ain’t in it, fuck them as well."

1761,Curiousdude666,"Yes 100%. A partner will not ”solve” anything. Same way a boyfriend will not sudden make a womans life better. I think when you both have your shit together and have your own individual lives, then you are able to share your lives and experiences with eachother. In a sense, you are both independent, together."
1762,MGTOW_BEASTMODE,"Good!  Then when you are on a date you can ask ""so what do you bring to the table?"""
1763,dogwoodcat,"If it flies, floats, or fucks, rent it."
1764,wiggerman88,i thought the point of mgtow is to not have any more girlfriends?
1765,Traveler11819,"what's the old saying?

You will lose a lot of money chasing women.. but you won't lose women chasing money"
1766,rockstarsheep,"No matter what anyone says, your biology is going to predispose you towards wanting to mate. At a certain age, when your sex hormones kick in, and you have a sex drive, as sure the moon exerts an influence on the tides - you are going to feel a pull towards whatever is your sexual preference. That's just Nature / Life at work. It's an undeniable fact, for most people. 

Unfortunately, this can play havoc with you. And it does; for men and women. As this sub is focused on men and men's issues, we focus on that. In a way, ""MGTOW"" or ""GYOW"" is really a form of transcendency. That is to say, to transcend your natural drives; master them and shape them, so you create a form of life that suits you best. That's really just the beginning though. 

Over time, you change as a man. Your testosterone levels go up, peak, and then come down. Many men, mellow out, with time and age. They are less aggressive or seek to be less dominant over others. And a whole host of other changes.

There's inherently wrong with having different kinds of relationships with people. In fact, you need to relate and work with many different kinds of people over your life time. Men and Women, have been trying to figure each other out for who knows how long. Perhaps since the dawn of time. We form complex relationships with each other; whether it's family, friends or lovers. Some are long term relationships and some are short term. We all make mistakes; every single one of us. It's how we work towards resolving them, which counts more than anything else. Unfortunately we live in a very strange time, where there is a sort meaning vacuum and people are just super confused. A lot of ""traditional"" ideas, have been thrown away, being considered old fashioned, useless and meaningless. However, that can't all be true though. 

* Dignity
* Trust
* Faithfulness
* Honour
* Responsibility
* Integrity

Are these values and virtues, really to be thrown in the trashcan? I don't think so. 

And really, finding someone to really bond with, is incredibly, if not the most difficult thing to achieve. It does seem like a fairytale. I can maybe count three couples, over the course of the last almost half-century, that I consider to have a really good, mutually beneficial relationship. The next segment is okay, to not so great and then there's a vast gulf of just mediocre, to terrible and then awful. But it is indeed possible to find someone decent. How, when and where? Nobody can answer that. 

And my friend, the only thing set in stone is that you are born and that you will die. Everything is up for grabs. Probabilities and possibilities; you just don't know. The likelihood of better results, depends on you and the decisions that you make. You may need to take your time and work hard at yourself and those you allow in to your inner world. You probably will. 

The only ""advice"" I can give is to vet everyone in your inner world. Make sure that they add to your world and you add to theirs. More than likely the emptiness you feel, probably really has nothing to do with women as such, but about the meaning and purpose that you are going to give and find in your life. Seek that out first, and everything else can fit in around that."
1767,starfox863,Good for you
1768,Erwinblackthorn,"Women don't fill the void. They chain us to decrease our options. That's why they are called the old ball and chain.

Think about trying to travel somewhere. First you need permission from your bank, to see if you have the money. Then you need permission from your job, so you don't get fired. Then you need permission from the government to see if you have a visa. Then you need permission from the airline to see if you have a plane that will take you. Then after all that, you need permission from the girl.

She's at the top of the permission pyramid. The one factor that doesn't even involve the actual travel process, and this is the one that has top priority. And if you don't please that one, your trip becomes a miserable mess that you paid for.

That's the kind of stuff that makes us go ""why the hell do I bother adding that extra factor, when it doesn't even please me? What are my options?""

I know the options: hand, porn, hoe. HPH, or HPP if you want to pay for a prostitute."
1769,copper_blood,Also make sure your new girlfriend has a life too.
1770,Aszourus,"Saying the point of MGTOW is to not have a girlfriend is thinking with the original r/MGTOW mentality. Not all women are the same just like not all men are pigs. AWALT is a childish concept.
There are still women who submit to their men and are mother and caretaker figures who don't mind life being that way, these women are also hated by feminists. There's even women who actively have been fighting for men's rights before you guys even knew of this whole movement so be a little adult and logical and realize that while the majority of women all think the same there's always an exception to the rule.
Saying stuff like this is just like feminists saying all men cheat and all men are toxic.
MGTOW is putting yourself first, learning to recognize the toxic women and avoid them, doing what you want on your terms. If she wants to be in your life there's sacrifices she should make. And just like people said here, don't settle with anyone in any way that makes them entitled to take your shit from you. Be the best version for yourself that you can be, and don't let any woman stand in your way. If she doesn't like it that way then she can take the highway."
1771,bassheadstang,"Women are a burden on men, especially when you live with them. 

I’ve done the monk thing and found myself wanting to jump anything that wiggled. /r peopleofwalmart were turning me on. Lol

I’ve done the pump and dump thing and that became a lot of work. 

Tinder hookups come at a price. Bitches be crazy but I did meet a few that are cool. 

I kinda fell into the poly lifestyle and have become what’s known as solo-poly. I don’t live with women or commit to one woman. I’ve actually had a few at the same time recently. They have nesters that do all the bf/husband shit and I’m just the swinging dick. I currently have 5 on a rotation. They feed me and clean my house and drain my balls. I don’t have to do shit. They have no reason to lie yet some still can’t help it. It’s pretty sweet over all but you have to know women."
1772,neri_Skabadu,Both people should be in a right place for a relationship so if you're not ready never rush into it because it can ruin you. I know too many people who got heartbroken and burned just cause they were desperate. Live your best life and then if there's still some place for love find someone.

1780,soelc3,"> Women can get away with this because men are always chasing and ""saving"" them, but for men this will lead to a feeling of unfulfillment because men are biologically wired to want to achieve greatness.

And maybe this is a part of our nature that works against us, an evolutionary baggage we're better off casting aside. By definition, only a minority can achieve greatness, because to be great means to be great relative to someone else. The majority of men are going to lose in the arms race of greatness, just like the majority of men will be betas no matter how much lifting and self-improvement they do, because the game is always graded on a curve. Individual men can rise up and down the hierarchy, but only at the expense of other men, as the 80/20 rule remains in place. What the majority of men need is compassion and a path forward, to self-esteem and self-actualization, that doesn't rely on throwing themselves into Darwin's grinder for a shot at reproduction."
1781,CalmElk,">for men this really gives them a big disadvantage with women and life in general if they can't fix it.

Why do men need to attract women before they can go MGTOW? This sounds like gatekeeping.

> Social-proofing is by far the most important skill to have in life. It's one of the essential skills that leads to a stepping stone to bigger things in life.

Why do I need to care about the rat race? I just want to go my own way.

People should love themselves but they shouldn't have to attract women and reach the top of society to prove their value."
1782,avtarius,The point of MGTOW is playing the game on your own terms ... Not all MGTOW are monks
1783,1st10Amendments,"AIUI, the point to MGTOW is to avoid entangling interactions with females; by which I mean no LTR in one’s personal life and to be VERY careful in one’s business dealings with women. 

For some MGTOW, a STR MAY be a risk worth taking, but NOT to cohabitate or to intermingle finances in any way. 

For others, it may mean Monk Mode, whether that’s be for a short term or permanently. 

Other than that, MGTOW is about self-actualization and personal growth. 

But I could be wrong. YMMV."

1791,neri_Skabadu,That's kinda selfish and it's not really a healthy relationship. Both people need to work on it. If he wants a relationship it's gonna change his life (though if he's in a great place hopefully not much). Relationships can be amazing if you choose the right person and do it right.

Through some of my other comments, there are glimmers of the truth. To put a finer point on things; no, I haven't. I suppose if I might be able to help others, then I could be persuaded to discuss my blunders and the insights I have derived from them. Truly it is a treasure trove of what not to do, and occasionally a nugget of wisdom. 

What have I started, very slowly, is to create some YouTube content. It's not specifically MGTOW, but it is related to finding and living in a meaningful way. Believe it or not, I have some training as a therapist, so it integrates some of that. 

Now, if you have a particular subject that you find important and might want me to write on, I would be happy to consider it as a contribution here. What do you think?"
1798,Aszourus,"Exactly.

We spend years spoiling the shit out of women, meeting every single expectation they have and then complain about them being spoiled. Works the same as with your kids. You raise them to be people to get everything they want asking as they beg or cry for it they are going to grow up to be pieces of sh*t who don't know the worth if anything and are used to being spoiled."
1799,MajIssuesCaptObvious,"You can have a gf, just don't give her legal rights to what you've worked for by cohabitation, marriage, or having a kid."
1800,Frinkst21,"The exclusivity is a non-issue to me. The issue is men are expected to adapt and give up so much for their partner which is why they feel so lost after a break-up.

Maybe I hang out with simps but it seems like it's very common for the woman to have the last say in most relationships and decide most things."
1801,TheVineyard1996,It's about not having a woman dictate your life. If we want romantic exclusivity and sexual fidelity then that is fine as long as it is on our OWN terms. Understand? We aren't priests nor trying to be James Bond sleeping with every woman we see. It's about going on your own path regardless if society wants us to or not.
1802,avtarius,girl in your life doesn't mean they're a gf ...
1803,qemist,Anything you have freely chosen is your own.
1804,nocivo,Fuck all the girls you want with proof of consent and never marry. I personally don’t risk it but not all people can go monk. I would still prefer to pay an escort if I needed sex. Safer and less problems attached. Today girls are way high maintenance and the game of marry and in some places even living together can fuck up all your life efforts. No ty. Bros is all I need. Maybe a pet when I get old and get a house with a backyard.
1805,Naz_3000,"No porn, no masturbating equals more quality sex and a better grade of women.

I've gone my own way already.  Meaning upgraded my life.  Which automatically means upgrading to a better grade of women."
1806,Naz_3000,Read the post slower.  I answered your question already.
1807,impossiblezagnut,"I'll try to think about it, do you have an idea regarding a subject that isn't touched upon very much surrounding red-pill communities?"
1808,Fer1015,"I wasn't talking of our duties as men, i was talking about man-hating propaganda and media, and destruction of the father role-model in society. But in fact is our fault for not seeing it coming for decades and standing up against all this BS. I guess.

By the way not everyone has enough strength to swin against the stream, (or in this case enough personality ) swimming over the waterfall and becoming the dragon. I wish you luck chasing the dragon."
1809,Aszourus,"We as men need to start changing the way we treat women and show then they need to work for it, or be without us."
1810,impossiblezagnut,"It's only expected because men were and still mostly so widely inclined to do so.

More people, and more importantly, young men are increasingly becoming conscious of this, which is why we see a large shift in dating strategies and the masses abandoning the olds traditional ways."
1811,rockstarsheep,"Pick something that is relevant to you. That always makes it easier. 

You have touched on a very interesting subject though. In fact this might be something to explore. What is it though? 

There is no *summa summarum*; which means. There is a sum of all sums. A coherent system of hypotheses; whether these are ideas that come to us from the sciences, philosophy or any of the other humanities - that neatly folds things together. At least not in this particular subject. 

It would then appear, that there is no central theme, beyond the very narrow confines of such ideas as - hypergamy^•. 

^•= I call to attention, the notion of hypergamy, because it is one of the bedrock concepts of RP ideology, as it relates to the nature of women; and for two reasons. 

The first is that it might very well be a retrospective projected idea, less than what reality actually is, in itself. Some academic work has begun to actually interrogate this concept, and it would appear, that it may not be completely true in an absolute sense. 

Now, this is not unusual. Often, with knowledge, and the discovery of it, we can at times, mislabel certain phenomena, because we either do not understand it.  Or, out of convenience, impose a definition that is meant to be temporary, but through common use, becomes the standard definition. 

That is to say, it may indeed be incorrect. This poses a problem to someone like Rollo Tomassi, Richard Cooper and a whole slew of others, who have purchased their position of authority on either, misinformation, disinformation, or pure chicanery. They have a vested interest in maintaining and defending their position, because, in one way or another, their relevance and in some cases, their income relies on this. They have a vested interest in their truth, as it pays them to do so. They have an incentive here, which also stretches further in to the lives of those who take their thoughts, opinions and insights as incontrovertible truth. 

As no one has risen to the challenge, or indeed opportunity, to test the hypothesis of hypergamy as such, the idea and those who advocate it, have been safe in their assumptions. However, this is slowly changing. There may be an element of truth to it, however, it may also be, that it has been starkly over emphasised. 

Just recently, Shawn T. Smith; a highly trained and capable psychologist, has very politely, questioned hypergamy. And it with some interest that I watched Rollo squirm, as the headlights of professional rigour and experience, started to question, what really might be a pet theory at best and pure speculation at worst. 

Rollo has the gift of the gab, and can twine a word salad of concepts and ideas, in order to muddy the water. He can, as a fall back, cling to the notion of the stories he has heard from others, and use this as proof. Now, there may be some truth, in the stories of others, but there is such a lack of sophistication in terms of definitions and the collection of data, for the purposes of deriving some sort of truth; that cottage wisdom will do ... for now. 

That is not to victimise or lionise him. We all make judgments of error, and believe in incorrect assessments. Every one of us. It just gets highly amplified when a personal misgiving is transmitted to a broader audience, that then accepts it as unquestionable truth. The concept may require some calibration, however, that may cause the invalidation of some of the key premises. 

We will see if the truth is more important than the individual, in good time. 

Now, the second part is this. 

The nature of men. I have yet to encounter a term, such as hypergamy, when it relates to the *innate nature of men*. I am quite confident that the feminists would clamber to screech out the term; Patriarchy! 

Laughable as that is, it is still a very powerful concept at play in our world. It is at best, a shorthand summary to describe how women have been exploited and victimised for the benefit of men. Now, before I descend in to that pit of hell, I'll stop. And continue as such.

Men **and** Women can behave themselves in less than ideal ways. Both sexes can be destructive, shameless, thoughtless, cruel and otherwise indifferent. On the reverse of this, both sexes can be creative, remorseful, thoughtful, kind and interested. Some men **and** women, can exhibit more or less of the above. And we can further narrow things down. 

Moving on; some men are not particularly fantastic human beings. They can exhibit some of the lesser qualities that they're accused of, but to wholesale clump everyone together, is a massive mistake. This also brings in to question, the measure or measures by which we want to judge men or women. Who is deriving the score card, and how are they keeping score? What are they enumerating and quantifying, for the purposes of judgment. Nobody really seems to know. It is taken as a given. 

There are no easy to grasp values to use, but general concepts of acceptable behaviour. They in themselves can be horrible stereotypes, or indeed, truths. 

So, we seem to lack a critical framework, by which to evaluate and comment on the nature  of men and women. Beyond the tropes of; ""Lift and make bank!"" 

My little conclusion is this. We need to be critical of accepted wisdoms, or apparent truths, and not go with face value agreements of their validity. We need to have proper discussions to explore the ideas that we have been given. To me, that is an essential part of going your own way; responsibility for the evaluation of information, for the purpose of defining a set of values that you can live a good life by. 

A very big problem to overcome, is the demands of immediacy. Now, now, now. Most good things, do not come about in the - *right here and now*. They take time to cultivate. It takes work. It requires some humility, patience and courage. And most of all, it demands honesty. That my good friend, is quite difficult to achieve. And it is a problem that has been with us, for a very long time.

So, there you go! My little thoughts for the day. Thank you for your kindness and I hope that you are keeping and doing well."
1812,Aszourus,"I am talking about also our responsibility, you say media as if it's an entity of its own run by itself. Let me remind you most big media corporations are run by men themselves. So yes we have been digging our own graves for years. The existence of simps should be proof enough that enough men keep catering to women and in turn making then expect that kind of behaviour from everyone. and BTW I'm not the op, I'm not chasing any dragon. I am a happily single man doing my thing. But that doesn't mean I am not reasonable or logical enough to realize that you can not neither man or women 100% all in one group and say ALL of these people are the same. Believing that is plain ignorant, even though j agree there aren't many women who are different."

1828,Impossible-asset,"Tomorrow is Valentines day. 

I call it Ballentines day, (an ENTIRELY underrated scotch, fellas. I mean no shit, its GOOD).

So I treat myself usually by getting dressed up, I buy myself a long-stem rose and go to a steak house. I'll have a scotch (most places have at least a couple good selections). And I'll have a big fat porterhouse. I have beer with my porterhouse. Good Dark beer. Then I pay my bill and leave. But heres the twist. I leave the OTHER rose that I dried over the mantle for a year on the table, and take the new one home to dry. I put it in the mantle over the fireplace to dry out in the coming year. Yes I do this, yes its kindof stupid, and I enjoy it immensely.

I take the bill for the evening and I total up the cost of the scotch, meal, and uber to and from the steakhouse, and then I double it and put that extra amount (I would have spent on a dste) into my stock funds to make interest in the coming year). 

It's a stupid ritual I've done for the past 10 years or so. It just reminds me of how short-lived a valentines day celebration can be, and when I look at the rose that's drying on the mantle, I think of the money that is making me interest instead of just being gone. 

Sunday I'll be getting myself a nice young Korean whore in DC for a couple hours to enjoy, my dose of eros for the quarter.  

Then I'll kick back with some more ballentines on the rocks, and some good english tobacco from my grandfather's pipe, and enjoy picking my guitar on the back deck and watch the sun silhouette the hills before dipping behind them. 

Love yourself. Treat yourself, have a tasteful reminder of what you walked away from, and associate it with your increasing wealth as you do something for your own, pure enjoyment. 

That's what I'm doing on ballentines day weekend."

1923,onbakeplatinum,"I get along fine with the women in my life, I just have no interest in dating and find the majority of women out there unappealing, just like I do men. And I like being alone. I wish mgtow2 was named ""mgtows against misogyny"""
1924,CDAYt,"I don’t even believe that some of the people on MGTOW1 genuinely dislike ALL women either. The sub has become a place to aggressively express frustration in poor partners in the past with the name MGTOW attached to it.

People complain about the habits of the gender they’re dating, its entirely natural it doesn’t inherently target every single member of that society. Those guys just need to stop calling themselves Mgtow"
1925,sus_not_sus,You're in the right place brother
1926,poison-fang-blade,I consider myself purple pill and think that the truth is somewhere in the middle. I still feel sexually attracted to them but I don't think that's even worth approaching them with that intention nowadays. I find it hard to connect with the vast majority of them even at a friendship level. Most of them look too boring to me.
1927,ChadManning1989,"r/MGTOW is now just r/Incels rebranded.

If you have questions, or observations on life in general, r/MGTOW2 is all for it."
1928,ohishitmypantsagain,Many here can attest to being banned from MGTOW1 simply by not blindly adhering to their mantra of woman hate.  Anything exhibited that is slightly less than frothing vitriol and BANNED!
1929,DoctorMartain,"I would take a step back from Tinder and Social media all together , try it for a few days , delete the apps so the notifications dont temp you to take a look."
1930,BunsAreBest,"Not all woman are like that but a lot are. As a woman I talk a lot with other woman. I notice how we can say what ever they want about men. Here’s some not needed examples: I only date tall men, that guys butt is cute, he is suck a dick, any short guy is not a guy. If a guy said any of this about woman, he’s being sexist. We need to get rid of this double standard. It pisses me off so much because woman preach equality yet say this shit. It’s not equal, society is going to turn woman dominated if it continues."
1931,michaelklr,"MGTOW sub is truly the male version of feminists with no logic or reasoning, all MGTOW does is try to control free thought and speech. Mgtow2 is completely different, as in way better. 
I got banned from MGTOW because I asked if they were banning people just like the feminists at FDS that want to control free thought and speech. It was embarrassing to know that the mods at MGTOW were not like us men that have gone our way."
1932,Friendly-Casper,"Word of advice, quit using dating apps.  They're a pox upon society and the people who came up with them should be met with a short stop at the end of a long rope.  I'd also avoid even so much as looking at the OG Mgtow.  How that section has managed to not end up quarantined or banned yet is just a slight bit confusing."
1933,ausgamer529,Not all women are bad. Alot of them that I work with at my job are okay people hell even a few O consider freinds. But there are always ones who you should identify and avoid like the plague. The ones who will ruin someones career just for fun
1934,Yasai101,"Mgtow is just that, going YOUR own way. Whatever that might be."
1935,TheMF-J,Yes it is and I agree with every word you said.  You’ll find this a likeminded place
1936,themightyJG,"i want to believe nawalt, sadly i never met a woman that wasnt like the females they describe on mgtow1 at least at some level."
1937,stephenkodampuly666,"Everyone are not feminazis. Only a few powerful people are feminazis, they are making all the problems in the society. But How many woman did we see fighting against them or speaking against them in public? Little to rare. Maybe they won't know about these things, Who knows? Even if they knew, there is no guarantees that they will speak against it in public. Because whatever these minority feminazis are doing are beneficial for vast majority of the woman. They might say this is a bad situation in a private conversation, that will definitely make them look like an innocent person. Since we rarely see woman speak up against modern feminism, we have to believe that they are content with all these. When woman were not content, they started feminism."
1938,Germantaffer,"In the moment I entered mgtow1 I see the room full of hate, harsh verdicts and was really badly surprised. I think we have really to renegiotate the role models and the modern feminism, that wants to pressure both genders in new negative role models, 
I understand hate, sometimey I feel hate too, but it's not useful. The idea of lying moribund in my bed looking back in my  life and realizing, that is full of hate is a sad idea."

1940,DojoKanojoCho5,Boom ^^
1941,M26PershingTank,"You would think they will understand female biology and learn to live with it. As long as you don't get involved with them romantically, life can still goes on easily. 
Hell I'm fine with being friendzoned since I still make them pay for their own food, movies etc. No romantic attachments. 



Mgtow1 is stuck in this never ending red pill rage. It's time for them to walk away and enjoy life. I understand women today aren't the house wives they're hyped up to be, but it's not a big deal. Go your own way."
1942,DonMelbourne,"> I don’t even believe that some of the people on MGTOW1 genuinely dislike ALL women either. The sub has become a place to aggressively express frustration in poor partners in the past with the name MGTOW attached to it.

I call it ""red pill rabies"", where someone expresses hyperbolic anger against women, and others support him, actually validating the person's anger. It isn't healthy. MGTOW is a positive statement for individual ownership. ""MGTOW is freedom"" is so true. That's why I like this sub. Now go, my brother, live your life and don't worry about MGTOW1 anymore!"
1943,Fobilas,"Exactly.  I imagine most people feel very protective of themselves after a horrible breakup.  They become cynical of the opposite sex. It's not displaying strength. They did not adapt as well as others to a common tragedy in life.  In this way, the mgtow1 mentality is a mental health problem. 

I think mgtow1 is legit hate/anger though. It's like how I hated rich kids growing up because some of them were mean to poor kids.  Or how I hate cops because I've seen them haul off good people into cages. I am hurt, and I want to sooth my vulnerability with hate. When I say stuff like, ""Cops are bastards,"" I'm not in denial that I'm expressing anger and hatred. I am NOT being misunderstood. I am making **dehumanizing generalizations** about a large group of people, and people will condemn me for thar behavior deservingly.

Although perhaps I'm tone policing. If someone is right, it's ad hom to say, ""u mad, bro?"""
1944,Doctor_Red_Pill,I think mgtow1 is fine. It’s a good place to vent. Although I would change the name to “Post-roasties” because it’s obvious the people there are still holding on to some baggage from bad relationships.
1945,lonewolfhistory,I think TFM kinda expresses it best. MGTOW is a path or cycle that begins in unadulterated hate and rage. I think many in mgtow1 are just in that part of the cycle. I just wish there was a sub for every state of the path
1946,inconspeakuous,"Everyone's just a sex addict anymore, goes for both men and women. Very hard to find a good relationship with the opposite sex, friend or girlfriend.

Hookup culture has peaked, and imo that's a very sad thing."
1947,Bl00_Berry,As someone who was banned.... I agree
1948,inconspeakuous,"I try over and over and somehow I keep breaking. what pissed me off most was that I messaged a girl on Tinder and she really led me on, all the way up until I jerked off to one of her pics (I was 30 days clean on nofap). Turns out she's just a camgirl trying to get a new customer.

I felt so empty.

No more girls until I straighten out my own life."
1949,inconspeakuous,"Women get away with all of that because of the halo effect that they hide behind. It's really not 100% their fault if you ask me. It's men's faults for being sex addicts and letting women step all over them. If their man denies them anything, they threaten him with sexual rejection.

I think I read somewhere that 75% of women turn down 90% of men just so they can try to get the 'perfect' man, which is 10% of men. I forget the numbers, but they're ballpark.

Tinder is a perfect example of that. I read on a social experiment that average-looking women get more likes and matches than above-average looking men. I tried it myself and put a stock photo of a decent looking girl on a fake account (just one pic, no bio and no other info) and got over 100 likes in a day then deleted it. I believe I'm a good looking guy (not a 9 or 10/10 by any means) and I have racked up about 30 likes in a month.

And then it's even more heartbreaking when I'm around girls who are always talking about how there are no good men around anymore. It really hurts, and it makes me question myself. I wish I could tell them that, but it would just make me look worse.


And that's what brought me here. I'm not ashamed to say that I'm tired of hurt feelings. I'm just going to go my own way until I figure my life out, and maybe even cross paths with someone who isn't perfect, but at least respects my values (doesn't have to agree) and treats me like a human being.

And hey, thanks for understanding both sides and thanks for reading."
1950,unknownmgtow,Don't feed the troll. Clearly is a woman.
1951,DangZagnut,"Are they?  Or are they reacting?

Male version of feminists ,so are they filled with billions of dollars of budgets and control over all media?

Name all the pro-male media."
1952,Fobilas,"Yes, you say they must accept the women's animal. I think they need to accept their own. They must think the evolutionary psych behavior attributed to males as more dignified, no? If they saw that ALL humans are animals with antisocial facets, they would not focus specifically on women.  They'd instead be on subreddits discussibg psychology or ethics or philosophy or current events or lit, just like everyone else that recognizes human flaws as universal and does not scapegoat one group of people.

. I don't need an incel like forum to express mgtow ideas. Dude I'm basically just against marriage, working slave jobs, and question how ofteb both partners actually *really really* want kids. Said right, that can be a topic for polite conversation anywhere!  It's not a conspiracy victimizing me.  It's social commentary. Everyone does it."
1953,fmanly,"> You would think they will understand female biology and learn to live with it. 

Most of them do, eventually.

> Mgtow1 is stuck in this never ending red pill rage.

/r/mgtow is a subreddit, not a person.  It doesn't learn anything.

Its individual contributors do.  They get past their rage, and then generally move on.  They might still participate on the sub, but with less of the rage-memes and so on.

However, every day thousands of new men are born into the world, and trained to be bluepilled.  Eventually many will become redpilled and will enter the rage phase.  Then they join /r/mgtow and many other subs.

There will always be more new MGTOW than experienced ones, because MGTOW is a growing group.  

You might feel like you're speaking into the void when you try to help them, but you're not.  You actually are helping people.  It is just that the people you help are quickly replaced by 100 others who still need your help.  You'll never be done if your goal is to redpill the world.  

Just be at peace with it.  Accept that there will always be a ton of new MGTOW who are raging.  Help those you're willing to help.  Realize you can't help them all, but most will eventually figure it out.

And of course people will judge MGTOW by the vocal ragers.  Who cares..."
1954,MyLittlePonyofDoom,"> where someone expresses hyperbolic anger against women, and others support him, actually validating the person's anger.

There are a lot of other resources out there like HuMan who offer a more thoughtful interpretation and way forward after the rage phrase.

1958,TheSilverShade,"Being subscribed to both subs for a while, though I find MGTOW2, more positive but I swear people here love to hate on MGTOW1. 

It's like they don't know most people who joins the sub, just woke up  to the lies they've been fed since childhood. When you've realized that everything you believed is a myth. 

You're not going to be all smiles after breakups, a divorce and such of course you're going to see through the lines and such but does that really mean they're anti-woman? 

As I said before :
Calling women on their shit = / = women hating .

It also goes with reddit's agenda.

Women can literally suggest stealing and hurting men. No one bats an eye. 

MGTOWs just shun and avoid women, advise against dating and the manipulate tactics. ""Oh no that's illegal now"""
1959,michaelklr,"You make no sense. I’m saying the MGTOW mods and members do not think like the majority of MGTOW males.

I get it. It's a funny picture. 

But funny pictures, memes, and all that detract from the point of this sub. Which is more for discussion of independant male life through mgtow as an applied lifestyle choice.

Usually what happens with pictures like this is you end up with low-effort comments, and a bunch of ""hur-dur wahmens"" comments start popping up which makes more work for the mod team. 

Pictures like this would be better off being posted on mgtow1, which does allow for more of the meaning and images.

MGTOW has unfortunately always been seemingly dominated by boneheaded right wing Americans with little political education beyond a single fetid corporate news source. They're all for displaying their superior alpha masculinity for having 'moved off the plantation"" but point out out that right wing politics is nothing more than obedience to authoritarian institutions, debt servitude and flag waving group think etc and the hive pile on. They can't handle it.

And now out-and-out fascist sympathizers are welcomed to the fold. I guess that's no surprise given the amount of 'white genocide' retards that lurk there.

You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.

> Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.

> As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically


That post is freaking weird and creepy. My response:


> This is some weird creepy pedo shit. What are you going to do? Have sex with her yourself. As long as she makes you proud and does great in life, who really cares? Yeah she is gonna have sex, as long as she respects herself, who cares? Would it bother you if she waited till marriage too? Or is the thought of your daughter ever having a boyfriend/husband to difficult for you.

> For me, as long as she does not turn out to be a loser, being passed around by a bunch of losers, marries a great guy and does well in life, it is not too much of my business.

> This obsessing over your child's vagina is weird and creepy.

Sounds like the dude wants to ravage his daughter or is bothered about her ever having sex, even if it is her husband. Anyone that talks about his daughter's 'tight pussy' has some serious issues. That post is weird beyond belief."
2054,,"not banned but I realized how toxic and hateful a lot of the dudes there are, people suck, sadly sometimes people you date or marry are shit, and if you decide to focus on yourself I'm all for that

the difference being actually 'going your own way', not posting about how trash women were to you every day and living in an echo chamber

2091,MuleFool42,"I just got banned. I'm actually not sure why. I did comment on a post that harboring hate is not healthy. That hating shows that you care, that hating gives power to the other person to use against you. Then I got banned. At least, that's what I think it was for. I am waiting for them to tell me what I did wrong.

[Edit] I actually told them that I didn't care why I was banned. Then I un-joined. They don't seem to be able to tolerate different points of view. I guess they're just like woke SJWs that get triggered easily."

2098,Factor13th,"I am about to just leave mgtow1because guys there act like they cuckedtow. They believe you an mra because you simply make the piint that a lazy mgtow that just watches the world burn.. Is just as bad as a femnist.

For a group about men they sure do act beta."
2099,thoughtOG83,"What I do not understand is why so many MGTOW's mock women for having cats, when so many MGTOW's post pictures of themselves with dogs.

And hating women is just nonsensical.

One can be wary of them, yes.

But to hate women is to hate life, especially if ostensibly you're a heterosexual.

I wasn't banned, but I could tell that it was very echo chamber- esque.

MGTOW was originally about protecting oneself during a divorce.

They have posts with FGTOW's (fakes going their own way) decrying their own sisters, like they are going to be accused of incest or something.

That shit be weird."

2108,rhamnouse,"RANT begins..
I have been permanently banned from r/MGTOW for no reason and without any explanation. The one place where you could talk like a free man and add value without the fear of someone shutting you down. Or so I thought. The mods have chosen to hide behind their screens and not respond after repeated requests to give a reason. I went back and saw my activity to see what might've triggered the ban although I've not violated a single rule. I might've answered questions meant for ladies in some other subs and interacted with different kinds of people, none of which is a reason to ban. Why I'm so disappointed with this particular ban is that MGTOW is a good forum for men to develop self-respect and develop their personalities independent of their SMV, to rid themselves of societal baggage. This ban has thrown all that to the dogs and made me question if a good part of its members are really cucks who just want to have the feminazi experience because they are deprived of it elsewhere...

I can post any of the links from my comment here if anyone wants.

Because the guy with ""mgtow"" flair really gave off extremely strong /r/mgtow vibes and he made ""meme"" remarks entirely unrelated to the topic at hand.

2182,,[removed]
2183,5fingerdiscounts,Why mgtow banning people?
2184,debanked,"Yes banned. No idea why, whatever

I had got out most of my redpill rage, so I guess they sent me on my way"
2185,,"So wow, I can't believe I just got banned from r/MGTOW. I thought I was one of their brothers. I loved the content that was posted. I didn't see it as hateful at all. I saw it as frustrated and hurt red pilled men who needed to vent. All was well until I notice some of my comments were getting no activity, so I made this post.

>I have been suspicious of any posts or comments I make that have no activity, so I asked one of the members to try to look at any of my posts or comments that stay at 1 karma. More and more recently, my comments are missing and my posts are removed without explanation. When I attempt to contact mods, I get ignored. Mods, if you have a problem with me, talk to me. Don't ignore me. If you are overwhelmed with mod stuff, get more mods to help. It's really irritating to try to participate in a sub when my stuff gets randomly removed for no reason.

When that post was deleted, I pressed the mods for an explanation and I got banned. If they really don't want to deal with people or the stress of moderating a sub, they should step down as mods. Just removing submissions and comments without explanation is an unacceptable way to run a forum regardless of the subject of the forum."
2186,Sepinde,"Got banned for advocating letting men go their own way, even if that way isn't away from women"
2187,,Got banned for saying that you could meet the one early in life if you get lucky and they somehow thought I was white knighting even though i was just being optimistic
2188,,"Well, here I'm... Obviously I got perma-banned without any reason that I may know, still waiting for the response.  
It just got me by surprise."
2189,Anthony_Fellowlin,Got banned for questioning an incel
2190,Buckeye44302,Not sure why I got banned.  It was a thread where guys were being keyboard warriors and really ripping on women.  Didn't defend the women so much as tried to get them to see a bit of perspective.  Always thought going your own way meant not caring what women said or did and you just focus on doing things you want to do.
2191,RT-AC66U,Yep
2192,Matiyah,"I just got banned five minutes ago for making a dark joke about a certain female who posted some crap which was posted on the sub.  Apparently, that's considered threatening.  Even though said rule isnt listed on the community page at all but can be found if you attempt to message the mods.  I think they do that for plausible deniability.

While reading their rules the hypocrisy is kind of stunning.  The whole philosophy is about freedom yet enforcing those rules means that people with a different opinion on social issues wont be able to post there.  \*Confused Jackie Chan\*"
2193,Natty-Not-Guilty,got banned for saying getting the snip is beta
2194,themightyJG,i was banned for no apparent reason.
2195,OverlordWhiteWolf,Banned for...something. I honestly don’t know. I wasn’t given a reason. Replied to the ban message twice and messaged one of the mods. No reply.
2196,TheDemonWhoComes,wasnt banned but what's wrong with the original mgtow?
2197,lost-icon,I got banned from the 'witchcraft women against patriarchy' sub. Must've touched a nerve.
2198,Sandman10372,"I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure this comment got me banned by whatever tradcon misogynist pussy is running the show over there now.

""These comments prove that a bunch of you guys have a stick up your ass and are opposed to people having fun. If you guys approach women with 1/10th the vitriol you display in the comments, you're never going to get laid, much less by multiple women at one time...poor bastards."""
2199,stronzorello,Self banned because of nazism. One suggested I read the Talmud to understand Jewish greed and malice. I’m Jewish.
2200,nla6219,"I got banned for saying Islam was right (for the most part) about women.
when you allow women to run rampant with no supervision and no social or legal consequences for degenerate behavior feminism, promiscuity and other forms of degeneracy are the result. Thats all i said and i got banned. I would think thats common sense but i guess not."
2201,nla6219,This MGTOW sub is far better so far. Refreshing to find a place where my speech wont be censored
2202,StBlops2cel_is_Lord,Cunts just banned me...no warning or explanation. I hope they all get chlamydia from a diseased hooker.
2203,AlanTheGr8,Cucktows and MINOs
2204,kittynovalove,Omg 😳
2205,kittynovalove,Post post!
2206,Careful_Description,"Hey coming from mgtow1. many of us had our suspicions about the infil, but nothing supporting it. anything you may know?"
2207,MODS_TOUCH_BOYS,It is U/ Thatcard. Pretty sure he was inserted by reddit admins.
2208,,Same thing happened to me the other day. It's really woken me up on the true nature of that sub
2209,Ferg_NZ,"I was exactly the same.   They called it ""concern trolling"" when I said they could do better than hating on women with gratuitous posts."
2210,E_T_0629,"Yeah. Because they think that the only way for a man to go on his fucking way is to sit around and post threads on a forum about how you hate women, instead of just visiting cool places, and befriending people regardless of their gender."
2211,Toshiba1point0,omg...sorry thats ridiculous
2212,dazed111,That's funny
2213,AlanTheGr8,Now u know the answer is yea
2214,JihadNinjaCowboy,"I am honestly curious as to what percentage of them are newly red-pilled and how many of them are dysfunctionally stuck in ""red-pill rage"".

Red-pill rage is supposed to only be a stage you go through."
2215,Jamie850,Same here. It's like a woman is the moderator.
2216,Factor13th,Yes they are i joined like a day or so ago and im already wanting to leave the place.
2217,ac714,"It’s possible they actually agreed with you and the ban was to prove you both right and wrong at the same time.

Schrodinger’s bam."
2218,Ferteqw2,that's in their rules. no lgbt shit. hate those cunts.
2219,darkrood,MGTOW mod: believe in biology of female brain until biology mentions gay people.
2220,typicalgoatfarmer,Being bi and MGTOW is the best. I’m having a hard time balancing atm because there’s intimacy and passion everywhere.
2221,AlanTheGr8,"Really its a game to make MGTOW appear to be villains to discredit mgtow..just like voat is a psyop to ""prove"" how much we luvz Big Bruh Weddit"
2222,Fylix_Aerou,"Did you make a post or just a comment? As someone who's also cut from the same cloth, I'm curious to know. 

MGTOW and bi as well. Understandably men are far less judgemental and psychotic and make great partners, so I totally feel you."
2223,MuleFool42,"It's a terrible sub. I was there because I believe that MGTOW is important for all men, especially young men just starting out. But they require racism, sexism, and overall bigotry. No thanks. This is a much better sub and I hope that the majority of MGTOW migrate to this sub."
2224,monk2019,">Agree, mgtow should not be political or strive to be it, it should be a platform to provide information to those who seek it. Not one to advocate for trump/hillary/whatever politician or similar stuff."
2225,pedanticpterodactyl,Nobody is more obsessed with Chad than incels!
2226,DJDickJob,"Yeah I got banned for agreeing with someone that the sub had suddenly become sexist as fuck, and pointing out that it happened immediately after r/incels got shut down. Coincidence? I don't think so."
2227,trueliberal1,This actually explains a lot.
2228,Abdul_Alhazred_,"It's ok to hit them, but only if it's in self defense and if your physical integrity is at risk."
2229,ac714,Can you share the thread with me?
2230,poopiedoodie710,Lmfao me too - asked the dudes over there what made them go MGTOW and basically got half-assed answers and bunk science about how men are superior to women.
2231,ViolentJenniferLopez,"Seriously. ""Enjoy this photo of my hike"" above ""Woman cuts her son's dick off to spite her dad."" It's like a zen garden full of broken glass."
2232,IntellegoTheTrue1,Men hiking their own way
2233,darkrood,Maybe the mountain you posted was too trigerring
2234,Azuzu88,"Yeah, I just got banned for calling out a holocaust denier. I had also noticed a real slide down in to women-hating posts and very little about actually going your own way. Seems it is very much the new r/incels."
2235,MuleFool42,"I agree because I thought that's where the most like minded people were for me, but they are actually just a hate group. I think MGTOW is important for men, all men, and that ultimately it has to do with investing one one's self. It's not about hate. 

They will never get out of their own prison. Thank goodness for this sub instead."
2236,MuleFool42,Nobody will reply. The mods are just as spineless as the members of that sub.
2237,,I’ve just been banned for making this exact comparison; between feminists and MGTOW.
2238,AlanTheGr8,"Yesh they has landed. The pro hillary wants to be homosexual but still cant get inshills haz landed.

I got banned from pussypassdenied simply by making a joke that sub is like cat videos of crazy women. They r like.....wut???????? Still dont get it. No humor and memes are as close 2 reading as they get."
2239,DangZagnut,Sounds like he was a total asshole.
2240,AlanTheGr8,Is allowed here or not?
2241,Hando-jin,So they proved your point then. Almost worth the ban!
2242,Zauberspitze,"I literally got banned for clarifying that a 'left wing conservatist' is a National Socialist. They rather have a problem with logic, but not with 'right-wing boneheads'"
2243,MetaCognitio,I got banned from /r/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen for telling some guy that obsessing over a husband/boyfriend fucking his daughters 'tight pussy' was weird and creepy. Hey thought this was being cucked. WTF?
2244,DirtieHarry,">because I am gay my opinion doesn’t matter in MGTOW.

Maybe at r/mgtow , but your opinion should definitely matter!"
2245,DyingSociety,I hope you are joking...
2246,WhydidIevenreply,that's a copypasta from last year lol
2247,Isitnecessary667,Some of the posts on wherearethegoodmen don’t even look like crazy bitches. They just look like normal people trying to put their best foot forward
2248,,Trolled
2249,AlanTheGr8,"I liked this one better...

Your daughter wants to slut it up and catch a beta on the downward slide.   


Respecto-boy will NEVER get 'her best', emotion/love/lust/pussy/asshole/tits-wise, but McThuggins is gonna blast his gangsta seed up in her cunt raw and call her a slut while he slaps her. Respecto-boy will 'luck out' later when he signs on to her shitshow for a chance at some boring, condom'ed, purely missionary-style bi-monthly access to her haggered out hairy Arby's roast beef bun, overproofed pizza dough ass, and sagging 'tiger striped' dangle-melons...   


You should have taken the lead a LONG, long time ago instead of letting wifey turn your daughters into young cum-guzzling fucktoy mercenaries that bring ruin to our society. She's a fucktoy now, you can't remove the many, many gangsta-ass dicks she's ridden from her soul, and she's eternally pairbound to some random piece of shit thug life asshole. Mocha Latte Bebbies will be coming soon, and Grampa gonna have to pony up 'cause McThuggins ain't payin' shit bitch."
2250,weasted_,"Oml, did you report that guy?"
2251,GreatWallOfDeath,"I got banned for posting a fucking joke about farting in some girls face, A JOKE, I wasn't serious, and some guy in the forum called me an abuser for that and other called me trash? It was just a joke. I know it was immature, but so are they."
2252,PhoenixRising-MGTOW,Definitely. I haven’t been banned but I clearly see the same thing you do. Loads of female trolls on MGTOW posting Incel type BS to try to discredit the movement. I just ignore them and keep posting and participating. I work with 99% women so I can see their BS from a mile away
2253,,[deleted]
2254,,[deleted]
2255,,"Crazy you mention that. I was actually considering making one. I still think some of the men here have a narrow outlook on life, but I am not against the idea of men working on themselves (that will help with the ladies btw. I figured it could take a bunch of MGTOWs posts and debunk them."
2256,dr_matthew,There is one: it's r/XY_Chromosomes. You can join this subreddit. The mods are more compassionate than the ones at the MGTOW subreddit
2257,YubYubNubNub,"I was banned also, without explanation of any kind. I asked why and had no response.  Very odd and crappy."
2258,simplisticallysimple,"Time and place for everything.

This is the sub for men who've graduated from all that ""woman nature"" stuff."
2259,DevilSweets,"Of course not.


There are always two sides of every coin:


One side is the MGTOW sub reddit that have been infested with cuck mods who will ban you for anything that's not against the rules cuz of feefees.


And the other side is this sub that want to ignore female nature and hypergamy by overloading the sub with other subjects....as if they you to forget the main catalyst for why men went MGTOW in the first place.



The only ""safe place"" that you can't get banned from is YouTube. Peace brother."
2260,Mercyz89,Just got banned as well for no reason lol. They got feminist mods over there?
2261,Matiyah,Echo chamber mindset would be my guess
2262,gielrebel,xDDDD
2263,Trek13,"I posted there for over two years.   Banned twice, both times for responding to idiotic political MAGAt posts and daring to criticize ""dear Leader"" (fucking Trump).    No moderator explained this to me but it was pretty clear.

Lot of freepers over there (Free Republic knuckle draggers)."
2264,Shnook82,I've been banned and unbanned a few days later.  Doesn't look like it happens often.
2265,,[removed]
2266,modsarecunts889,"femimarxist, i cringe every time you retards call them nazis"
2267,theanchorman05,No not at all.  Actually a lot of us were banned from MGTOW for no reason and when asked why we  were banned we were given no reason.
2268,AlanTheGr8,Tingles
2269,Ferg_NZ,Sensitive souls aren't they?
2270,GSV-ZeroGravitas,Can reddit award you a posthumous gold for breaking a record?😆
2271,loveboner,"Same here, they are quick on the button."
2272,,Can you PM me the link of those threads?
2273,former_farmer,I think at least one mod is homophobic.
2274,Whirrlz,Same
2275,Centralredditfan,"Not only that, but now they have posts about little kids there as well. Hating on women is bad, but attacking little kids just because they don't share the subreddits views on climate change?"
2276,The-Deviant-One,"There is a good reason for some of us who were posting photography. I can't speak for the guys who were just googling nice shots and posting them, dunno WTF that's about. But there's so much negativity over there. Sulking and stories of guys getting hammered on by life and society. I'm actually doing really well which is why I started posting my personal photography there. Along with snippets of little successes I'm having in my life. Life is hard, MTGOW can seem daunting to new comers and guys down on their luck. I wanted to show that you can straighten your shit up and have a good time and thing's end up positively for MGTOW guys."
2277,Loban8990,Join the club dude. Banned. I messaged the mods and silence. They won't even tell me what I did.
2278,FlintAustin,"I kept writing every few days and eventually got a reply regarding a post being 'low effort'.

I think one or two mods there have a woman in their life who goes on a troll rampage now and then."
2279,xxMeccxx,Same lol I made sarcastic posts but they didn't like it at all
2280,,I do need someone like that!!
2281,MuleFool42,Totally agree. They get triggered easily.
2282,MuleFool42,"Which is fine with me. r/MGTOW is a place for children who are in a suspended stage of development. Screw that. 

MGTOW is so much more. The rejection of hate should be part of it, as well as the intense focus on self around personal, professional, physical, financial, mental, emotional, and spiritual goals. 

It really should not be a hate group, which is what r/MGTOW is intent on being. 

What a bunch of fucking losers."
2283,,[deleted]
2284,justAcuriousDalek,Funny. Cos I think we have the same goal. Autonomy
2285,,I got banned for “concern trolling” as well. Apparently that means that you are pretending to be on the side of MGTOW when you really aren’t. How they determine that someone is a concern troll is beyond me
2286,itriedbut,Merely getting a reason for why you were banned Is actually amazing. I got nothing.
2287,screamifyouredriving,It's been taken over by incels.
2288,alamsohel1990,maybe someone close to you is a moderator and he doesnt want to know what shit is going on in your mind.
2289,Flip_Angelo,It’s a ironic that a sub about going your own way has become a hivemind
2290,thoughtOG83,"How was this downvoted?  


Even once?"
2291,donkeynique,"And then to come in here and see people saying the problem with the sub is clearly feminist infiltration or that the mods are cucks... Nah man. If that is a MGTOW's best guess on why the sub is toxic, the sub is just toxic MGTOW. No infiltration needed."
2292,n00bRECON_BR,"I can agree with that there are many FGTOW, but the mocking over woman with cats is just a stereotype kind of joke (i guess), it means that woman with cats are so desesperated for atention cuz they cant get laid (or something like that) so they use that stereotype to use as an argument. MGTOW posts pictures of them with dogs cuz it is popular belif that dogs are the most loyal living creature to a man. Than they also use that as an argument to prove that dogs are more loyal than the average modern woman. I hope I helped you."
2293,GazingIntotheAbyss1,"I think there is a law of the universe that every group eventually descends into a collective circle jerk. The mark of wisdom is to know when to move on, and to not be to attached so one is able to move on when that time arrives"
2294,ryanshedy,They closed incel subs so it looks like you got the toxic parts of it when they switched
2295,bahgahz,I definitely prefer MGTOW2. The quality of posts are alot better.

Way too much racism coming from that camp."
2300,cursed_deity,"one of the mods is absolutely insane.

i got banned twice already but im staying out now, who wants to walk on eggshells all day long as to not anger the mod, he's like an unhappy married woman, the irony lol"
2301,IntellegoTheTrue1,"I am so in line with your post brother. If we get put at the door,  we will move away and go our own way. We don't depend on them and bashing their own loyal members will be their own demise."
2302,The-Deviant-One,"Same. Been active and in good standing for a very long time. Banned, no warning, no response, no rules broken."
2303,julianleung,So we have a 2.
2304,T0000009,"Got banned with no warning, no explanation, with no response from the ""mods"" and I was there back when the place started"
2305,The-Deviant-One,"Their ban-hammer message say to reply back to the message if you have questions, but they never reply. Makes me think they have a very active rogue admin who is banning people outside of the listed rules and deleting messages from users asking why."
2306,The-Deviant-One,"No reason given and no response when you follow their directions to 'reply to the message for clarification' either, right?"
2307,wsmith79,Yep.  It’s been highjacked by political agents and apparently they have mod support
2308,DJDickJob,"That's because from his perspective, to be a 5+ she has to have a dick."
2309,MetaCognitio,That makes no sense since ?/10 is a relative scale.
2310,millionmilecummins,"It is a thread where men come to talk with other men about their life, cars, women, kids, jobs and the million other issues they face in life. It’s one of a very few places that men can be open, and receive feedback from other men, who’ve probably had similar experiences. We don’t all agree with each, but we get it. Some men have been through more than words could ever express in this thread. I’ve personally visited one of the women’s thread here, very clear about men not posting there. I get it. I believe you meant no harm, but deciding to remove a hornets nest in your porch is synonymous with attempting to reason with some of us. We need a place of our own to bitch and moan amongst our own. In closing, it’s what MGTOW2 a legit sub."
2311,Attorney-on-FIRE,Wow. That’s weird. Must be more to story?
2312,Platinum247365,Wow that is messed up.
2313,Loban8990,Dude. Same this here. Ive been a member there for a year and all of a sudden I go randomly banned. Not explanation of what I did just banned and no response from my messages to the mods.
2314,,"Yeah man, its a fucking conspiracy, lmao"
2315,ScuzzleButte,"I got banned from that sub too, I compared them to incels for putting up a decent tinder profile. I think she was still hot, over 30, and no kids, so someone I would swipe right on."
2316,clapas,"If the obvious answer is yes, then why you ask?"
2317,DiccDucc,"Yo, what's up! I'm pretty sure the comment that got me banned was a reply to your, lol. What's going on?

Though it seems like you're not shadow-banned anymore, nice!"
2318,,What a bunch of cucks. I can't believe they banned you for that.
2319,,lol. no you didn't. they'd make you their king
2320,unblackmailable,"For that, you will get banned here as well.... it's still the public domain."
2321,debanked,"Dude, problem is you're too 'grounded'"
2322,MarzMonkey,"Shiiiiet, this problem must be worse than I thought; I got banned too despite it literally being the subreddit I have the most comment karma in.

Half the mod team are dead, the rest must be cucked retards."
2323,Sepinde,That one is back?
2324,kittynovalove,"Thank you! I’m honestly all for men’s rights but I get slammed a lot and called a cunt, whore, liar, you name it! And I get hate from both feminists AND MGTOW. Like, how do we expect to move forward as a society to fix these issues if we hate each other?"
2325,,[deleted]
2326,cursedhuntsman,"Yeah they banned me for making a sarcastic comment. Some dude posted a picture of some hideous looking food and i said "" You need a woman to cook for you /s"""
2327,FlintAustin,"I been banned like 5 times.

I had created a few accounts down the road to keep my daily red pills since I don't use Reddit for much else.

However, this time around I am pretty sure being in a mgtow sub where you feel like walking on eggshells like a relationship with a woman is last thing I want.

Fuck them."
2328,FlintAustin,"Yup you are not alone man. As you clearly see here lol.

There has been something fishy since last year. I was shadow banned for about 2 weeks. Then I was banned for 'low effort' post and unbanned once I wrote them about 5-6 times.

Again banned again lol.

I think they are too concerned about not being perceived a certain way.

Basically bashing females is encouraged and seems to be a hard lean on male-victim narrative. More like a systematic way to impress young minds but censor experienced men who see the grey than just black and white."
2329,Impossible-asset,"Uh, Wat ?"
2330,MODS_TOUCH_BOYS,"You shouldn't want to go back. 

&#x200B;

Or just make a new account?"
2331,30203forever,So how come you're still able to post here? A miracle?
2332,Solid_Gold_Turd,Unbanned? Does such a thing even happen over there?
2333,Impossible-asset,"Correct, because people havent stopped being banned from there without any reason. And they still post here in the main forum, which then gets clogged with posts on the subject. So that's why there is another thread."
2334,Impossible-asset,Comment removed: trolling or incomprehensible nonsense.
2335,Dr-Dickbutt69,Probably won't get one
2336,Impossible-asset,Comment removed: nope. Nope nope. No links to murder anything from this sub.

But the last sentence is correct."
2342,Matiyah,Hypocritical enforcement of the rules for one.  Claim to be free speech and all for liberty but bans anyone who even gives off a slight hint of being liberal.
2343,Sandman10372,It's been taken over by tradcon cunt rags who came over when the incel subs got shut down.
2344,screamifyouredriving,Just read the posts you don't need any proof other than that.
2345,PoseidonLordoftheSea,"Same here, man. I didn’t realize how toxic it was until it tried to drag me even deeper. I’m glad I’m thinking much healthier thoughts these days. It’s hard to feel happy when you’re carrying around hatred for an entire gender"
2346,PoseidonLordoftheSea,They’re a hive mind
2347,,"If there was a woman moderating, why would she do that? I think it's more likely some easily insulted dude."
2348,WolverineDLogan,Or an incel
2349,Aesael_Eiralol,"I messaged them a few times asking to at least tell me why I was banned and never got a response.  Honestly might have helped me get over the hump of the last of my RP rage, but it still sucks to not be able to comment occasionally."
2350,JihadNinjaCowboy,That's pretty meta.
2351,ausgamer529,I made a post and was banned a half our later. Asked why and they said gay men aren't real men
2352,fromo_latte,Or if it’s a biological man identifying as a woman... that’s fair game.
2353,Toshiba1point0,I would but its been way too long.
2354,Azuzu88,"Yeah, a lot of incels and woman-haters seemed to have joined the group. I miss the days when it was guys bonding through shared stories of why the went MGTOW and what they're up to."

30 upvotes. I got 4 downvotes. 

Dude talking about his daughter's 'tight pussy' or her getting 'fucked in every hole' 🤮

When I told the mod he should be ashamed of having that post on the sub, they were actually ashamed of my 'virtue signalling' response."

^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37)"
2364,MetaCognitio,I was the one that got banned for calling him out!
2365,MelodicBrush,"That's my point. Exactly the same happened to me. I only said that my gf seems to be an exception. Boom ban. They want to make the sub into a hate sub an nothing else, so that they can discredit MGTOW as just being men that want all women dead or something."
2366,GoatKnows,"Well I will say this when there is over a 90% chance you will interact with a womanbin some form and you demand that there is 100% no reason to talk about it as though it doesn't exist you are setting men up to fail. Because your mail, your Uber driver, your public transportation ride, & much more will include women. And all it takes is one slip up to arm her with the key to destroying you"
2367,the_milk_is_back,"I get that. But to be MGTOW is to acknowledge certain things regarding society and women. But to dwell on it is simply NOT going one's own way. And to be so rigid in judging people is just a miserable way to live life.

In my experience the padawans like posts such as ""look at this post-wall thot looking for a simp orbiter beta provider"".

The masters like ""I'm learning to truly enjoy life being single and here's this car I'm restoring"" or ""me and my friend on the lake at sunrise going fishing""

The rage stage is real, but life is so much better when you leave it behind."
2368,haagendaas,Yeah one of those guys called me a “fake MGTOW” all because I “only” refused to do hookups and came into relationships cautiously because I knew the dangers
2369,GoatKnows,"My brother to me I understand if it's hate speach their will be threats of violence but the truth is MGTOW & GYOW is about avoiding women & staying in your goal. And to avoid reminding men about a danger that is in their instinct to come help that's only a trap. For example a woman & her kids are stuck on the road, & a man helps without knowing that he set himself up for the woman to lie that he tried to rape her in front of her kids, just so she can get attention. MGTOW needs to keep that fear of contact with the modern American women who for attention will not only weaponize herself but her bastard children. We men already know how to deal with one another it's that danger of wanting to be honorable & helpful that women prey on & it's something we have to fight against every moment. Oh a women can't lift her package tried to help accused of stealing, oh a woman bumped into a you she fell you tried to help claims you touched her inappropriately. 

Yes by being MGTOW & GYOW we declared victory & freedom, but our guard must stay up as all times not against women but our own nature that will lead us to helping them."
2370,passsingstrange,They are angreerrry
2371,kayfab,"Yeah this is kind of weird, this is why i never follow religion nor politics."
2372,AlanTheGr8,People should be free to pro anti trump everywhere and not banbed for it unless its trolling etc. Free speach isbunkown to most of reddit and trp is quarantined but incest and dogsex subs r not..insanity
2373,kayfab,completely stupid ban and unbanned what ever happen to freedom of speech now there are a zillion rules to follow or you get banned before posting.....
2374,kayfab,Sorry to offend you fatty
2375,Svartanatten,It's all socialism?
2376,AlanTheGr8,"I swear that MensRights and MGTOW are stealth channels that is  are psyops. There are lots of silly mods there,  that may or not be women, and the goal may be to give the appearance of free speach while shadow banning all posts that hit close to home or are too dangerous and truthful.

&#x200B;

It would be too obvious to outright ban ALL male speach so it gives them plausable deniablility and cover.

&#x200B;

Also many of the mods may be easily triggered, have a bad life, general mean trolls, etc.

&#x200B;

I think a lot of reddit, like IRC, and early internet, people camped out or bought names of channels/domains so that they could control them.

&#x200B;

For instance it wouldn't surprise me at all if a Woman  were to start a channel called MGTOW to monitor and control all thought that goes through there.

&#x200B;

Heck, men could run some feminist channels. Wouldn't that be funny. Laff"
2377,Yonisensei18,"Damn, same exact time happened to me"
2378,Yonisensei18,"At this point, I have already stopped trying"
2379,tegs98,Yeah
2380,DiccDucc,"Right. I commented on a post in where a couple were both acting like children, and was neither on the man's side, or the woman's side. I wrote about how both of them were immature, and how neither should be in a relationship before they mature a little bit more.   


Then I got called an anti-male cuck (for calling both people in the couple assholes) and banned. 

&#x200B;

Yikes."
2381,gielrebel,didn't catch your drift here mate.
2382,veronikuh,That’s exactly what I said! It is the same goal! Feminism allowed me to define myself apart from my relationship to men. And MGTOW allows men to define themselves apart from their relationship to women. I think it’s awesome for everyone to do that. And I’m glad this group aims to do that without conflating it with viewing women as the enemy. Cheers. Solidarity brothers.
2383,Ferg_NZ,">How they determine that someone is a concern troll is beyond me

I agree.  I think ""concern trolling"" is a bullshit way of deflecting from an issue.  Concern trolling doesn't exist outside of reddit."
2384,Factor13th,Seems like they most have lol Mgtow doesnt need a leader they all gotta learn to stand on their own two feet and learn to fight.. No point in bitching if they wont do anything about it.
2385,Factor13th,"To be honest I wouldnt give a shit. I am always honest and wont be shut up whether people, ban, kick, beat me up, or kill me. No point in complaining and not doing anything.

While feminist and betas kep destroying our lives in society."
2386,Factor13th,I got banned for making points on why it's a movement and for disrespecting someone who was acting stupid with me lol
2387,AlanTheGr8,Not all
2388,pwandapop,How? They banned me for saying something they didn’t like and I think that’s toxic and shouldn’t be encouraged.
2389,pwandapop,I got banned for saying you shouldn’t say all women are sick fucks
2390,krugerand9,i suspect a feminist has covertly broken into the mods club over there.
2391,IntellegoTheTrue1,He must be the same incel he swore to kick off r/MGTOW. Ugh
2392,The-Deviant-One,"Same. Been active and in good standing for a very long time. Banned, no warning, no response."
2393,T0000009,"That's my guess.

A Commie fag or feminist cunt infiltrator is doing it."
2394,ZombiNawhal,"Bingo! Part of me wonders if they have a secret idealog Moderator that they don't know about? How could they be so wilfully closed minded?

It boggles the mind."
2395,Untowardopinions,Jfc the persecution complex.  Literally ALL OF REDDIT is men talking to men about their hobbies.  You just also want to drop in “and women fucking suck” somewhere you won’t get called an incel for it.
2396,cmdralpha,That exactly what happened to me just unsubscribe cause there is no point anymore
2397,double-happiness,"Well, what's your explanation then? Why are they being so censorious when that's so much against MGTOW philosophy?"
2398,AlanTheGr8,"Why? What is the preffered word for homosexual these days? Ppl get so butthurt and keep changing the preferred words... Unless the intent is bad the word isnt bad. Black, colored, gay, whatever.

They hate themselves so they ban u. Same with that story of woman who bans if u say female.

Its a crazy world of everyonevis king of their microbubble. Oh king! Ban! Im a queen! Ban! Dont assume my gender! They are just looking to make others miserable.

And it spills into the real world... It was busy at the gas station pumps and i waited and i finally started pulling into one and someone else who had just got their literally went ape shit and cursing me late 40s asshat acting like 5yr old.

So Im like u want 2 fight bro? And hea like yeah get out of ur car! So I start 2 video him and he fled... What a mighty wuss crybaby. 

The mods are like him x10 -20, years"
2399,BeckyLynchIsBetter,"I think it's stupid, but okay. Thanks for letting me know, btw."
2400,,you're joking. will you seriously get banned for that here?
2401,GSV-ZeroGravitas,"Well balanced and sensible? I've been called some atrocious things in my time, but never that!!🤣"
2402,,"tbf MGTOW isn't a movement, they don't want to fix anything."
2403,krugerand9,"we don't move forward.

 Isnt that obvious to you? 

Guess not because you have a woman's brain."
2404,,"Seriously, it's almost like they are trying to give the movement a bad name and get it banned from Reddit. I can't say I blame the rest of the world for assuming we're just a bunch of bitter incels when the men who are supposedly ""going their own way"" literally just obsessively talk about women and nothing else."
2405,IntellegoTheTrue1,"Learning how to deal with people the best way possible is not niceism or blue pilled attitude, it's just a tool to save yourself from mental stress and useless conflict. Lately I learned the value of it, I think it should be a staple of MGTOW to learn how to deal with people. Monk mode is just toxic and bad for self improvement, even if you have s job that doesn't require interaction much"
2406,DangZagnut,"I can't, /u/Impossible-asset banned me.  You don't see me posting do you?

It still doesn't answer the question why there isn't a ""banned from MGTOW2 mega thread""."
2407,theanchorman05,Don't talk logic with him. Just say something horrible about women and he'll go away.
2408,DespawnMe,Lol okie dokie
2409,Drayelya,"That is not the point of the ideology of MGTOW. MGTOW advocates for men deciding what way they want to go, even if that way isn’t in line with how other MGTOW think. The point is to offer/receive advice but, not to force your own personal idea of what MGTOW is down another man’s throat. This is why a lot of the monks have left the main MGTOW sub or even got banned for ridiculing how it’s members act."
2410,wathon2,"this.   Freedom of speech for me but not for thee. 

Sounds familiar,  sounds like feminism.   No wonder people equate MGTOW to feminism.  

The MODS over at MGTOW (if they are reading this comment) need to get their heads out of their asses and take a long look in the mirror."
2411,nla6219,"Im far from liberal, i oppose almost everything modern day liberals/leftists stand for. That being said and even being a Theocratic Distributist personally I believe in free speech for all whether i agree with you or not. The only laws that are legit are the original amendments in the U.S. constitution. Everything else has no validity. Any laws or policies that say you have no right to speech, privacy or armaments are unconstitutional, invalid and must be fought against. The internet is the new public sphere and free speech for all must be preserved and defended. (Including liberals Lol)"
2412,alamsohel1990,or an imbecile
2413,cursed_deity,"don't use their word, it's a shitty insult"
2414,Jamie850,Dumb sub that will ban you for any little thing.
2415,Fylix_Aerou,"Dude, *WHAT*? I've seen the topic touched on in comments with respect, but to see that from the main MGTOW sub boggles me. What an asshat.

I'm not sure if you watch TFM by chance, but he's addressed the topic before. Going your way isn't just about relationships, but a path to self actualization without the need for external validation. Gay men and bi men absolutely can be MGTOW."
2416,Fylix_Aerou,"Sorry for the second post, but I did want to show an example of something good I found from the subreddit.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/744lyd/gay_and_mgtow/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I'm so sorry that mod was a flaming shitbag. Keep going your own way, dude."
2417,poopiedoodie710,Closest I’ve found to any sort of positive space for men has been r/menslib. Admittedly I’m kinda leery about this sub but I’ll give it a chance; r/MGTOW has some warped individuals on there lol
2418,MuleFool42,"Exactly. Men need to share stories, collaborate, and support each other. That's what it should be, instead it's a cesspool over there. This is a much better sub."
2419,GTOH4U,"Yep, that's where it's going. Just an incel woman hating jerk circle rather that a positive group where people discussed what path they were taking and how to do it etc."
2420,,"this exactly. 

Westerners have been so brainwashed by the 6 million lie it is utterly ridiculous to have an educated discussion about this.

I have seen the information you are talking about and the 6 million figure was lauded by jewish press going back into the 1800s for a number of events."
2421,DyingSociety,I like to think that most individuals are sane in mgtow but this screams mental health issues. Maybe I shouldn't associate myself with these people considering what the mod did...
2422,weasted_,Mb rip bro
2423,simplisticallysimple,"No doubt, but we all already know that. Like I said, there's a time and place for everything. And I hope this place wouldn't become a place for that. Men seem to have trouble discussing women ""dispassionately"" because most have been burned bad and can't shake off that bitterness. In the end, it devolves into women-bashing all over again, like r/MGTOW."
2424,,[deleted]
2425,,[deleted]
2426,MuleFool42,"I think that, over time, r/MGTOW2 will be more popular as it is the essence of what MGTOW should be, and not a bunch of fringe haters."
2427,nla6219,You are the first feminist i have ever heard say anything even remotely reasonable or sane. Im shocked and impressed. I dont know what else to say lol. Two thumbs up 👍👍😅
2428,alamsohel1990,true way to go
2429,cursed_deity,i don't think so because the first time got banned was because i gave the tip to not hate women but to simply ignore them and focus on bettering yourself
2430,IntellegoTheTrue1,Yeah that sounds like a reasonable thing
2431,cursed_deity,"come on, lets not use incel as an insult. 

we should be better as that"
2432,T0000009,"you can tell it's subversion of some kind, look at what get's posted now and the quality of the comments."
2433,FlintAustin,"Yup. I am pretty sure there is a woman somewhere there.

Some faggot admin found his way in but left his balls behind."
2434,FlintAustin,"The whole point for mgtow is men doing their thing and speaking their mind.

Some men will always have some reservations toward liking or disliking women that swings on extreme ends. But they have a very narrow approach.

Kind of good to be banned. Was being too pessimistic."
2435,Loban8990,I already have. Ive been a member of that sub from my other account since 2014 and a year on this one. Ive always followed thier rules so it is annoying to just be kicked out with no explanation. But whatever I unsubbed from there with both accounts.
2436,,Cause you sound like a dumb liberal fag to the mods in your comment thats explanation enough
2437,unblackmailable,"Maybe it's more simple than that.  Let me kick in an open door.  I don't think they ban you because they hate themselves, I think they ban just because they can.  What I believe at this point is, that one must present themselves as more than virtuous or you get cannibalised by your own kind, e.g. not red enough for a communist, not green enough for an environmentalist ... it's all very political in a sense that politics have become the new religion.  The Spanish inquisition didn't only burn demons, they got innocent people to."
2438,vHohenheim23,"It is stupid. You should be allowed to say whatever you want, exactly because it is a public domain. It's called freedom of speech/expression etc. 

So I guess the main question should be. Is reddit a platform(does not censor as they won't be forced to take responsibility for content made on their platform) or a publisher(a bunch of illiterates that censor opposition)...? Which one is it? 

It's even more disconcerting when the interpretation of ""racism/nazism"", ""women-hating"" etc gets left to a  bunch of overly sensitive man-children. 

What offends them, might not offend you or me. What they deem ""hatred"" might not be hatred at all. They just don't like the message, so they delete it and ban the user to silence any opposing opinions. 

Are homosexuals equal to the rest of us, or are they a protected class to the point where you'll get banned just for calling someone gay? Because that is what the latter looks like, that's then not ""equality"" like they bark the whole day, it's enforcing a ""protected class"". That's something entirely different, but that is the type of nonsense you get left with when a bunch of fruitcakes get to decide the ""rules"" everyone should ""abide"" at instead of leaving everyone to discuss issues, regardless of how ""offensive"" it is; like any supposed-to-be civilized nation."
2439,unblackmailable,"you're right.  I was thinking about a sword of Damocles that hangs over one's head when saying something slighty off, when I wrote it.  It came across totally differently.  But calling it stupid might not be correct either.  If it's stupid but it prevents a negative result...it's just ignorance."
2440,kittynovalove,You’re proving my point
2441,FlintAustin,"Monk mode is toxic? Not sure what interaction with others plays a factor here.

What is toxic is this notion of self-improvement masquerading some serious underlying desire to feel validated from others.

A monk has achieved far greater self-improvement living amidst the constant chaos."
2442,Pliyii,Because there isn't. There question answered. No need to get philosophical about it.
2443,WolverineDLogan,The moderating team must be full of those damn incels.
2444,ausgamer529,"My way is the only way I'm going from now on. I tried my best with women for years and it was height and looking too young that made relationships impossible with them. Now that I have a man in my life who loves me it is like a huge weight lifted from me. 
Thanks for the support brother"
2445,Azuzu88,"For a while I noticed quite a few guys speaking up about how the self-improvement posts had died out and all of the posts were about hating women, but they eventually dried up."
2446,MetaCognitio,"I stay on the fringes to be honest. I listen to what some of the youtubers and posters have to say, but the deeper parts of the MGTOW community have some really screwed up people (and some that aren't obviously). Some of these guys literally HATE women.

The fact that I got banned, the post has 34 upvotes and the guy has a daughter really bothers me. At least some of the replies are better. Although one spoke about that being the reason why there are selective abortions in India so they can have male children 🤮"

Edit: is MGTOW against liberalism? TIL MGTOW is authoritarian then, I guess."
2457,AlanTheGr8,"Well yeah anyone who is smarter or better at anything is seen as a threat and not as a cohort/assett/friend and is instantly destroyed.

All the musicians jealous of my music or pua skills did everything the could to kneecap and ban me.

But what ur saying is a lil diff.

What ur saying is anything outside the norm must be eliminated. Like the japanese say the nail thar sticks uo must be hammered down."
2458,Ferg_NZ,You raise a good point.  If you are not extreme then you are treated as some sort of mutant.  There is nothing wrong with having empathy for other positions.
2459,Impossible-asset,"Context is important here. 

If you show up and start making posts about ""this is gay, that is gay, I might go eat some hay I can make things out of clay, and lay by the bay, I just may, whaddya say?""  Well, then your post would get removed and the mods would tell you at least what rule of the sub you were breaking. 

It you persist at it and constantly become a nuisance, then you should be shadow banned or temporarily banned. But you have to try pretty hard for that to happen here. 

As for freedom ot speech. Well, yes and no. We do want to encourage people to discuss things here, as long as it falls within the direction and purpose of the sub. And that is basically one that mgtow is a healthy life philosophy for men. 

Its not a place just bash on women or complain about access to or lack thereof of sex. It's for men who are walking a mgtow journey and want to talk with others who are doing the same, and offer advice or answer questions for men who would like to and have questions about it.  On topic discussion. 

If we just said ""hey it's a free speech bastion"" we'd end up with a meme-littered negativity fest and before long the sub would get shut down. 

So yes, the sub is moderated to keep the level of discussion elevated, for the benefit of all the subscribers. I hope that helps explain things a bit."
2460,Frelsi_8899,"I agree with everything you said, unfortunately, there's no fixing it. 

And it doesn't stop there. There's a mod on /r/infidelity that bans post just at the sheer mention of pronouns she deems unfit. Eg: Female. Until that sub I had no idea that some people consider the word female an insult. I just use it as a synonym for women. 

Same like I call women, birds, chicks, chicas, for the last few decades no one ever took offense. 

Problem is 1 foul moron, who's actually in charge of a pretty serious sub, which is the first sub people go to looking for information and support for infidelity, a VERY serious subject matter, are at the whim of some feminist with the emotional EQ of a 5-year-old and the mannerisms and maturity of a stubborn 19 year old. 

At no point do these people step back and just let the users of these subs get on with what they want. 

And does their policing really help? Well, no one likes to be policed. But if it hits the point where it's no fun anymore, or simply broken, that's when subs lose traction, and when that happens Reddit loses traction."
2461,IntellegoTheTrue1,If you monk till the point you can't talk and interact with people with some sort of self awareness there is no MGTOW group where you don't risk to be kicked out from. MGTOW is not about solipsism.
2462,DangZagnut,Seems unfair. How will we tell our banned stories from /r/mgtow2?
2463,LordMasterN,"From what I have seen, r/menslib has gone to the opposite extreme- it is all self-hating men and misandry now."

Hypocrisy. I can't stand it."

It's as if all they want from me is my sperm....

2480,reinaldo866,"""I put up this post as the daily reminder of why the MGTOW life is fundamentally necessary in our day and age""

&#x200B;

If you are trying to ""date"" actively I think you are not reminding yourself daily why MGTOW is necessary, it's like a Christian trying to remember Jesus everyday but sinning all the time.

&#x200B;

Or maybe am I the one confused about MGTOW? I thought it was about men leaving the plantation"
2481,phlegmdawg,Sounds like good communication/dating philosophy to me. It’s also how you filter out non-likeminded people. You dodged an incompatible bullet. Just like with any other dealbreaker.
2482,Impossible-asset,"Post approved, barely. 

But ""woman does X; means women are bad; posting as a reminder to stay mgtow""  is largely a wasted effort.

It's like going into a physics class with a bunch of grey-haried German physicists and bouncing a ball and saying ""reminding you all of that third law of motion! """
2483,Impossible-asset,"It's basically still a custom for men to pay on the first date. 

If you want to date, and play that game, then you are basically playing by their rules. Is it fair? No. 

So why bother with it? If you're looking to date and get into a relationship, theres not much helpful analysis or commentary you'll find here."

Stop dating or stop posting stories about the obvious."
2487,GlobalAsshat,"Wait until the date to bring it up after you've already ordered and you can really get her going. All serious conversation should be done face to face, not over the phone or texts, in my opinion. Whatever though. It's no big loss. She can't see your ""cocky smile"" that shows your dominance when you're over the phone.

I like lunch buffets.. I'll pay because they're cheap and if they're single mothers, often they can be up for quickies when the kids are at school. I don't have nor want a ""nightlife"" where I'm out in bars until midnight."
2488,WildChad,"Great work!  


It is always best policy to be up front with your boundaries.  


This way those who disagree overtly can do so and you save a lot of time.  


Those who disagree covertly, i.e. accept up front, but ""change their mind"" later,  
You can always go firmly back you having been already up front with her so you have yourself covered.  


Being up front about boundaries also help against being gas-lighted pretty well, or slowly manipulated."
2489,DangZagnut,Women only care about money.  Shocking I know.
2490,timmeh83,First dates should always be dutch. I've offered to pick up the cheque when it's just a coffee but they usually still try and still insist on paying. This is why coffee is a great first date.
2491,3ddie89,"Although you have every right to not pay its totally up to you. And would have agreed if it was another circumstance, but you did ask her out on date. Thus as a gentleman and if you are interested it would have been  nice thing to do. In todays society there is alot of femists but keep in mind not everyone is and I dont think should change the way you approach women. Maybe she did back out because she wanted a free meal or maybe she didnt. Women are wired different than us. Maybe she just took it a little offensive. Either way, you shoot your shot with your women if you cant do an inexpensive meal after you were the one that asked her out. Than maybe you should wait till a girl asks you out. I dont mean anything in a bad way. A single meal wont kill you if its a girl that really interests you."
2492,xDuelx,Why do you still date?
2493,avtarius,"Most of them just want the free meal anyway. They just don't admit it.

There's a reason some advise to go on a Coffee first date, so you can use it as a cheap filter."
2494,Platinum247365,"Damned if you do, and damned if you don't when it comes to dating. I was so much happier with my life when I decided I was not going to play that game anymore."
2495,pedanticpterodactyl,Bullet dodged indeed!
2496,ZarBandit,"In my mid-20's blue pill days, I took her to Taco Bell and *split the bill*.   For no other reason that I was too ignorant to realize it was assumed I should pay, especially for $4.  She told me (much later) she was speechless and couldn't believe I actually did that.  But Red Pillers know what comes next:  I fucked her.  My cluelessness played off like a high value male, and that got all the tingles going."
2497,batfish55,"I don't understand why guys post here about their flirting with, and trying to date, women.  That's kind of not the point of MGTOW.  They're all a sexual _________ lawsuit waiting to happen."

2499,fryhldrew,"Well, the ones who agree to Dutch a few times at the start, and then manipulate the simps and cucks to pay for ""their"" new house and taking care of Chad's kids - heavy bullets. But yes, a Dodge is a Dodge. A Dodge it is"
2500,WolverineDLogan,Lol so you pay for her to get the pussy eventually. Hmmm banging a slut would be easier then.
2501,bunnytron,"Have you gotten any dates since, and if so, were there 2nd dates after going Dutch?"
2502,daniellederek,I think they are both shortsighted. I'm a firm believer in my wallet being proportionately open to her legs. A little pre meal fellatio goes a long way to me saying yes to steak and lobster.....
2503,cz_masterrace,She is okay with a form of prostitution then
2504,hosteredraddish,Dude if you invite someone else to dinner you should pay for it. Regardless of sex or feminist ideals.
2505,Amphibole_,"Fair enough for her to do so. Everyone can hold their own standards.

I don't understand what you're getting at."
2506,,"Is this the right sub?

Isn't this about MGTOW?"
2507,Augustine2017,Agreed. What especially struck me was how uncompromising and cold-hearted she was about it. Keep in mind we’d invested several hours of our time connecting over the phone. To have her go from 60-0 without even trying to compromise and explain her position showed me where her priorities were.
2508,Dls95405,"Absolutely, fuck her. Women are desperately trying to find a cash cow now, it’s easy to spot and avoid them."

2510,Augustine2017,This one definitely fell into that last camp. Used a very similar line.
2511,Augustine2017,"I should clarify— I generally don’t date. Every now and again, I meet someone who I think might be different, so I tip my toe in the water. And I’m quickly reminded why I don’t date. So I’m reminding myself as much as I am trying to remind others.

That said, MGTOW isn’t a religion with definite commandments and sins. It’s only a principle that men are free to interpret in their own ways."
2512,jp_mra,"Nothing wrong with a MGTOW dating if it's on his terms and the woman is quality. My personal rule is that I never ask a girl out or chase a woman. If she asks me out and puts in the effort, and is my type, I'll consider."
2513,Augustine2017,"Highly appreciated. I can’t speak for others, but I’d consider myself fairly MGTOW and I appreciate the reminder so that I don’t fall back to old ways. Still, point taken 👍🏻"
2514,BilboBagginhole,WTF? why are you being downvoted for stating obvious knowledge? Is this a dating advice sub now?
2515,xDuelx,For some reason I still find it shocking how modern women act
2516,Augustine2017,"Good comment, but you should know that I suggested drinks only. Then she insisted it be drinks, mini golf, and dinner. All for the first date. She also demanded to go to certain restaurants and mini golf places. Now you might see why I made it clear up front."

2524,,"You seem like a smart, reasonable dude.  So many of these men on here think that MGTOW is a club or something and want to put out a news letter and have rules.

Reminds me of the stump fuckers who join motorcycle gangs; they are so individualistic and free that they have to be told what they are allowed to wear and ride and are worth less as an individual then the whole.

You do what you have to do.  If casually dating while you keep your shit together makes you happy (as it does me), then more power to you."
2525,3ddie89,"Ahhh I see. See you didnt post that. If that was the case then I agree with you now. If she got choosey and suggested all that then yea, she is tripping and being pushy all in the first date."

2527,bunnytron,With other people since too?
2528,Impossible-asset,"It's the context. If it's your buddy and you ask ""happy hour at Maloney's?"" Then you go. You dont buy the whole time, but usually ""first round's on me"" is polite enough. And then your buddy will probably buy you a round. 

Coworkers? ""Hey, wanna try that new hipster Dutch baby spot today?"" Well, that's fine because you're both already in the same situation (work), so Dutch yould be expected. 

Wanting a romantic encounter. Well, women are attracted to resources first. That's just how it is. If you're looking for a relationship and you dont play that game, well, you can expect to strike out. 

It's not a game worth playing."
2529,hosteredraddish,"true. I would expect to pay for myself. However when it is explicitely made clear that its a date like ""let me take you out"", generally that what is expected. I personally don't pay for her because I dont really phraze it like that.
Women equate money to interest, weather or not you are a cheapskate and it generally just bruises there ego. Isnt always a problem but it doesn't help your cause.
The other night I was at a club and I asked these girls if they wanted to dance on the main dance floor and she said she would if I bought her friend a drink. 
I stuck my hand in her face and said i don't pay for women's company, and walked off. lol"
2530,Amphibole_,"I agree what you say about feminists.

The thing is she never claimed to be a feminist or anything of the like. She's just some woman with traditional values..."
2531,Impossible-asset,"Yes he is. 

What isnt in the right place is a post that points out obvious knowledge going back to, well, forever. 

""Women care about money and what you spend on them""  .....  ""this one wouldnt date me if I didnt pay""   .... well. Yeah.  r/asktrp or maybe r/r/purplepilldebate is a better spot for people who want to discuss sating situations from a redpill perspective. Just my opinion."
2532,Amphibole_,"But it's normal for women to want to be paid for. Their attraction is heavily based on being taken care of.

I would see the joke, but there isn't one, because the OP appears to be seriously looking for a relationship. This is a game he is choosing to play, he can't complain about it to people who have chosen not to."
2533,Augustine2017,"No problem you mean?

Same. I’ve noticed that girls who are actually into me have no problem splitting. They prioritize people over money.  Perish the thought."
2534,Augustine2017,"No, I’m not dating. Going monk for now"
2535,hundakuten,Are you sure you're not looking for a PUA forum?
2536,Blexit2020,">She's just some woman with traditional values...

Exactly. I keep trying to tell some of y'all that you're gonna mess around and shoot yourselves in the foot because you're pushing away good women with Conservative, traditional values; likely women who have some kind of religious upbringing. Generally, not all, but *generally,* these types of women are anti-feminist and embrace their roles as women which is to be a help -meet to their husbands. I honestly don't know what else to say anymore, because it's not dissimilar from what feminists do to men and then complain about there ""not being any good men left."" Well, it's because all of the ""good men"" you want have traditional values, and your emasculating BS is a complete turn off to them. So, they walk away from or avoid you completely. 

It's the same with MGTOW/red pill men who are still dating for whatever reason. If you try to pull that ""true equality"" mess on a woman with traditional values, she's going to be turned off. That means, you just pushed away a woman that likely believes in submitting to her husband, the man being the head of the household, home cooked meals, washing your drawls, and keeping the marriage bed undefiled and satisfactory, and you being [the king of the castle](https://youtu.be/_e1Hw39C7lE). These women are also usually raised that approaching men is forward and unladylike, so the *only* way you can encounter her is if you do the courting. A woman that is ok with ""going dutch,"" NSA sex, hanging out in bars drinking and carrying on, is likely a feminist! The very type of person a lot of MGTOW men say they're actively trying to avoid. It's like they want a woman with traditional values, but feminist behaviors. It don't work that way, pimpin' lol. You either get a lady with traditional values whom you have to present with equally traditional values or you get a feminist. Those are your options if you choose to date instead of going monk. 

There are a lot of good men and women out there who want to love and connect with someone and start a family. And feminists and MGTOW cats are gonna mess around and push good candidates away because they're trying so hard to ""beat the system"" and prove a point. Once you've gotten to a point where you're actively blocking your own blessings, it is *then* that you've become a slave to the system. I've seen this happen in person. This girl got mad because this guy who was interested in her opened the door for her. This guy's a complete gentleman and a darn good catch. He has very traditional values and will make an excellent husband and father some day. And this heifer had the nerve to get mad because he opened doors for her? She sure didn't get mad when he was paying for her meals and driving up his gas getting her to work every day, though. If I sound irritated, I am, because this is my little brother I'm talking about, and I didn't appreciate the way this girl did him at **all.**

Traditional values don't mix with feminism and MGTOW. So if you want to date and adhere to MGTOW, you're going to be relegated to the feminists you hate, because a woman with traditional values will be put off by you. Period."
2537,Ridewithme38,"Its not so much a game he's playing as he has a type. Just like you may not want to date a fat girl, he does not want to date a girl who doesnt contribute equally."
2538,KhajiitFL,"FYI: PUA != MGTOW

You're striking me as a PUA type that flies a MGTOW flag"
2539,Thotsithinknots,Np yea. You are correct. I've had 10s pay insist on paying their way. You stuck to your guns. Respect. I'm the same way. Draw that hard line.
2540,Amphibole_,"Just because he isn't completely ignorant to the dating scene doesn't mean he's involving himself in it. 

Did you know that some people go MGTOW as a response from learning red pill theory, opposed to just blindly going along without understanding the social dynamics relating to it?"
2541,Amphibole_,"You make a good point, but I think it's too easy to say traditional = good, equality = bad. 

I mean the above is 'probably' true if you want a long term relationship like your brother, but the reverse is true for men who don't want one, and are just interested in the short term right?

And the OP rejected someone for holding traditional values, indicating he just wanted someone for the short term. 

I would argue that short term isn't worth it, especially given the type of people who want equality, as you said. But the same goes for long term. Just because they're traditional, doesn't mean it's a good deal, nor does it mean they're any different from most other women at heart (AWALT). It's up to each individual (who dates) to decide which they want, and if they go for the reverse, what more can they expect than to get hurt.

&#x200B;

I suppose there are also women who take this traditional perspective of wanting to be paid for, and then acting in every way non-conservative. I think that's the reason for the OP to make this thread. He's trying to warn us of women who kinda chameleon traditionalism to exploit mens' wallets?

 

But again, the OP indicated to the woman he wants something short term (equal pay), and she rejected on terms that either (1) she doesn't want short term, or (2) she's chameleoning traditionalism for a free meal.

So, is he warning us of (1) or (2)... well he never found out which one she was, so it's all too likely she's simply traditional. Leaving me to ask, why did he make this thread and why is everyone pretending there is a lesson to be learnt from his story?"
2542,,"Men paying for dates ended when women largely entered the workforce in ww1 and ww2. Now, there is no reason for not go half on dates."
2543,Amphibole_,"When I said he's playing a game, I was referring to him trying to go on dates with women. All that 'nonsense', it is all just part of what women are, and these things repel MGTOW individuals. 

&#x200B;

But if the OP wants to date that's fine and it's on him. He can want a relationship with someone who pays for themself. But it goes both ways. She can also want someone who pays for her. 

The difference is he wants equality, and she doesn't. But if you want a sustainable relationship, equality is irrelevant, as attraction is asymmetrical. Again, it's up to him but just don't complain about what you're choosing to engage in."
2544,Amphibole_,"What did I say that makes you think so, and why? I'm a MGTOW who never dates or anything of the like, nor do I intend to ever in the future.

I'm arguing that the dating scene is asymmetrical for biological reasons, and if people choose to date, this is something that they must accept. Personally, this would be a downside to dating but as a MGTOW, I don't date so idgaf and idk who in this sub would care."
2545,Thotsithinknots,I would even tell her she should be ashamed of herself its 2019!
2546,bunnytron,"Usually when the girl insists on paying for herself, it means she is not interested and has friend-zoned. But I also know of many exceptions where if the man is unemployed/underemployed or they’re college-aged that going Dutch is common practice"
2547,hundakuten,"Man, you make me cringe so hard"
2548,Blexit2020,"I was being very general when I said good men/women have traditional values. Obviously, people are individuals and should be judged by their character. I wasn't so much stating that people with traditional values are usually ""good people to be in relationships with"" as I was stating that people who are good candidates for relationships usually have traditional values. Does that make sense?

All in all, I, too, am unsure what the exact message OP is trying to convey, here. To draw parallels with feminists again, it's like complaining that there are men out there who have the ""nerve and audacity"" to expect a woman to be more submissive, feminine, and allow him to lead. It just sounds like a typical situation of encountering someone who doesn't share your values and with whom you're incompatible. That's...*normal.* There's nothing wrong with having traditional values, and if one doesn't want to adhere to traditional values, they have every right to look elsewhere. But there's no reason to ring the proverbial alarm and ""warn"" others that people with traditional values exist. Even if the intent was to imply the ""chameleon theory"" it's still unnecessary. That's like saying, ""Beware of ""smiling faces."" Sometimes people are nice to others just to get what they want out of them."" Naw, really, lol?

>Just because they're traditional, doesn't mean it's a good deal, nor does it mean they're any different from most other women at heart (AWALT). 

That's very true. But it is a good temperature gauge, for sure.

Maybe it's because I'm a socially awkward weirdo, but I'll never understand why so many people who claim to be tired of being generalized by certain groups then proceed to generalize others themselves. Literally every demographic does this ad nauseam; *especially* these past few years. I swear, depending on the subject matter, every online discussion involves some variation of the following:

White people always...

Black people always...

Conservatives always...

Liberals always...

Immigrants always...

[Insert religious group here] always...

Men always...

Women always...

Do you ever think that we'll get to a point in society where we start judging people based upon *who* they are instead of *what* they are? The fact that humans are even managing to coexist anymore with this type of thinking being so widespread is nothing short of a miracle. I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop, because it's like everyone is just sick of everyone now, lol."
2549,Impossible-asset,Pretty much this.
2550,KhajiitFL,">Their attraction is heavily based on being taken care of.

Hallmarks of pick-up artistry."
2551,BilboBagginhole,Go back to r/MGTOW with that shit.  Nothing said here should make you cringe.
2552,Amphibole_,"Uh-huh, that's right. 

Both your posts are aggressive with no argumentative value. 

I'd ask why you're even here but looking at the quality of your speech, I'm scared that you'll call me a poo poo head or something..."
2553,Amphibole_,"Honestly, I haven't really noticed much generalising of groups directly. I mean there is a strong media agenda against straight white males in games and movies and all that, but it's a bit specific..

I'm trying to think of what it's most similar to and I just come up with the general dislike of people who are in a different category to yourself, or really just people who have different opinions.

But at the same time, the internet makes it so much easier to avoid it and only speaking to people who hold the same opinions. Take MGTOW for example, even with a heavy social rejection of MGTOW, it's easy to find this sub.

This leads me to the next point, that even within the groups there may be differences in opinion. But a ridiculous proportion of society are ignorant in many ways. They don't look to correct fallacies in their arguments, or find problems with their behaviour to improve. 

What I'm getting to is that most people who dislike people for having different opinions, are also almost always going to confide in their own group, where they will choose to avoid discussions of any disagreements. This provides them with a safe place, so they won't have a strong need to leave their group to attack others (too frequently). For this I don't think there will be any major repercussions on a societal level. 

Having said this, it feels like the topic is too vague for my answer to hold any meaning. but at the same time, I'm thinking that there can't just be a reason for society to crumble, but there must also be a sufficient driving force. Enough people have to respond in a particular way, and I don't see this happening."
2554,Amphibole_,"I don't care if it's a hallmark of anything. I'm saying what I think is true.

Maybe try counter my argument opposed to attempting to discredit myself."
2555,hundakuten,"Hahah, speaking about aggressive or post quality..."
