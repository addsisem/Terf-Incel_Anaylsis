9,ThePanther1989,"Just add a weight room, a walk in humidor, a cellar, and I am set. Keep in mind, if I let a woman move in...those three things would be gone; at the very least, she would demand that I get rid of my weights and the walk in humidor, and try to have her gaggle of girlfriends over constantly to raid the cellar and drink me dry! Trust me, if you move a woman in..she will try it..your peaceful home will be a distant memory! Your life and your peace of mind above any woman! Go your own way!"

25,Sarm11111,"Once i kept my main room/living room nicely decorated by a buddy wife.  I had kept it up and put all my man things in the basement, like a big screen, my desk, pc ,,you get it.  And I‚Äôll admit it  was to have an area that I could entertain women.  Over time and a few shitty relationships I  started asking myself the tough questions and first was do I really want a women moving in or marriage for that.  I have always had a very low trust factor for women. And without going into it the lack of trust stemmed from some very criminal things by women, that no one would believe.  I wasn‚Äôt an INCEL, far from it, but after the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù I retreated and stopped dating.  And witnessed other warning signs with friends and coworkers .  So I asked those questions, do I really want to have a wife/women in my life to the extent of bring them home or marrying, and the answer was no, hell no.  So I bought a huge screen, cut a hole in the dinning room table to mount a tv in to play games with friends, decorated my walls with dragon heads, swords , and so on.  So now my man cave is my whole house and I vouknr care less what any women would say, because I‚Äôll probably be pushing them out the door to a cab.and I love my childish dungeon."

The compliment should be delivered in a certain tone of voice, given at the appropriate time. etc etc etc.  It's far, far more trouble than it's worth.

&#x200B;

Show of hands kids, who has the answer? 

&#x200B;

Feminism exist today only as a function of censorship, and that is exactly why they try to paint you guys with that brush, to silence you and redirect from your argument.

&#x200B;

Look, I'm an MRA, but not MGTOW. I'm married, long term (I found a great one from a previous generation- well I may be MGTOW because I did go my own way), but the message is as clear as if it were a written like a flash burnt across the sky, and the only way it can be defended is by calling you ""misogynist"" or some other vile name so as to dismiss you and silence the conversation, keep people from looking up.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately there are too many women out there starting to agree, and as Dr. Smith stated, ""if men are not allowed to speak, I will speak for them"". I had a phone conversation recently with one of the most notable women in the MRM, and even she replied to my comment that ""I don't subscribe to women bashing"" with, ""well, society and women have a lot to account for"".

98,30203forever,"And by ""family courts"" you mean the ""Divorce tribunals""? Because they're neither ""family"" nor ""courts"", IMHO...."
99,30203forever,"I agree with what you wrote. Personally, I define feminism as the political movement of the sub-par females to leverage their vote in order to get their hands on the resources which they ""deserve"" but are not able or unwilling to get the traditional way (i.e. scamming the males out of their money under the current gynocentric laws). And they're using their phony ""victimhood"" because it helps greatly with that. The ""equality"" which the feminists are constantly harping about is actually the ""equality of outcome"" along the lines of: ""that woman was able to secure a good husband &/or job and  I was not; therefore, it's obvious that the patriarchy is oppressing me and I deserve to be compensated by society for being persecuted."" That's how the feminists really think and that's the very reason why you never argue with them: it's next to impossible to make someone understand something when their income depends on NOT understanding it. IMHO, the equality of outcome (i.e. communism) is not equality at all and I'm talking from personal experience, actually. As Aristotle said 2.5K years ago, ""The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal."" The feminism is evil in its most basic form and must be fought with everything we'we got because if it wins, the men will become the abject slaves, no doubt about it...."

102,DJ-Roukan,"That was pretty brilliant, guy."
103,WildChad,"I have come to the exact same end conclusion that feminism, the way it trends, leads to re-introduction of slavery as it ultimately desires to have the power to arbitrarily call any sexual act a criminal offense whenever it wants - Only dictators are in the same position as the power they have is to command the hand of the law according to their will - In its completion this would reduce men to a slave class while women would be elevated to noble citizenry / master class, just like Ancient Greece and Rome had a slave class of sub-humans who were there to do all the work that could be exploited in any way on the whim of the master class citizens.  


This is the end game agenda, even if not conscious one, of feminism.  
In other words, even if well intended, this is the automatic final state if feminism does not meet enough resistance."
104,DJ-Roukan,"You are not alone my friend. Most people have not heard a great many truths about feminism...because they have become so adept at the lie, have so much power, they can not only censor the movie, but the very fact that they did censor it.  They censor the truth, then they hide the truth, then they hide the fact that they hid the truth.

&#x200B;

Most people that I speak with on line, that still believe that feminism is about equality and not a hate group aimed at men, are so naive of the truth, have so little understanding, that it would take ten posts to bring them up to speed.

106,30203forever,"Yep. The end goal is to enslave the hated bottom 80% ""below average undesirable"" men while using the top 20% as their playthings.

110,DJ-Roukan,You bet. Glad to help.
111,30203forever,">Maybe the femanuts try doing one of their ""studies"" on male Humor.

Not going to work because stupid people do not usually understand humor and hate the people who do (usually, the men). That's because the feminists are not only devoid of the sense of humor themselves, jealous of others who have it but are also very suspicious & fearful that people are joking at their expense (which is not entirely untrue...). As far as ""get a life"" goes, that's the core of the issue: they are feminists precisely because they can't get a life and NOT the other way around...."
112,30203forever,"I saw that post an agree with that. In addition, the females want the right to reinterpret consent post-factum and sometimes years or decades after the fact. Case in point: the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. Not only that, they want their claims to be judged to be ""true till proven false"" and not the other way around (i.e. #BelieveAllWomen). In short they want the end of the Due Process but only in one direction because ""reasons"". I have a simple solution to all that mindfuckery, at least on the personal level. Do not engage with any ""regular"" women in the West. Avoid them like the plague they are. To me, they are all the property of the state, their real daddy-husband and I do not mess with the government property.... P.S. You're ""better"" than me because I reported, blocked that person & forgot about it..."
113,DJ-Roukan,"and you are getting smarter every time I read you...

kidding of course, but dead on the money accurate."
114,WildChad,"Oh yeah, I didn't even remember post-factum which is horrible.

In the worst case not only you'd need to record all your sex acts with women, you'd have to store them forever - And when it comes to the current practices of divorce courts, evidence for the man is often completely ignored by the judge - So practically you'd never be safe even with consent.

I think you are completely right about ending Due Process, which is currently in the process of being eroded for women just because vagina.

And yes, avoid all BP women in the West and gauge actively for these belief systems in any women you engage with in order to stay safe."

123,Trek13,"got banned from r/mgtow twice.  Both times for criticizing  ""dear Leader"" (fucking Trump) in response to idiotic posts praising him.  Politics should be on the sidebar as not allowed and I mostly could ignore the Freeper types on that sub but over time the stupidity just got under my skin.   Also, too many ""victims"" there.  Pretty sure I pissed some people off pointing that out.  Sure, things are somewhat stacked against men in our society, especially white men right now, but if you stand back and objectively look at things it is mostly background noise.   I will take being a white male in this society any day, we are NOT oppressed and if you have half a brain it is not hard to compete and succeed.   Thank god I am not saddled from birth with the crutch of ""victimhood"" like women and other groups are.

And I can say as far as ""MGTOW"" as a concept, probably 90+% of of guys on r/mgtow are just not there.   It seems more of an AA for men in pain dealing with redpill truths.    I wish them goodluck in their pursuit of ""mgtow"", its not for everyone thats for sure.   But FFS keep the reich wing political BS out of it. 

 I say this as a 60 year old, never married, no kids, original ""confirmed bachelor"", retired early, financially independent ""loner"".    Lots of women in my past but could never let go of my freedom."

130,,"I left voluntarily. Too many self-defeatist foreveraloners that are not interested in self development. Not interested in sharing life strategies. Too eager to fall for the clickbait media. I've also been guilty of this in the past. It's very easy to get into the bitter loop concerning feminists. But brandishing all women as having the same agenda is just as stupid as a libtard saying all men are toxic. It serves no purpose. It brings nothing to the quality of your life. MGTOW subreddit in its current state is an echo chamber.

I've seen a conversion from when the incel subreddit got banned. Most of the MGTOWs who shared their wisdom are no longer on the subreddit. A MGTOW I met in London even calls them menimists and refuses to go back on there. A few good posters remain. But they are drowned out by the overwhelming outrage porn.

It's a sinking ship. And that's because visiting the subreddit leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. A hyper focus on the worst of female nature. The worst of society.

Men need male spaces though. Men need brotherhood. Is this subreddit got the markings to provide that? I'm not entirely sure at the moment. However, for me it's time to turn a new leaf. Get back to the original intention of MGTOW. It wasn't to shun yourself away from society. It was to avoid commitment aka marriage and anything that does not serve men on his path. It was to place your hobbies and interests at the forefront. To realise that you're more than just your biological imperative. And I kind of deviate here from most MGTOWs, I don't think hooking up with women is bad if you are smart about it. Essentially the first inception of MGTOWs were the single bachelor types. I think through MGTOW subreddit getting popular. With YouTubers echoing clickbait  like TFM reading out the horror stories of gynocentrism it's become a bastardised version of itself.

Anyways, just my thoughts."

So much inexperience with those guys on there, as a 34 year old who has been through a lot with women, they became pretty transparent.  Got easy to tell who hadn't been with a girl and who had. "
132,HesperianDragon,Banned in the middle of the night while I slept. Can't think of what made them do this.
133,saaralgris,"Just got banned yesterday, not sure what I said that was so triggering. Never thought I'd say it but that sub is teeming with negativity, it's off my radar moving forward. "
134,Cyanidova,"The comment:

> Society just needs to stop pretending single moms are heroines or some sort of bullshit superwomen.

> Women are extremely superficial herd animals.  Bring shame back and they'll be back in line.

My reply

> What about men who have cheated and left women, or widowers

Only comment there. Got banned within minutes"
135,whyamiotaku565,Oh you mean mgtow who are open-minded and not anrgy red pilled divorc√©es 
136,mcsimeon,I got downvoted to hell just for questioning why they would actively avoid women 24/7. Seems a bit like the old Braincells subreddit. 
137,Liquid_Leopard,"Well, I always wondered what you had to get banned from /MGTOW and I found out! Apparently, well thought out answers and trying to have an adult conversation with mildly differing opinions is all it takes. "
138,yermanbob,"Just unsubbed at the same time as getting banned, apparently you can't ask why an idiot 20 year old got banned, I started to talk about the purity spiral and the creation of there own bubble vs free speech that I've seen kill many communities since athieism+

I predicted that sub will be going down within 18 months because they have lost focus on the welfare of men instead preferring to have a bitch fest at women. "
139,xpillx,"I just got banned from mgtow lol. They turned into a fucking hatred incel group. The amount of man jumping on high horse and virtue signaling there is astounding. I dont know a reason why I got banned. I had many good convos there but I guess ban was for 1 comment in thread where guy was virtue signaling to others about not wanting to fuck that chick he posted that actually looked amazing to me. I suggested that he hates looks too much and maybe he likes a dick in a butt. These guys turn into sjw feminazi that try to control freedom of speech. I dunno maybe they will make safety rooms for those incels soon too. There is a difference in not liking some women behavior and just her looks...
"
140,ArtDeve,I am relieved I finally got banned. /r/MGTOW is full of toxic and hypocritical incels.
141,NYLON_G,"I challenged a so called MGTOW on his slut shaming of an Asian female. I asked the question why he was so concerned about something he had no choice over and no control over.

His response was to launch into a personal tirade about doing whatever he wanted to do. He then attacked me personally and to top it off resorted to racial attacks. This from a MGTOW who has never met me and doesn't know anything about me.

I am convinced that r/MGTOW has been feminised and corrupted by feminists and anti-MGTOW shills. To be banned from the subreddit for having a discussion about MGTOW while the racist idiot sits in there doesn't surprise me. The fact that a text if admin would take sides with a racist does surprise me.

Race has nothing to do with MGTOW. However on racist Reddit subredfits this is not only permissible. It is supported and it is promoted. I will not be going back into that subreddit even as a lurker. It has become a hive of scum and villainy."
142,TimJohnsonIII,Got banned. No explanation. No reply when I questioned.
143,,"Yes. I did. I've also been banned from r/IncelTears and r/TrueFemcels. I was going to give r/feminism a shot, but I absolutely refuse to visit that sub under any circumstances. 

You either hate the targeted gender of those subs or get out. Reason and neutrality are not welcome. 

Honestly, I'm convinced incels have taken over r/MGTOW. They're just so hateful and miserable over there. It's depressing. Do you know not one of those men have posted anything to honor Father's Day? They're so busy hating women they forgot to show all the dads out there love today.

HAPPY FATHER'S DAY TO ALL OF THE GOOD FATHERS OUT THERE!

I didn't have mine, so I admire those who love and care for their children."
144,Oldschool085,"I got banned for jokingly saying ""who hurt you"". "
145,Milk_moustache,"Haha brilliant. I was banned for saying they over implied a negative relationship from a single photo. A man sat on a train with a bit of a somber look, that‚Äôs just the London look mate. 

These boys are salty "
146,delukard,"That sub is infested with looser that got cucked and now are crying.

99% of them are beta."
147,Bastard-of-the-North,Got banned for telling someone who questioned why the whole sub was hating on captain marvel that the sub is basically incels 2.0 and referring him here 
148,Membrudo,I think the mod's girlfriend hijacked his account.
149,DJDickJob,"If you haven't already been banned, just leave anyway. Fuck that sub. It belongs to the incels now. "
150,TheMasp,got banned  from posting because i asked why we have to be so angry/hating of women lol. I mean i know we are different and MGTOW/Redpill is about that. But we should i feel be working more for Mens benifit and our growth then venting and angry with women.
151,,What‚Äôs happening with the ppl being banned so much? Who‚Äôs running the MGTOW? It seems the ppl who are being banned are more MGTOW than not. I was just banned yesterday for no good reason
152,13Heathens,"Apparently, this warranted a ban:
  
""True love exists, but it's super rare in our generation.

I know these older couple, pretty well off and retired at about 50? The dude fell sick and was hospitalized, they had the option to discontinue treatment as it seemed hopeless (and was expensive as hell). I would've pulled the plug tbh but the lady did everything she could to treat him; risking their retirement plans.

Thankfully, he didn't have to go through the full course of expensive treatments and they're now enjoy their golden years.

I found out that they were each other's firsts and both worked hard together to earn their wealth. Guy's not a chad too.""
  
Some guy responded with ""Go. Away.""
  
""Not sure why you're so hostile. If you disagree with me, we can have a proper discussion.

Think of it this way.

Getting a unicorn is like winning a lottery. It's so rare that you might as well treat it as non-existent.

But are there lottery winners? Yes.

Should I spend a lot of resources in trying to win the lottery? No.

But the fact remains that there are lottery winners.""
  
Same guy responded with ""Wrong.""
  
I reported the last one for low effort and got the banned message shortly."

154,steelyknife1122,"Aaaaaand banned. Never offended any member. Bashed women like I was supposed to do. Wonder what kind of interesting posts from other banned or shadow banned users I could never read.

The mods are probably 40yo, red-haired women who have hit the wall and chain smoke cigarettes inside their apartments while watching reruns of desperate housewives."
155,,This guy was saying OP‚Äôs dead brother (who had committed suicide) was a failure so I called him out and got banned when he told me to fuck off and I replied that he should fuck his anime pillow. Is MGTOW full of furries and anime queers?
156,sikki_nixx,Lol I said MGTOW2 is a fantastic subreddit and got banned from MGTOW...lol
157,lordlahmacun,"I wasn't banned. I left myself. r/MGTOW sadly turned away from a supportive group for men who don't want commitments into a nightmare fuel of incels and alike. I am so disgusted with myself for actually falling for their misogynistic trap for months... 

Well, i guess that's just another dialectic. My life prior to MGTOW was antithesis and MGTOW was thesis. Now it's time for synthesis."
158,TigPlaze,A friend from MGTOW PMed me about having just gotten banned.  They gave him no reason why.  I made a post asking how someone can contest a ban in the event of a mistake.  My post vanished immediately.  This makes me think they have no interest in running MGTOW with integrity.  I invited him here to MGTOW2.
159,Implausible-asset,"Yes I got banned from r/mgtow for ""concern trolling"" on my old account. Nearly all the karma I had was from upvotes in that sub, but they banned me anyways. 

Yeah sorry no sorry, but when someone is complaining about not getting laid and is saying they're going to buy a gun and let fate decide, then yeah I'd say concern is warranted. 

I'm hopeful that here I can see the good posts on how mgtow helps men be better at being themselves, keeps them out of the trap of the marriage contract, and provides cautionary tales based on our own learning experiences with women. 

And mods for inevitable showing of the incels here, please hand out the bans like candy. Those fools are subreddit cancer."
160,Tsukikoselenia,"Been banned because.. I have absolutely no idea, honestly. Not even incel-bashing, defending women, or anything like that (it really isn't my type), just a sudden ban out of nowhere, maybe because of a talk with a guy about how improvement is important but saying that hard work will always work is false, since this guy's posts got deleted? Who knows. 

For a sub that wants to reach the 100k ans is so proud of it, randomly banning people doesn't exactly sound like a smart idea."
161,,[deleted]
162,Yasai101,"Well, I suppose Ill bring myself over to this sub after getting banned for some random comment.  After reading some 2d waifu BS and other simping shit I dared to point it out and got banned. Hope to see some good content here. Cheers."
163,kiryat,"I got banned and I vaguely remember a comment I said that might have gotten me banned.

The post was saying something along the lines of: ""Society should not support single moms choices, instead society should penalize and ostracize them"".

My comment was saying something along the lines of: ""I agree that society should not support single moms choices, but I'm not sure if penalizing and ostracizing them is helpful"".

Bam, banned!

Nuance is lost on the admin of r/MGTOW"
164,nuka-cola-girl,Got banned for saying 'Great post! Have you tried r/MGTOW2 ?' on a rare post that was actually about a man going his own way.

Fuck man. I dunno how to feel now. "
168,mentalidade_logica,"I got banned too, why? No idea!

Unsubscribed."
169,,I was banned after clearly pointing out that most of the guys on /r/mgtow sound like my catty hairdresser (the women-hating kind)
170,DJCheeky,"Shadowbanned for pointing out that a poster had fabricated an AITA thread to make a wife look like they hated their husband having friends, when in reality the husband's friend was being an asshole. Here we go self-reinforcing beliefs!"
171,theanchorman05,"Got banned about a hour ago.  I responded to a post where the guy was talking about women starting drama at work.  I proceed to tell him to move on and women talk smack about each other a lot and this dude proceeds to ask me if I'm slow.  I respond that obviously he hasn't moved on if he made a 8 paragraph story about the entire thing.  

&#x200B;

That was why I was banned. Not even a feminist sub would've banned me for that. I'm guessing the guy I responded to was a mod, oh well."
172,bluepepino,I got banned from r/feminism and r/mgtow .. go figure. lol
173,goodboy12,I got banned because I made fun of a shit meme. All I said was a 13 year old would think this is corny üòÇ

175,dJ_86,Banned for saying I was bi sexual
176,mgtowthrowaway255,"Got banned and was not even given a reason.

&#x200B;

Shows you everything you need to know about them. Those aren't true MGTOW and if they are that cowardly on the internet, you have to wonder how bad they are in real life. That's also why that subreddit attracts the lowest quality posters, who mostly seem to want to brag that they have money and women chase them now, which is ridiculous. If you want to attract women that's the opposite of MGTOW."
177,A_G_H_D,"Just got banned for trying to talk about what users think the MGTOW subreddit should be for. I guess that comes under the heading of ""concern trolling""? IDK. IDC. What I do know is , r/MGTOW is definitely not the place to talk about it."
178,ksimbobbery,Banned for calling them out on being worse than incels lol. Like banning me is going to do literally anything.
179,Sly21C,"I was banned, no reason given whatsoever. What's going on? I've been a brilliant participant AFAIK. Oh wait, except for one comment where I said I'm not a fan of TRP at all, that I thought MGTOW was better. "
180,russpav,"This is the comment that got me banned 2 months ago. When they banned me I realized they did me a favor. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad others are seeing this trend and speaking up as well. I first subscribed to MGTOW because there were good articles about self improvement and building better habits. The trend seems more and more externally focused and less and less about self improvement.

Repressing others (individuals or groups) does not free my mind, it traps it in a negative feedback loop of anger, fear and resentment. All of which I want to let go of and put down.‚Äù"

Yup, and guess what -- you guys are here, too.  Not a surprise."

187,purge1,"Just happened to me, honestly I just thought to look up MGTOW on reddit and found out the MGTOW sub is filled with women hating incels. The thread was the guy talking on Facebook with a girl about that the dogs are better than women, because dog won't divorce you and dog won't take your kids, and asked her what is the womens argument and she said vagina, he was like ""mhm, ok, what else?"". And one of responses there was ""vaginas stink anywhere, I don't need your disgusting hole"" or something, so I responded ""is this sub just riddled with incels?"" And they proved me right, by banning me. Is that really what MGTOW is about?"
188,,Got banned and 12 hours without a reply as to why I was banned. My post was about my concern about MGTOW community that I've heard from the YouTuber Angry MGTOW. Apparently angry incels got ahold of being mods there.

I reckon they banned me based solely on my other subreddits. I even asked for clarification and got no reply!  hahaha

The moderators are not replying to my reply to their 'ban message' (although they said ""reply to this message to get an explanation for your ban"") ... so, it appears the mods on r/MGTOW are not doing their job in a timely fashion, or they are corrupt. I'll miss that sub, but there is r/MGTOW2 and other forums on the internet to mingle with like-minded cats such as yourselves from time to time.

203,Pimozv,"I was banned.  I don't see why.  I asked the mods twice and received no answer.

Believe it or not, I remember when this sub use to be a place of discussion, a place where men turned to - to better themselves on their new found path, a place where men have chosen to go their own way to rectify what‚Äôs been torn apart do to the aftermath‚Äôs of failed marriages and relationships. Now almost all of that helpful knowledge and sound advice is being clouded by articles and rants that reflect misogyny, and at times, pure black pilled hatred. 

I understand that a lot of us come to this sub with red pill rage and need that outlet, but that rage will be the very death of this sub. Downvote this into oblivion for all I care, but I know there are men here who feel the same, if they haven‚Äôt already moved on.

237,timemeld,"Got banned today for asking this question on one of their posts. [post I commented on](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/bloxtl/an_excerpt_from_the_rationale_male_book/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) 

My comment:

[Just out of curiosity, can‚Äôt this be applied to males as well? A lot of my mates are pretty promiscuous dudes and have had plenty of one night stands. So with this logic, are they no different from the women this excerpt aims to shame? 

Not trying to ruffle feathers, just kinda curious on the stance about men that do the things MGTOW hate about women (cheating, sleeping around, using another person for any kind of temporary/ personal gain, etc.). I try not to keep dudes like that in my friend circle anymore,  I can certainly say I‚Äôve seen a lot of men do these things that women are so demonized for.  I‚Äôve certainly been fucked over by the opposite sex, but a lot of my mates have done the same to some genuinely nice women. 

As a single male, I wonder about the MGTOW movement and if it is too extreme of an ideology for me. Don‚Äôt mind the GMOW part, since that is the life I tend to lean towards as an introvert, but I love my mother, and sisters, and have met genuinely kind women.]


Hopefully some of you in this sub can answer this without me being banned first. I‚Äôm looking for camaraderie with people who aren‚Äôt so relationship focused and driven by the need for someone else in their life to make them happy, but MGTOW might be too extreme or me."

I  am one of those dude who thinks we men are not that oppressed as the  MGTOW subreddit or redpill portay. I agree some part of the relationship  issue. Where some men are treated unfairly. Other than that the  subreddit is full of negative generalizing of feminist, liberals, mass  media etc.

254,rationalthought314,This wouldn't be necessary any more than MGTOW itself if not for the current situation we find ourselves in. Men would not be bitching here about the MGTOW subreddit if not for the shitty arbitrary behavior of the current mods over there while many men would not be going mgtow if not for the shitty behavior of many women and the overall system that is highly unfair.
255,Memekip,"Yep 

I'm all for male independence, but I feel that constantly going around in a circlejerk of hating women just proves that the people who hang out there are clearly not over it. Being one sided and keeping an eye out for only bad women which fit the narritive in your head is just asking to get into a toxic mindset imo: vicareously playing the victim of a minority of women who play the victim to take advantage of men

It's a subreddit about independent men that discusses women 90% of the time. Which is kind of the opposite of the sub's title"

Well idk, either because I‚Äôm a chick or because I genuinely was trying to understand their logic- or both.. probably both.

I had pointed out that I was gaslighted by my ex boyfriend and somehow found myself at 19 years old paying all the rent, all the groceries, and meanwhile my ex boyfriend five years older than me- lying, cheating, and spending his money on a new bong or Xanax addiction- I was trying to point out that it wasn‚Äôt because he‚Äôs a man that he‚Äôs a shitty manipulative person.. 

I‚Äôm all for men feeling empowered without women.. but I found myself at mgtow because just like with ‚Äúman haters‚Äù, neither gender should be held accountable for the world‚Äôs problems, or an individual‚Äôs problems.. and I was wondering what kind of logic they use since it does seem they blame women for all the world‚Äôs problems. 

I‚Äôd argue a lot of women‚Äôs problems are culturally pushed on women by other women, and same with men. 

And also, I have more male friends than female friends... like the two genders aren‚Äôt strictly romance based... but mgtow makes it out to be just a biological reproductive thing between the genders.. platonic relationships are important."

What I am trying to say is a lot of these issues are to do with partners not matching ( ugly or ugly etc) and the capitalist system which is destroying the environmental and sociological spheres of life. We need to truly look at what we NEED in life not what we want. Because right now basic needs are not being met by 60% of the population. We are all connected and have the ability as a species to inflict pain on someone else emotionally and even subconsciously.

293,In_This_Here_Economy,"MGTOW went to shit for the exact same reason feminism did: the reactionary, fringe elements have become the leading voices of the movement.  I don't share the beef with feminism that a lot of MGTOW men believe that they have to have.  I know and understand that feminism, at it's core, is just as much about dismantling gender roles for men as it is women.  If I am to be honest, it was actual feminism that taught me self respect as a man and why I was compelled to a lot of the behaviors and concepts of myself, women and the world that I had, and that reason is patriarchy.  The same men who brag about how it's been primarily men who've created civilizations and governments are the same ones who deny the existence of patriarchy unironically and under the spell of cognitive dissonance.

It's ridiculous, actually.  

The most important thing, I think, for a man to remember is that he doesn't have to hate women to recognize and respect himself as a human being, and he doesn't have to hate himself to recognize and respect the humanity of women."

I've been banned from dozens of subreddits, especially LGBTs, feminists, cuckoldery fetishists, adulteries, affair advices, cheating experiences, and I'm cool with getting banned from there, because they are my ""enemy"" territory, getting banned from there is EXPECTED. 
but when i got banned from mgtow? hell no, i wasn't expecting that. i was a men's right activist and a mgtow commentator at the time, and i always considered manosphere my FRIENDLY territory (except PUA and Incels, we don't share much in common) but i never expected a BAN from mgtow. 
the problem is, they won't tell you WHY they banned you and they'll never give you a SECOND chance ever again.
so if the moderators don't want to give a fuck about banned members, why should banned members give a fuck about them? 
and again, they're NOT the OFFICIAL mgtow, as they have confessed it themselves in subreddit. 

but after that, i can't trust any FRIENDLY territory anymore.

Or if it was for telling people to read the article in a linked post and not the narrative driven synopsis that someone made.

Basically the synopsis said the woman got away with the crime, she was released no charges.  But the article said she was re arrested, charged with multiple crimes, and was undergoing a psych evaluation.

334,Implausible-asset,"I can tell you why I avoid women 24/7. Speaking only for myself:

1. Marriage is a raw deal for men. Everyone knows this. I dont want to subject myself to that kind of slavery.

2. Dating and girlfriends: Every girlfriend I've had has either cheated on me with someone who had more money or a better position in life. Monkey branching. I dont fault them for it now, it's just their nature. And I dont enjoy the feeling of a breakup when I was thinking everything was ok. Casual dating equates to more buying free dinners than romantic reward, and it's expensive I'd rather use those resources on my self. Also the breakup psycho factor. Consensual sex and turn into a rape claim that without any investigation at all can ruin your life. No thank you 

3. Women in the workplace: I am 100% professional all the time, and make sure I'm never alone with one. A false claim to HR about touching her butt or her being offended by a joke  can have you out on your ass faster than 5pm comes on a holiday weekend. It's not worth the risk.

4. Day to day life: they only talk to you if they want something from you. And I dont want to give them anything. I want to do what I want to do. 

Staying away from women keeps me focused, energized, and moving forward. It's the way I mgtow, and mgtow is freedom. "
335,thalobby,They're probably afraid of getting #metoo'd
336,NathanHollister,"Un, that's the point of MGTOW. No women= no chance of having your money stolen, no chance of getting metood, no chance of returning to the plantation"
337,-Ecliptic-,anything besides hardcore female hate will get you banned sooner or later.
338,Yasai101,I agree
339,xpillx,"Ohhh I think I know why I got banned from reading mgtow vs mgtow2 topic. There was a thread some mgtow made and he posted a sexbot and said he would rather fuck that than a real woman. I was instantly wronged about it. I said something like:
""I dunno man... stuff like that creeps me out. Id rather fuck my hand watching porn or fuck a real woman (escort or maybe relationship but no marriage).""

I think thats healthy mindset and my preferance. Seems like those sweaty losers got triggered and banned me lmao."
340,jasonmiles2014,It is really incredible the vitriol being spouted there.  Failing to adhere strictly to their holier than thou philosophies will lead to you being called every name imaginable.

344,squiddy_s550gt,I got heavily downvotesd for the same thing on my previous alt
345,,That's the issue. Anything to fit the narrative that women are evil. How is that any different than what a feminist does to men. 
346,rw032697,"Exactly, occasionally I would comment ""w-who hurt you?"" like seriously just a bunch of people getting betrayed or dumped or rejected. "
347,Jmick1090,"Well just got banned today. Here is the post the got me banned.

348,Impossible-asset,"The mods are more sympathetic towards the angry Male/woman blaming crowd than the men who are trying to apply gyow philosophical and lifestyle ideas. 

So when someone says anything that isnt in line with that narrative, the OP or commenter is reported and banned. 

It's unfortunate to see it go in that direction, because it makes it annoying to sort through 50 posts of bullshit to find one good solid post about mgtow."
349,choosey-lover,Mods wake up in the morning and decide to choose hate instead of love. Everyone makes this choice themselves every day.

I talked sense. Bashed the trolls and I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs banned.

356,ViolentJenniferLopez,I would not doubt if there are subverted mods after hitting 100k. Reddit is shady.
357,sikki_nixx,Yes
358,mgtowthrowaway255,"Yeah I got banned that way too. I asked the mods and they never replied.

&#x200B;

Honestly it's not MGTOW. It's either run by simps or wimps, or by women that are purposely messing with men."
359,30203forever,"Look at their 10 ""rules"". They are perfectly within their rights to ban anyone for any reason or no reason at all. It might have worked for a while (and it have) but eventually, the busybodies or people with some really nefarious agenda can (and did) become moderators there.  The real question is ""Why would anyone want to be a member of such club?"""
360,,Yeah it seems like a bunch of Elliot Rogers are starting to infect that sub now. Damn shame. It was good while it lasted.
361,Yasai101,"Amen bro, cant believe they are banning on that sub for expressing opinions. Don't like it don't read it, or better yet dislike the comment, don't ban conversations or viewpoints you fucking snowflakes.

374,Uncle_Vodka_237,"I remember your posts there DrivZone, I was up voting you for them and I support your opinion.

I just got banned for posting in the same place. I'm not sure for what, but I'm guessing it was my post where I stated ""I see no good reason for hating women"" (in the sense that it's a waste of time/energy). Probably seen as white knighting/virtue signalling or some bullshit."
375,zwello,"Yep, it‚Äôs literally the only thing. Every post is about how women are useless and fucking scums of this earth. It‚Äôs a shit show. "

382,Impossible-asset,Cognitive dissonance: don't think one can be mgtow and be married. Pretty sure that puts you into MRA territory. I mean the whole premise of mgtow is men not getting married and exposing themselves to the inherent liabilities of it all.

385,ArmondDillo,"Those cunts use a lot of shady tricks, they were fucking with me for weeks before i finally got outright banned.

They must, themselves, be sons of roast beef whores."
386,In_This_Here_Economy,This.
387,Loban8990,"Something I've been afraid of for the last year or so is MGTOW becoming an echo chamber. There was a time when the sub wasn't so vitriolic. We would share ideas, and hobbies and give advice. I've been a member there since 2014 (this in an alt account). I remember those days."
388,-Entilzha_Valen-,"I'm too the point I think they ban for pretty much any post that gets reported.  So if you cause anyone butthurt and they report you, you get banned."
389,ksimbobbery,Literally worse than incels
390,yermanbob,"It occurs to me that both females and males, of all the flavours of pills, make these sorts of judgements based on their favourite celebrity of the moment.

To me it seams strange basing such a broad opinion on an extremely small evidence base of rich people.

Surely it would be easier to accept that normal people age in different ways, it's mostly dependent on lifestyle choice. Or am I missing something? While genes do play a role I'd argue that money /epigenetics is a far stronger contribution to change.

Perhaps I've had one to many beers?"
391,Dharmathinker,"I agree. Even if there is some things to criticize about modern day women. It does no good at all to spend so much energy and time hating on them.  The idea of mgtow was clearly to focus on self development. and alot of them completely miss that.  

And god for bid you bring up the idea of talking about other things and not women.  Theyll call you names and just defend them selves"
392,30203forever,"All their rules are bullshit and custom-made to be able to ban anyone for any reason or no reason at all. It appears to me though that they especially hate the MGTOW who are out of the red pill rage. No serious discussions allowed, methinks. But hey, I haven't been there for half a year since I got banned and not going back because that sub is as good as gone..."

395,FlourishedCass,Mad preacher lad by any chance?
396,NathanHollister,"In all fairness, it's easy to spread. Just drop redpills on your friends and family. And feminism redpills more men every day as they expand the welfare state and make the laws against men worse (TFM mentioned a woman who got away with stabbing a man, and another who got only 15 months in prison for being complicit in a man's death).

Conversely, having kids just makes one more future feminist. Because odds are good you lose the kid to a feminist wench, or the public school indoctrinates your kid, or college indoctrinates him. Kids are fine, as long as you adopt and homeschool him. Otherwise, he's probably fucked no matter how redpill you are"
397,Implausible-asset,"That's easy. Just apply mgtow philosophy to yourself when other men see you succeeding in life while they are struggling, theyll ask, and you tell them how. 

It's easy as that. Men know when something isnt working, but they do need to be able to see a logical, clear path out. And that is what mgtow is."
398,Uncle_Vodka_237,"Yep, It will be interesting to see what happens to that sub over time."
399,Tsukikoselenia,"Seems like a common pattern here. It's probably what happens when you go against what a mod thinks when he's in a bad day despite not having broken any rule. 

Which is kind of weird because you don't even have to defend women for this to happen; sometimes he's just triggered by what you were saying and seems to havethe self-control of a child."
400,BoskOfPortKar,WTF
401,AcrobaticAge,"What??? You were one of the few insightful guys there.

I better be prepared to be banned, since I have been openly vocal about how I don't like that sub getting ridden by incels."

403,BluetoothMcGee,Username (and subsequent projection) checks out.
404,XFinalPhantom,"Same, at one point, almost made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt Mgtow. But then I realized that it‚Äôs moderators who are assholes. Mgtow is a great train of thought, but we look no better than feminists. Sometimes I feel like they want women dead just like feminists want men dead. It‚Äôs toxic, I feel that not all women are bad, but marriage and relationships never worked to begin with. It‚Äôs society hoping for something to be true when it‚Äôs not in human nature."
405,Uncle_Vodka_237,"Man, I'll tell ya. Reading that shit makes me so fucking glad I've given up on relationships.

> I hate myself, I hate this, I hate how complicated relationships are.

I agree with you when you say both genders are susceptible to having relationship doubts. Those incels only want to see it one way. All women are cancer etc..."
406,DatingTank,"Lol, it was that same post that spiraled me to a ban. I just can't shut up when something is clearly fake or wrong, but people keep using it to confirm a narrative. It's exactly the same that the worst SJWs are known for. It's a shame they're not holding it to a higher standard in there. It's becoming increasingly toxic."
407,DJDickJob,"It really is a shame, that sub used to be awesome. I learned a lot from that place and felt like sharing my own stories might help younger guys gain some insight, but I got banned for agreeing with someone that said MGTOW1 had started to seem sexist. I added that I think it's because a lot of incels have come here, and got immediately banned. I had been active on there for like 1.5 years and never had any problems. There's a special place in internet hell for all these bitch ass corrupt mods and admins."

410,MParry6,Pretty much what I got banner for. IG related post saying men are bad on it too.
411,Impossible-asset,Why am I not surprised at all to that nonsense on mgtow. Has nothing to do with  mgtow at all.
412,Impossible-asset,"I'll leave it up because:
1. If that's what you did to get banned from the mgtow sub, then that's what you did.
2. Please do not repeat that sort of behavior here.this is not a sub to engage in inflammatory commentary on
 Thank you."
413,ksimbobbery,"That just makes you a bad, hateful person"
414,MParry6,"It used to be about literally checking out and gong your own way. Now, with over 100k subs, it‚Äôs become some sort of mutated top trumps, women are pure scum zone that is so full of negativity and anger, it doesn‚Äôt help anything.

If you want to kill something, make it popular."
415,Impossible-asset,"Welcome to mgtow. The 2 is incidental...

It's not a movement, it's a sub where we try and foster active conversation amongst men who are going there own way. 

The mods spend a *slight* bit of time trying to curate it constantly so it stays focused on the positive. 

For the bad stuff if it gets through, that report button and the good old downvote button used properly is a big help. 

Enjoy it here and hope to read your good contributions."
416,Booksarepricey,A lot of it is just human nature. The negatives of it get lumped in as descriptors of the groups of people we don't like. It's incredibly polarizing.
417,,"Yeah. Those guys are getting unstable with every passing day. There was a post for people to talk about their difficult childhoods on that sub. Guess what? Those motherfuckers had to come and ruin that. A particular asshat called me my father's bitch cuz my father treated me like shit and said I'd go back kissing his ass when I need him.

What a toxic shitshow of a sub. I just replied to the bastard and reported his comments. There are too many assholes who hide behind their devices and talk shit on the sub.

I'm thinking of unsubbing from that crapwaste."
418,theanchorman05,Whoever the mods are have some power issues.  I hope they're not cops in real life.....

425,Implausible-asset,"I get it why they discuss women. Keyword being discuss. 
You have talk about what women do and their behaviors and how it affected you. It's good, its healthy. And it helps other men who may be stuck in similar situations find their way out of it. 

But what they do over there now is just bash bash bash women all the time but they dont offer solutions, advice, or success stories. "
426,-Ecliptic-,"I got banned for pointing out they are the flipside of the SJW coin.  They were bitching about Captain Marvel being to SJW because of female lead...

The time before that banned for pointing out they hate Game of Thrones because it has a few strong female characters.

It's hilarious how they bitch about the stereotype and then work so damned hard to live down to it."
427,glitchyjoe64,When you become actual meninists 
428,SleepyMethHead,"Just like you opened yourself to be hurt by that man... us men do the same thing with women. We just do it for different reasons. 

But like in any sub reddit you‚Äôll likely get banned if your going against the sentiment within that bubble of thought.

I agree platonic relationships are important, but they are hard to sustain. Friends I have that are girls disappear when they get into relationships 9/10 times and I hate when they breakup and want to be my friend again. But yes I enjoy female friends."
429,nbjmcclellan,"Next time try pm‚Äôing some user you see posting, MGTOW isn‚Äôt women friendly because it is men going their own way, not everyone going there own way. But if you‚Äôd like to pm me and ask about it feel free, I‚Äôm an avid humanitarian and a huge fan of almost all of what MGTOW stands for."
430,BluetoothMcGee,"You wanna know why you were banned? It's because it's blatantly obvious that you didn't read [anything from](https://archive.fo/wCyUm) [the sidebar](https://archive.is/xPOqz) or the rules of the subreddit and instead chose to be yet another one of our run-of-the-mill trolls who does exactly what we expected: start drama and conflict masquerading as a ""debate"", and when called out, proceed to shame, project, and gaslight. You weren't ""genuinely"" trying to understand us. At all. No one bought your BS. And of course you're here portraying yourself as the victim of the banning that you yourself have initiated. It's almost like clockwork.

And you wonder why we pledged to stay away from your gender as far as possible."
431,,"Originally MGTOW was more of a safe haven for men who have given up on women/traditional relationships. We dedicate the remainder of our lives to self satisfaction. I have no problems getting girls/laid/relationships, I'm just no longer intrested. 

Now the Incels (those who simply cannot get laid for the life of them) start claiming to be MGTOW, and spewing toxic female hate comments, have really ruined the face of the community. 

MGTOW2 is very humble and less interested in bashing women. I am open to discuss female nature, tactics, AWALT, but I don't hate them for being what they are. Its about us, not them. 

I was banned for my comments in MGTOW and really dont care. This sub is the true face of rhw community, and represents what it stands for. "
432,Talkytalktalk,"globalist coq, u mean.  too many globalist libertarians stinkin up mgtow.  mgtow is politically diverse, as long as you're a globalist libertarian."
433,Impossible-asset,Mgtow is normal. Its self-preservation. That's how its grown like it has. Lots of guys just doing what they need to survive.
434,Trek13,"your history and mine are pretty much the same.   Was on r/mgtow from around 20K users to around 100K.   When they banned me (the second time) I pretty much knew why.  Didn't ask why, just sent them a ""thank you"" note.   Needed the clean break from too much toxic negative shit."
435,Impossible-asset,Follow your own example and leave out the angry politics please. Thank you.
436,-Entilzha_Valen-,"If you claim to be MGTOW and are voting democrat, that may be the most blatant case of voting against your own interests ever.  Considering it‚Äôs the Democrats who keep passing all these laws that shit on men and ALWAYS support women over men, facts be damned.

EDIT:  The Republicans, may not go out of their way to help men, but at least the aren‚Äôt actively hostile to us."
437,vsamarda,"I'm not mgtow, but I just find it strange how so many people on a sub that's all about going your own way and not focusing on relationships spend their entire time hating women and calling them names and focusing on their hate instead of bettering themselves."

449,BoskOfPortKar,You were criticizing Vilar's work or a female on the post ?
450,Spike-Ball,"Thank you for this. I was really interested in MGTOW at first, until I spent some time on the sub Reddit and saw by far mostly posts that focused on hating women. Hating women makes them just as bad as the extreme feminists that hate men. The existence of one justifies the other, and perpetuates it.

I thought it was great to see posts showing a member enjoying their life and doing something fun, until they make additional effort just to hate on women within the same post. And of course they ban anyone that criticizes or calls out their bullshit."
451,Impossible-asset,"We do not ban users lightly. Obvious and repeated trolling, calls for violence, spam, and bots, yeah that'll catch a ban.  

I spend a lot of time removing posts that dont meet sidebar rules (please everyone read and follow them), and sometimes it's a judgement call on my part. 

But using bans as a downvote button? No."

456,throwawayapparently9,"to be honest, as a former mgtow user (got banned of course) I'm still a little misogynistic. not in the way you think, i don't want to cleanse the earth from women, no. but take a look at my posts history to see how many bad women are out there. 
i just can't look at women the same way i used to look before becoming red pilled.
it's just not worth the risk for me."

However, the occasional angry post amongst red pill knowledge posts and men's rights issues, seasoned with links to some amazing MGTOW channels is far from that. 

If we take huMAN as an example, he is calm most of the time so the rare anger-jerks undermined with cusses are really impactful and memorable. "

Honestly, a lot of the things posted there would cause those men to get fired if their employers saw it. That would explain why they ban people who make sense.

MGTOW is married to the idea that you'll be happier without solipsistic women in it. But you become self-serving solipsistic yourself. You also become utterly miserable without fulfilling your biological imperative. It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons. 

Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men. So what's the difference? Because all I see is men like this too. Especially MGTOW men who aren't interested in building community. I spent a year trying to build a community around MGTOW with users and they were never interested. All they want to do is moan about women all day. 

MGTOW doesn't make you happy. Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving. Society as an whole has become too big. Where as men and women would thrive in smaller communities. There are too many issues just to blame it all on women. And as society increases so does its lack of empathy and the feeling you are just a number. So better to build small communities.

I do not agree with that and feminism is actually damaging woman on the long road. Just as men are *better* in natural fields, woman have insticts and operate on levels unimaginable for men. Man can be Simping for years and could not see it but woman will notice the shit much more quickly. You can lie a woman for a year but to a man awhole life. They have *antennas* or special instincts (mother instincts) that cannot be accessed by pure logic and intellect.

567,,">The idea of MGTOW isn't about building a community. 

The fact that it's a community based subreddit that states to its members that it's nothing to do with community goes to show you that it is utterly self-serving. How is that any different than any woman or man you meet today in society?

MGTOW just plays into the narcissistic division segregationist society. It literally says, ""Okay society, you win! Now let me get my fill"" and instead becomes exactly what nihilist society wants in a MGTOW's own image. 

How did I draw that conclusion? That chase of career. The chase for material. Elliot Hulse said it better that ""I'm with you MGTOW but you focus too much on the matter. The mother world. The material.""

And I believe he is right to some extent. There's no harm in bettering your career but if that's all you do and all you aspire it material, what is your legacy? 

>Being self-serving doesn't mean I'm harming anyone else in the process

Not at all but its essentially why societies collapse. It's a communist-like mindset. And as the population grows into self-serving narcissism so does the utter disdain and divide amongst people. 

>MGTOW has made me happier than I've ever been, so I don't know what you mean by that. 

It's all about how it makes you feel. Which is the issue with this society. It's always self-entitled. Self-centered thinking about its own self. It doesn't want to better the lives of those around them. It is one degree away from feminism.

>Learning to not depend on anyone but myself for happiness is the biggest step I've taken in my entire life. The fact that there are shitty people from both genders has nothing to do with why MGTOW is still relevant.

MGTOW is relevant in a nihilist society. I've come to the conclusion its a way of coping and becoming just like modern women. Which only serves to divide and segregate everyone. 

But you never see MGTOWs want to get together and build a community. All you get is, ""MGTOW is about your own path"" And being surrounded by self-serving entitled men just reminds me of a male version of feminism. 

What beyond the basics of don't get married and be careful does MGTOW provide? There's no pearls of wisdom beyond a few YouTubers. Majority of golden posts are from The Red Pill and books that don't follow the self-serving approach.

And MGTOW can't even do what they set out to do anyway. They focus too much on negative female experience. They talk about women all day on MGTOW1 and how much monsters they are. They give women their power away by making them the boogeyman/woman.

Atleast The Red Pill aspires for community. Atleast it brings men into its fold and looks after them within their small community. MGTOW does nothing but worship the self. And that's how we got here in the first place.

So you can say MGTOW has helped you. Perhaps it has. But I didn't come here to serve myself. I came here for brotherhood because without it any community inevitably collapses. Just like the PUA community did.  Stronger together, divided we fall. And it will always be this way. A community without guidance is going nowhere. 
"
568,Impossible-asset,"One thing that is an important consideration when you are talking about the principle of ""AWALT"" (all women are like that). It is pointless to bring up ""NAWALT"" (not all women are like that), because unless someone is genuinely disturbed in the head, they will know that out of the 4 billion women on the earth, it is not even statistically possible that every single one will be an ""awalt"" type. 

The whole reason that AWALT is even a saying is because there is enough of a risk in dating, relationships, and marriage today that AWALT is a reminder of a real danger you face as a man. 

If I were given a 50 gallon drum of apples, and only 10 of them were poisonous, but the only way to tell the poisonous ones from the good ones is after I take a bite, I wouldn't be worried about what my odds are of ""finding a good apple"". I'd slap a big warning label ""DANGER: POISONOUS APPLES, DO NOT EAT"" on the side, and leave the whole thing out by the dumpster for trash pickup. 

That's what AWALT is. It's a warning that engaging in an activity has many detriments, and few benefits. It's not a scientific statement. 

Many guys get stuck in being angry after being on the receiving end of a ""poisonous apple"" when it comes to women. And so they choose to walk away from that in the future. Some stay angry, which is what I am hoping to help get them out of by having a sub like this where they can talk with other mgtow men about how they can move on successfully. The other mgtow sub is for staying stuck in the anger side of things. 

What women do mgtow men want? well, depends. When it comes to marriage and cohabitation, the answer is none. For myself, I extend that to girlfriends, dating, and any non-professional relationship. Though some mgtow men are open to that."
569,Deadpanpancakes,"Its not so much that there are a few ""good women"". I think looking at people through the lens of good and bad are too simplistic. People as a general rule are selfish and self serving. Obviously it is to a degree that doesnt jeopardize other things they want. Also, people tend to delude themselves into thinking that they arent ""wrong or bad"" when they want to justify doing something that is pretty abhorrent. Im more concerned about the society around us that holds women to many double standards or the fact that theres sometimes no recourse for a man and nobody seems to give a shit.  You take the shaky moral relativistic nature of women and their selfish attitude and combine it with the male hating legal system and you get men opting out because it is the reasonable thing to do."

I'm opposed to the idea that you have to ""hit the gym bro"" or make a lot of money, I don't live by those types of principles. I mean, if that's what you want to do, then go for it, but material things like that have nothing to do with the point of MGTOW. "

>  Something shady went down at mgtow1 a few months ago...


Yes. Outbreak of manginitis. "
573,Jmick1090,"This guy is trying to bullshit you.

>MGTOW is married to the idea

This is psychological word play.

>You also become utterly miserable without fulfilling your biological imperative.

This is an out right lie. Having a woman does not make a man happy. If you are a miserable man when you have a woman you will just be a miserable man with pussy.

>It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons.

It does matter that not all women are evil as you say. There are plenty of evil women to go around and all it takes is one to destroy a man's life.

>Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men

This is the men and women are equal lie. Why? Because lets say you have 2 children, the one every time he does something wrong you punish and the other child you allow to do what ever he wants. Who do you think is going to be well behaved the child that was getting punished every time he did something wrong or the child that you did not punish when he did something wrong? It's obvious that it's going to be the child that was getting punished when he did something wrong. In our case men are being punished and women are being allow to go unpunished or get a slap on the wrist. Just look at
all the women that have falsely accused men of rape for example. When was the last time you heard of a man falsely accusing a woman of rape? There is no way men and women are going to act the same when women have the state backing them and men just have
themselves backing them. Also men and women are different so they are not going act the same. Men were the protectors and providers because men think others. Just look what happens when there is a catastrophe. It's men that jump into rescue others at a risk to their own lives.

>All they want to do is moan about women all day.

What this guy is effectively saying is if you're going way why do you talk about women so much. The reason men need to talk about female nature is because we are trying to help other young men not to fall into the traps women and society are trying to get young men to fall into.

>Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving.

Obviously men are going to start becoming self-serving. What did you expect men to be generous when women are so selfish? So men should just continue to give and give and give while women continue to abuse men?

>Society as an whole has become too big

So this guy is into eugenics.

>There are too many issues just to blame it all on women

MGTOWS don't blame all issues on women. We know simps are also part of the problem too.

BTW: This guy is not a mgtow."

I understand why they got upset, but I thought they'd at least fight that instinct with the whole going your own way bit. Not everyone who breaks away from the norm and goes their own way is going to go away they feel is preferred.

You don't need to embrace femininity though. We live in a time that people say you need to accept who you are as if that is unchangeable. I tried to just embrace it when I was a feminist and one day I looked at myself and felt like I was a caricature, that 'leaning into it' was just as much an act as trying to hide it.

There is a similar movement that says we need to accept our bodies as they are, but that isn't true. There are certain parts of you that you shouldn't try to force a change on, aspects that deal with your emotional well being and your happiness. But the way you pose, the way you speak, the words you use, how you dress, those are easily  changed things and more than one path can make you happy. These aren't 'who you are'.  These are just the cosmetics of behavior, things that can be easily changed to suit who you want to become."

648,drops_of_Sunshine,"Absolutely loved it! Most modern blockbusters lack the ability to connect us to the character, MCU and Star Wars (Disney) are so fast paced and filled to the brim with jerk-neck transitions and action that I find it incredibly hard to soak it in the way I could with movies from the early 2000s. 

This film had a stillness to it that I particularly enjoyed, you felt each moment of the journey, you were uncomfortable when they were, scared, sad, you felt the emotions of the character on screen and when I walked out, I felt sort of somber, and reflective, the way I do after finishing a good book. 1917 used music effectively, there were lots of quiet moments, and some really beautiful shots as well, but I never got the impression the film was trying too hard to show off visually. 

Went and saw it by myself, and very glad I did! I don't watch reviews or trailers, but apparently it's been hyped up. I've since recommended it to all my friends."

How the Anazacs wouldn't salute the British officers, how he got lucky when a shell obliterated all the men near him. The screams from no mans land during the night.

You‚Äôre right; driving on that farm reduced some of the risks. Something could have gone horribly wrong as well. I knew what the risks were, so I took my chances. In a city environment it would be a very different experience. You have to weigh up the risks versus the benefits, and do your best to stay safe."

My mom used to do it to me. She'd give me points for doing good things like getting good grades, helping her around the house, helping dad with his office work etc.

And then I could use these to buy myself things, like a new toy helicopter, or a bike or a game boy or something.

But the difference is, I was fucking 5 years old and this is a grown ass man, who I presume makes his own money. 

It made sense when my mom did it to 5 year old me, and I'm thankful she did that, she and dad taught me about managing responsibility and the value of hard work among other things.

I'm 19 now and my mom and dad don't do it anymore, since they know that the system has outlived its usefulness

If a man said to his friends ""I'd like to go, but I better not, my wife wouldn't like it!"", his friends would probably laugh, and understand.

If a woman said to her friends ""I'd like to go, but I better not, my husband wouldn't like it!"", her friends would be concerned and ask ""Is everything okay at home? Are you being bullied?"""

With America's steady rise in popularity in terms of entertainment and politics over the decades, people all over the world have been increasingly made more ""western"", which translates into taking in all the bad points of being an american.

Even in countries like mine which couldn't be further from US, both geographically, and socially, you can see the cancer of western feminism creeping in and breaking society from the inside.

It's difficult to think where feminism is going right now, but for me, feminism as a movement became redundant by the year 2000. Hey, atleast you don't have to worry about fake allegations right?"
774,rquasius,"I've said it before and I think Jordan Peterson has too.   The only way this problem with Western women will get solved at this point is if SANE women start countering the wackiness of the 3rd wave feminism being spawned.  Because you posting here is preaching to the choir.  Some women are standing up, like  Bettina Arndt,  Karen Straughan  and others.

I think modern society breeds mental illnesses and social media just throws fuel on the fire, the more I examine modern life the more I feel like it impacts all of us in a negative way at one point or another, man, woman, straight , gay, whatever alphabet letters one likes modern society will shit on you at some point.

810,,"The problem is that the extreme majority of women who are anti-feminists still want all the power and privileges feminism has brought them.  They are against feminism for victimizing men (and for being crazy), but just as strongly against removing things that give them advantages and power.  Such as legal preference in child custody and alimony and the stupidly easy divorce laws, etc.  And when I say ""legal preference"" I mean that the woman is by default the legal provider to the child and so there are actually men out there who pay their ex-wife child support even though the men in question have custody of the child.

Basically, most women who are anti-feminism are pro-girl power.  Which is feminism just without being openly anti-male.  Feminism = anti-male to get power, girl power = pro female to get power.  The power and privileges and dominance they want is the same, they just try to get it by being nice instead of by being hostile."

813,,"It'll probably catch up with them during their performance evals, but that's an year out."
814,,"Hmm, my observation hasn't quite been that. I'm friends with two gay men who've shared their very deep misgivings about the metoo movement, and the ""liberal"" left in general. One of them is a libertarian voting white man, while the other is a Republican voting latino man. One of the my other trans friends is openly pro-Trump, who she sees as the only person who's crazy enough to stand up to the ""liberal"" left (her words, not mine).

On the larger screen there are groups like Gays for Trump who are definitely not aligned with #metoo folks.

As all of you know, there's a personal and professional cost to not being on board with these liberal movements. Especially if you're living in a large, ""liberal"" city, it can be very isolating for LGBT people to be vocal about their beliefs about these catchy-named movements which lack any substance. Not making any justifications though  


Though overall -- I do agree with you. Most of the LGBT people around me have bought the idea that they're ""oppressed"" because all of their ridiculous demands aren't met."
815,,"Genuine question - how do you think I could've stopped getting the award? 

I shared here because I wanted to get it off my chest and fwiw, this seemed like the only place a post like this would be tolerated (even with a throwaway account). Do you think I was treated more positively because I was a woman? If yes, how could I have stopped that?"
816,,"Skepticism is very healthy, especially of things online.

I mentioned elsewhere that I do believe I got and still get special treatment. I despise that, but most of the time it's out of my hands. Those who know me will vouch for the fact that I don't seek it out.

I do think I can be metooed falsely. False allegations of this kind are usually made by people who are mentally unbalanced, and there is no scarcity of psychological issues in the lesbian community. I've had one very close encounter with something like that. I'd share it, but I feel I've shared too much identifying information already, and I don't want to get doxxed.

I'd probably get 50/50 custody ... unless my ex could spin my lack of support for feminism into something evil. I don't know, and I don't want to find out.

Our experiences are definitely different. But that doesn't mean that I can't see absolute abuse of the social and judicial systems at the hands of these women. I have seen more things than I've written here. It's not just about me receiving shit at the hands of women."

818,,"I have to make sure that I'm not being put in leadership positions just because I'm a woman. I've actually been offered to lead teams in areas I'm not comfortable in, and it's a bit of a pickle trying to figure out how to weasel myself out of it without ruffling feathers or causing drama. If I say that I don't think I'm capable enough for the role, people seem to want to ""encourage"" me (because women need encouragement?) 

Luckily, the team I'm with right now, I'm fully certain that I'm a right fit for them, and they for me (at least till six months ago, when they hired the other two women). I know I'd be miserable if I were in a position I wasn't qualified or capable of being in, and I'd fight that tooth and nail. I take pride in my work, and I derive a lot of my self esteem from doing a good job at whatever I do -- I'd hate it to be taken away from me.

This is precisely why I'm against how programs advocating more diversity in tech fields are structured. It just makes everyone miserable.

Having said that, I'm sure I have received opportunities because I was a woman. The prominent one that comes to mind is that I funded my graduate studies partially off a women-only scholarship. I'm not sure how I feel about that. On one hand, I feel that if someone wants to pay money to a certain group of people, they should be allowed to do that. On the other hand, it sucked very bad to see my male peers go through financial difficulties I didn't have to go through, for the most part (though all of us, men and women, were broke, to various degrees, in grad school)"

A nitpick with how you phrased this: I think most women have no idea that MGTOW exists. 

Women and **men** discount MGTOW when they initially hear about it because it goes against the current narrative: men should get married, or at least pursue women, so that they can be happy(!) 

I think the kick-back against MGTOW is through a genuine desire to help men achieve happiness(!) by getting married. 'Won't you be lonely', etc. Painting it as though women hate MGTOW because it teaches men to put himself first is too broad a brush. Certainly some women might see it that way, but for the majority of women who hear about MGTOW: their criticisms of MGTOW are similar to men's criticisms."

That wasn't long ago. And for the most part, it's business as usual in this feminist society, but the cracks are present. 

What I predict will happen is either society will self correct completely, making gender distinction once again fashionable and even marketable. A push back mechanism against this gender neutrality. This could make this whole gender war just a cringe phase in our history. There's still room for ""Something in between"" in this. 

Another possibility is the eventual elimination of traditional roles or behavior models attached to sex. This is the ultimate end game of this feminist agenda. 

Either is a solid possibility. Humans are a highly programmable species. Our sense of morality and normality changes over time, and if things continue as they are now, it's inevitable."

Also many people knowingly behave in a hypocritical manner as a way to advance socially. Not everyone has morals and behaves in an ethical manner. Think middle management types and office personnel.

-
Ayup... I have noted that many, **many** times within my comments in /r/MGTOW.
-
Even came up with a term for them: they're not so much MGTOW as they are the **""Ex""-**Men -- as in **""Ex""**-husbands (the ones who were married & got divorce-raped) and **""Ex""**-boyfriends (the ones who were just cohabiting or in some other ""LTR"" short of the official-legal paperwork) -- and generally speaking they're just going through their *""I'm DONE with women! [And THIS time I really mean it!!]""* phase.

-
I've also noted that -- per both statistics on divorced guys, and my anecdotal observations of men in general -- THAT stage typically lasts anywhere from a month to about a year or so (maybe a bit longer if it was a ""brutal"" breakup or devastating divorce-rape) -- before they start ""testing the waters"" (flirting, eyeing up women to at least potentially ""date"" or ""hookup"" with, logging onto {or back onto} Tinder, etc)...

-
And then, in about 2/3 of the cases, within 5 years they're ""remarried"" again (in scare quotes because they MIGHT just ""cohabit"" instead, avoiding the official-legal paperwork, as if that will save their arse)... with **most** of the remaining 1/3 just taking a bit longer (possibly having one or more ""aborted midstream"" attempts at relationships that fell short of an actual LTR/cohabit/marriage).

-
Overall, I'd bet that LESS than 1/10 (~10%) of them **actually** manage to live the rest of their lives as *true* ""MGTOW"" -- they're just TOO habituated to either the sex and/or the ""in a relationship"" identity, etc -- and too ILL-equipped to actually ""go it alone."""

873,Frelsi_8899,"I view most women this way. 

Here's an experiment. 

Try to have female friends where the quality of the friendship is on par with your guy friends. Suspend any sexual desires, and just try to have a friendship. 

It's when you start holding women accountable to the same standard as men. When your expectations of their behavior are the same as men, that's when you'll start seeing the core problems. 

Most of them are psychotic. Most can barely keep an actual conversation. Most cannot escape their nature and cannot fathom you in any other context outside that of utility. Regardless of your best efforts to befriend a female with any hope of forming a normal friendship. Disappointingly you'll end up just being that nice shoulder to cry on. 

You'll quickly fall into the stereotypical bullshit where you sit around listening to her relationship woes. Until she's vented enough, has a paradigm shift and now has no need for the dynamic of the relationship she pushed. So she will drop you. 

Sorry to say this, but we only ended up in this shitstorm thanks to feminism. In our school days, we had it right. Most of us weren't friends with girls. We had a saying ""Chicks are for banging"". 

I'm 42 now, and yeah I even have a few female friends. They're all ""normal"" by female standards, but when you get closer they're flakey, self-absorbed and frankly a bit insane."

And then the irony of it is that the ""new"" one they eventually pick -- choose or fall for or end up with depending on how you look at it/label it -- is often (and we're talking *blatantly/obviously*) ***cut from the same EXACT cloth*** as the one they just divorced/got divorce-raped by/were alternating between crying & raging & grieving over just a year or so prior when they were in their reactionary (faux-MGTOW) ""I'm DUN with women!"" stage/phase.

-
We're talking almost IDENTICAL... as in even down to their NAMES\*...
-
So they divorce and/or get divorced by *Louisa* (that bitch, can you believe she cheated with the NEIGHBOR, expected to be forgiven and for hubby to still be NICE to that neighbor?)... but then FF a couple of years and who do they hookup with and marry but a 2x divorcee (with kids and thus one or more of her ""ex/baby-daddy"" guys nearby), and she is named... wait-for-it... *Luisa!*  

-
WTF? That's like trading off an old used Chevy because, well *""it got dented up in an accident""* and you just CAN'T STAND the idea of driving a dented up car (etc) -- but then going out and buying **another** old used Chevy, except one that's even MORE dented up because it's been in *multiple* accidents (and from the looks of it possibly even driven in a ""demolition derby"").

-
Moreover, while there usually ARE some -- relatively superficial -- differences (i.e. the first wife was a blonde, the second a brunette, etc) when it comes to voice & speaking pattern, inflections/accent, even general overall behavior & ""character"" of the person... DESPITE the insistence of the guy that ""this one is DIFFERENT from the other one""; the resemblance is sort of ""uncanny""

-
A half dozen guys that I know PERSONALLY (as in been friends either with them or with their families for decades) have followed that EXACT same pattern\*\*... it's to the point that I figure one can PREDICT (with something like at least, *if not better than,* 50% accuracy) both when and who (name/character) they WILL ""partner up with"" again in fairly short order.

-
**But to get back to YOUR point...**
-
Yes I'd say you're correct in that it is somewhere *around* if not ***more than half*** of the guys on various MGTOW forums (/r/MGTOW and /r/MGTOW2 especially) who follow that pattern.

---

And then, as you said at the end of your prior comment:

>>On the other had you have guys like me that aren't mad, we just don't give a sh!t.

EXACTLY.
-
Unfortunately... because MGTOW forums are virtually the LAST ""male space"" that allows such bitching *(sort of the same as why the guy being cheated on/divorced ends up calling his [never-married] BACHELOR buddy at 2AM*\*\*\**)* -- we end up getting painted with the brush of THEIR ""blue pill raging."" (And while **WE** calmly, coldly, objectively {and yes often a bit harshly/brutally} talk about the REALITY of female nature {and MALE nature as well, though that is often overlooked/forgotten}; **THEY** {recently or 'in the midst of' divorce/d guys) come in, repeat & exaggerate the points about WIMMIN... in an angry ""red pill"" RAGING-story fashion, bitch about their wives/gf's {especially the ""cheating"" etc}... and so the accusations of ""misogyny"" {which then have some validity}.)

-
Just like the ""incels"" -- the not only NEVER been married, NEVER ""fucked""; but *most often NEVER dated, kissed, or been even the least bit 'intimate' with a female in real life* -- who plop in, MISunderstand what MGTOW is about (often only imbibing and regurgitating the superficial ""meme-pic"" garbage), and thus contribute to the mischaracterization of the whole enterprise.

-
**The TEMPTATION** is to BLAME them... but of course the fault really lies with US (the true/actual/real ""MGTOW"" -- that is time-tested/proven as such); in that **we take PITY on these ""pathetic"" creatures** and let them into our ""clubhouse.""

-

---
\* Which I often have to wonder whether it isn't ""on purpose"" as a sort of safety/insurance -- I mean so long as the name SOUNDS the same, then if in some moment of passion (or memory error) they say their EX's name, well no one will be the wiser -- but regardless, it's rather WEIRD/TELLING that the guy who WAS married to ""Louisa"" ends up marrying a ""Luisa""; or likewise with other name-combos; the guy who divorced ""Cathy"" then marries a ""Katherine"" [Kathy], or yet again from Sarah to Sara, Susan/Suzzane[Susie/Suzie], Mari/Mary & even Marianne/Mary-Anne, Ginny/Jennifer[Jenny], Kristina/Christiana [Kris/Chris & even Krissy/Chrissie etc] and so on...

-
\*\* And there are other elements too: basically the DEPTH/HEIGHT of the ""RAGE"" and/or depression/crying that ensues... is a predictor, **not** of them *truly* becoming or following MGTOW, but rather the opposite; the MORE they rage (or cry, complain, etc -- same thing really) the MORE likely they are to ""return to the plantation"" for round #2 (and #3, etc).

-
\*\*\* Mainly because -- well not only do WE actually ""understand"" the situation (we've seen/heard it dozens if not hundreds of times before) -- but we're the only ones that will (or even practically CAN) actually TAKE their calls... especially at that hour of the day/night.  They DARE not call their other ""married"" buddies (assuming they even have such), lest they create further problems."

Over the last year I definitely see tiredness and bleakness wash over him. To me this reinforced my idea of ""shut up and do."" The time for talking is over. You want to help men? Mentor them, guide them, help them network and get jobs. No need to talk to anyone, that is what females do...sit around and gossip to get another being to do the heavy lifting.

They also have far too much time on their hands and get deeply caught up in first world problems. 

Now a subset of these due to their vindictive nature and misguided compasses are just in it to stir social unrest. Some even might believe they're doing good, but without the intelligence and foresight, they cannot fathom the deeper implications of their agendas and they have no empathy to begin with anyways.

894,,"I specifically said ""in my experience"" for that exact reason. You may have a valid argument if I implied this was a fact in all cases. However, I made it very clear that my statement was based upon pure anecdotal evidence. Why are you so determined to be combative over such a non-issue, anyway? In my observations, that, indeed, is usually the case. That's strictly *my* reality. If you've observed and/or personally experienced differently, that is strictly *your* reality. It doesn't make either of us entirely right or wrong, nor does it suggest that the scenario described in the OP is purely a fabrication that never happens. I was offering a different perspective on the point in the discussion which is based on a false premise; that all single mothers are proud to be single mothers and shamelessly flaunt such a status. 

There are multiple causes of single motherhood where praising said mothers for raising their children alone is appropriate. The example I listed  in my original post is common in my community. Right below that is the father being murdered. Right below that is the father being imprisoned. All of these examples were caused by either the fathers themselves or third parties. The single mothers who manage to raise their kids alone when faced with these situations deserve to be encouraged for it.

On the flip side, single fathers get special attention as well because they go against a negative stereotype that fathers turn deadbeat when they separate from the mothers of their children. They also receive well-deserved praise if they raise their children due to the mother being an addict, imprisoned, or dead. There are many variables to these situations, and frankly, I find it crass and myopic to paint all single mothers with a broad brush because of this."

I would say guys do it to but they are either assholes or being sarcastic and will let you know right away. But even the assholes are rather rare in doing this because they know such behavior could lead to an asswhupping or at least people not wanting to hang around them.

Some single women seem to think they are above society's niceness as though they were a celebrity. They see nothing wrong shit testing their host despite the obvious rudeness of it all.

However there is another reason for it as well. They think being a bitch makes them more attractive because they have been picked up by guys who were jerks to them. It's a reversal of expectations. Girls are used to guys being nice to them so they take it for granted. When a decent looking guy comes along and doesn't kiss her ass, she thinks he must be on a higher tier therefore she finds him more attractive than the nice guys. 

Guys are more used to women being bitches to them or at least cold and indifferent. Guys are just likely to be put out by a bitchy woman either getting angry or losing their self esteem.

918,Heisenbergeffect,">What a lot of women don't realize is that shit tests are only relevant if the guy is actually interested in them. Otherwise they just come off as being assholes, like in your experience. Many of them, especially the attractive ones, simply can't fathom that a guy may not be interested, they're so narcissistic and solipsist it doesn't even cross their mind.

This is extremely true. I don't come from a background of having been screwed over, my marriage never had time to go bad. So i never developed the personal distaste. Thus, i don't avoid women at all except the part of being alone with one.   


But i do see that the more attractive ones are the ones that can't in the least understand why they're not wrapping me around their finger.   


To be honest, If i would say that I have a ""type"" these days.. even though i don't engage.. It would be the plain janes. They are usually much more relaxed about things. And they can often spend a whole evening being just pleasant company. Something a hot woman can't do nearly as often. They tend to get obnoxious or downright hostile when they start feeling the bite of failure."
919,iluvfrostidflaks,"i‚Äôm kind of confused about what a shit test is. my ex wife used to demand i let her go to clubs and hang out with guys etc. is that a shit test? or how about, if i was in an argument or confrontation with a stranger, she would butt in on the stranger‚Äôs side if they were guys. is that a shit test? or how about, she would always make snide/snarky remarks, disagree just to disagree, make disparaging comments daily. is that also a shit test? and what response are these women looking to in these shit tests? my ex never acted this way before we got married. only afterwards did the ugliness start (literally on day 1). i didn‚Äôt give into her bullshit and she eventually took off and filed for divorce. what are they trying to accomplish? find a man who‚Äôs the perfect chump who will tolerate their shittiness for a crumb of pussy?"
920,BoomFreedom,"F, for solipsism."
921,Heisenbergeffect,Thank you!
922,Heisenbergeffect,">d and accomplish big things for yo

Best of luck to you. I really have no good advice for your situation, i'm sure that there are others that can do better. What I do know is that you need to make sure that the finances gets in order. Nothing, and i mean nothing will allow you to be a better father than not having to constantly stress over that.  That breathing room has been my saving grace in so many ways i cannot begin to tell you."
923,ValhallaBoundBoy,I am curious about your story here.
924,Dls95405,"The boy's mother is dead. Not only did you miss that important fact, but now we must assume you are critical of his story, since she is 'non-existent'. So, what's the criticism?"
925,ace_kantrillo,"> My wife passed, and I was left with my son who is 6 now, (he was 3 then)  

Literally the second line in the OP."
926,MementoMordor,"No, shit test is when they try to figure out how you deal with being dissed by them by for example talking your fries or insulting you in a more or less obvious way.
They don't want a push over but they might settle. Just know that a woman who views you as weak will resent you. 

What your woman did was just shitting on you, sorry. 

There are videos about shit test on YouTube and I think The Rational Man (book) explains it too."
927,Uniqueinsult,"The last part made my day a little lighter. Thanks. I'd also like to try to answer your question. As a young man who has seen some shit, I'd say the females get a taste of power every time they do that. It strokes the ego and eats the soul- I did not intend to get philosophical with this. They want to feel like they've made a guy their little chump, to manipulate.
I'd say its quite fashionable for the female to have a little pussy-begger-slave behind her as I see this sort of behavior quite frequently. In my opinion, it gets her respect and jealousy from the others in the female collective or ""hivemind"". This phenomena seems to be quite ubiquitous these days, given the emasculating soy boy producing society we live in."
928,BadDad01234,"Thanks! And yeah getting financially stable will be my #1 priority. Will be tough and my family is out of state as are my friends. So basically I'm hitting the reset button on my life which I think i need. So definitely not going to be in the dating scene and MGTOW helped me in that regard. I'd like the company of a lady every now and then but right now I just have to focus on me and my child and no one else. When the time comes I'll be more financially secure, in better shape and will have options. And will never remarry. Life will be good it just will be a tough road but I'm looking forward to it!"
929,BadDad01234,"I made a couple posts you can read. A lot of it is on me. I was in a dark place for awhile and didn't know it really. Caused chaos (affair with a co-worker, how cliche) But I've been in therapy, stopped drinking and have been doing the best I have ever been physically and mentally. And despite my username an excellent father as well haha. We've been talking divorce because despite doing well I just haven't had the ""passion"" she craves. Kinda hard to be passionate when she won't even touch me.  But I do speak her love language which is gift giving and words of affirmation. It just hasn't been doing anything. I told her maybe talking divorce would ignore that spark in me to want that from happening. How could I fear losing her and divorce if we didn't go through with it? And it did. Started researching and man...fuck I just don't want to do it lol. I know id be settling and that's a bitch thing to do but I just want to be absolutely sure for the sake of our child.

Well come to find out she's been cheating on me. Just found out last week actually. I don't know all the nittty gritty details and honestly I just don't care or need to know..I know all I need to know which is to get the fuck out while I can. 2 wrongs don't make a right and we both have contributed to making a shitty situation

So yeah...I just have zero fucks to give right now. We're going through with divorce and keeping it amicable. We're going mediation route, no lawyers. We make the same amount and want to split everything evenly which I'm cool with.

I'm just a bit scared in how I'll survive on just my income. Family is a state away. Ill be ok just may have to do some side gigs or get a 2nd job and figure out if renting an apartment or owning a condo/townhome would be best for me. A lot to think over.

But red pill philosophy has helped me so much. I've learned a lot about myself, my wife and life in general. I'm a MUCH better person than I used to be and will continue to be so for the sake of my daughter who is my world now"
930,iluvfrostidflaks,"having dealt with one who literally left me for not putting up with bs, i was under the impression that a push over is what these cunts want. but oh well. i think anyone who feels the need to test someone is a piece of crap and not worth any effort."
931,principledbeast1,"Boundary pushing is also a shit test, though less obvious. This is how men end up saying "" I have to check if it's okay with my wife""."
932,iluvfrostidflaks,this is what i was thinking. i disagree with the prevailing attitude that almost all of them want a guy they see as strong. i think what they are looking for is that docile and thirsty chump who will worship them no matter what they do.
933,Heisenbergeffect,"Here's some things that helped me early on.   


Set up a home, make it your way and start living in it like YOU want to. But, my one big advice is this. Keep it clean. There is nothing that can bring your spirits down like a messy home, and once it gets really messy, the task of cleaning it seems bigger and bigger. It took a long time before I managed to pull myself together and start doing this right. But it made a huge difference in how i felt about myself. As well as being able to open the front door and not be embarrassed. I was in a long slump and my house was a total mess.   


Don't live to impress, get only the home you need. There's only 5 people in the world that actually care about your home, the rest are either ok with whatever you have or jealous. And you don't need jealousy in your life.   


Wealth protection before generation. Pay off your debts, even if it sucks. Don't start to try and invest etc until you have your debt situation well under control. ESPECIALLY high interest debt. a 19% credit card is a much better investment to pay off than the stock market. And once you start owning things that other people have payments on, you'll see how much money that actually is. I couldn't believe how much money I was able to save once I had no more payments. Even though I understood it theoretically, the feeling once you see the numbers start adding up in your accounts is pretty powerful.   


And above all else. One day at a time, nothing happens immediately."
934,ValhallaBoundBoy,You're getting full / majority custody?
935,MementoMordor,"They can't help it. It's in their DNA to test potential partners, they are not bad people. Just be aware.
In your case, she probably saw you as a provider of some sort. They have different rules for this and the ones they really want. 
Maybe you are soft or you got played by her or yourself. Learn, accept, adapt! (sounded like a self help book there :))"
936,Uniqueinsult,"Well this is how the story goes these days man. I woke up at 17 after dating a crazy young woman, tested the waters of a relationship again at 18. Conclusion: weird world we are living in."
937,BadDad01234,"This is all amazing advice thanks! Especially keeping my place clean. Our house as it is is a nightmare half the time and constantly smells. My STBXW just doesn't clean. At all. So most of the cleaning duties fall on me so I'm already used to it but it will be much easier solo. 

Fortunately I'm debt free. Unbeknownst to me my wife wracked up quite a bit of debt over the past few years. I might have some responsibility with that which sucks but you're right I will get whatever comes my way cleaned up first. I don't know much about investing anyways I do have a 401k going which is good tho"
938,BadDad01234,50/50 which we are both cool with. She needs her mom and dad and we don't want anything less. As shitty as it is to say the week off will be nice to recharge (and make money hopefully) We've been doing it for a bit actually in just handling responsibility and it's honestly made me a better dad. I go hard on the love and attention and focus when I know she relies on me and no one else. I like it. And like that Louis CK bit at the end of the week I can take a bath in vodka and my own filth lol. I can be a killer dad half the time
939,,[deleted]
940,Heisenbergeffect,"Not sure about the facts in your case, but yeah, depending on your state and WHEN she racked up that debt, you're probably going to owe half of it. 

Seen that happen too many times."
941,ValhallaBoundBoy,Ah okay. When I hear 'single parent' i tend to think of the parent having majority / full custody.
942,ValhallaWillCome,">They have different rules for this and the ones they really want.

He's implying that you were not the one she really wanted. It's not a diss, he's merely implying she may have thought you fell under the beta bucks category (aka, the one she wants to settle for) and you not accepting her bs put an end to that. You did the right thing."
943,nostonewhereIlay,"I see your in the States, not sure about your laws but in Canada you are not responsible for your wife or live-in‚Äôs debt unless you specifically signed for joint responsibility. Luckily I was just reading this yesterday at a consumer proposal site. So if you didn‚Äôt sign specifically your in the clear, at least in Canada."
944,BadDad01234,Ah yeah that makes sense. Wrong phrasing lol. Divorce isn't actually too common in my circle I guess. Divorced dad I guess I should say.
945,iluvfrostidflaks,i‚Äôm referring to his ‚Äúmaybe you are soft and got played‚Äù comment. nothing i posted earlier even implies that. thats a passive-aggressive sneak diss from out of nowhere. you gotta be a real bitch and a loser trying to build self esteem to act that way.
946,ValhallaBoundBoy,"Your vernacular is cool with me, pretty sure most people use it the way you do, not the way I do. NGL week on and week off does sound like a nice lifestyle. Perhaps I'll find a lady one day who wants that kind of arrangement."
947,ValhallaWillCome,"Rereading the entire thread, it may have been a diss indeed. Problem is that I can interpret  ‚Äúmaybe you are soft and got played‚Äù two ways. One being a diss and the other being a hint. Not putting up with BS is one, it's how you end the argument that either shows her whether you are ""strong"" or are feigning ""strong"". This is something women will pick up on rather easily, where you may not have. If he meant that, it's a hint. If not, a diss."
948,iluvfrostidflaks,"i see your point. if thats what he meant then i‚Äôll apologize for my other comments, but it really looks more like some random sneaky insult. and the point of what i said earlier is that these sort of tests and other asshole behavior won‚Äôt get women very far with men unless they find one who is willing to put up with it. in my case most of it was unwarranted and i stood up for myself early on after noticing a pattern of totally unwarranted bs. thats when she took off. lol."

Guys. Am I missing something here? This sub states it's for focusing on independant male life, not for focusing on women, and yet here is another shitpost about johnny Depp's girlfriend.

So. Heres what I'm thinking. Since I can remove these posts / lock these posts all day long and they just seem to keep on showing up. I'm thinking every time some OP who isnt an obvious alt account or troll breaks the rules, I lock the post, and then give OP 24 hours to post something about how mgtow is helping their life. With a positive perspective, or take a ban that gives them enough time to think something up. 

I'm serious... this is NOT a carbon copy or refugee camp for men who want to lay claim to being ""mgtow"" and just spending their time bitching and complaining about women. 

THINK about what mgtow is doing for you to make YOU better. Then post that. You can talk about where YOU used to be when you were blue pulled, and you can relate that to where you are now that you are a mgtow. 

That's what this sub is for, and constantly removing posts and saying ""refer to sub rules"" is not being as effective as I'd like in promoting the content this sub was meant to showcase. 

So... comments locked. Timer started. OP will you be a participant of this sub how it was intended for mgtow men? Or not."

Everyone in the thread ignored this part of the story, even when other people were posting links to the news article explaining the circumstances. The comments were disgusting, and not at all about GYOW.

The post in question was about a comment that people on the board make a lot, that 'women have nothing to contribute to a relationship'. Which made me think, What do we have to contribute to a relationship as men? Perhaps money, but what else?

It wasn't concern trolling it was a genuine question that wasn't just about everyone else, but about me as well. What do I really offer in a relationship?  A lot of people freaked out in the comments, kept insisting they have 'love, loyalty,' those vague intangible things a girl would say as well.

But some of them made a really great point: men are a human shield. We are expected to lay down our lives to protect a woman, even if we aren't dating her. If we are just walking down the same alley as a woman and someone comes after her, we are expected to put ourselves between her and the attacker. As for women we actually date, its basically a 'get out of jail free' card for as long as they keep us around"

1029,UnfunnyName22,"Things Are Getting Out Of Hand (repost) (got banned from MGTOW for this statement)

Both MGTOW and feminism are at each other's throats like cats and rats and I'm getting confused about it all. There's so much hate that both sides have lost sight of what the actual point is. 

I thought we were all for equality, but all I see is women giving advice on how to subjugate a man, or men pushing for dystopian misogynistic ideals. At first, I was completely and utterly fooled by the MGTOW movement (being a man, of course) then after going through all the hostility, I see one post about someone climbing a beautiful mountain, achieving satisfaction, and being a better person from the experience. 

When I saw this, and then looked back at all the women slandering comments, I was like Jesus, this guy really knows what MGTOW really is. 

The people in that sub have got it all wrong, sure there IS inequality, but, throwing more fuel in the fire for feminist activists ain't gonna help.

I remember seeing a black man on TED who went to talk to the leader of the KKK himself, (link here -> https://youtu.be/ORp3q1Oaezw) and after so much diplomacy, got him to leave the group. It showed me that if each party respect each other, they'll bond and find trust within each other to work forward towards a common goal.

But with feminism (in it's current state) and MGTOW, it feels like the point is to pull each other apart as much as possible until a breaking point. Sure, there are pretty bad cases out there, but don't you think we should band together for a common purpose to change those laws and make it truly equal?

Both sides, men and women, have lost the point. MGTOW, if they are going their own way, need to cut out the obsession. Feminism and predominately 'feminine' groups such as the female dating advice subreddit, need to stop clearly trying to provoke bitterness between the genders and look for a common ground to start building good relationships with men over.

I'm just sick of it all, you can't trust neither side."
1030,Brandwein,"Banned from MGTOW for not hating women. Also banned from MensLib for beeing MGTOW. Yeesh. Seems like you can't not have radical opinions on reddit to not be banned.

Waiting to be banned from MensRights for being egalitarian one of these days."
1031,Gozie5,"The first sub I was ever banned from. I mentioned that it was being infiltrated by many that do not know the meaning of it. 

I was having a nice discussion with another and our of nowhere the admin banned me. 

Terrible admins."
1032,HohmannTransfer,When r/incels shut down I knew they would leak into a bunch of other subreddits and fuck them up.
1033,Mr_Crick84,"I was banned a while ago for simply saying a grown man had made the choice to be with a single mother and there is nothing wrong with that.

MGTOW was completely overrun with hateful incels and for some reason the mods were supporting them. All of a sudden incel terminology was being used to shame people that often had done nothing wrong.

To me, MGTOW was about internalising the rational male principles and choosing not to go along with it, Not trying to change human nature by shaming and hating on people.

For a group of incels that hated women and simps so much, They sure are sacrificing a lot to increase their SMV and be with them. I should have left a long time ago"
1034,Great_Sandwich,"Wtf..?  Seriously??  Yeah, I just got banned yesterday.  Why?  Couldn't tell you.  I think it could possibly be for referring a guy who laid out a bunch of VERY specific standards for the women he was looking for to a Christian dating site.    

Suddenly... banned. 

The fuck is with those guys, over there..?"

I basically just said that my thoughts vary from ""I'm 100% with you"" to ""sounds bitter, but for understandable reasons."" to ""WTF is wrong with you for glorifying sharia law?"". What should I say? Approximately 5 minutes after I posted this I got the notification that I'm permanently banned. I couldn't even have a look at the reply to my comment because everything went so fast."

There are many people here in the rage stage, and some incels that have moved to a new home, and that's okay, but it's not a place where you get to bitch, ad infinitum. At least it wasn't before at 60k.

Breathe. You're not dead yet."
1044,ValhallaBoundBoy,"Someone had posted the very platitude driven kind of 'it gets better', and I argued against it. So I got banned. This man was saying that people who missed their kids the wives had stolen could solve it just by going shopping at the mall on Christmas. I wasn't even rude. For many men it doesn't get better, particularly if the child died instead of just being taken away."
1045,pmmemonay,"Not banned, just got a wall of text with insults because I mentioned I used to have single moms as booty calls. Surprise, surprise, I got 12 ""MGTOW"" occurrences on his first page of his history. I think it is funny how easily triggered some of these guys are."

1050,MisanthropeArtichoke,"I guess I have to join the club. The comment for which I was apparently banned related to a female astronaut collapsing during a press conference. The assertion made was that the collapse is proof that woman shouldn't be astronauts. 

My reply: ""Eh, I'd be leery of making assumptions. Maybe she's sick. Maybe her blood sugar was too low. There are a lot of explanations for a collapse. Maybe the stress of space travel, lack of gravity and whatnot, acts different on a woman's body. Who knows. 

Just because one female astronaut collapsed doesn't necessarily say anything whatever about female astronauts in general.""

That comment is apparently deserving of a permanent ban from mgtow1. I will update if the mods respond to my DM."

1089,redpl4net,i got banned for telling a tranny that shes not a man
1090,Aladdin70,Just got banned for downvoting a couple of nasty posts against female homeless .. and some other low effort female bashing. it's pretty funny how you can be a member of a group for months and the moment you say something against them you're gone.

1096,Silva_Shadow,"As a subscriber to both, I can say that I don't believe many of the negative posts in here about mgtow, because I've not seen that on there, mgtow is literally calling out has behaviour from women and they don't like it.

R/MGTOW has been infiltrated by feminists and women complaining, this place is next because you Simps create divisions instead of just saying the truth, which is no one was breaking the rules in mgtow, no one was inciting hatred, only support and calling women out in their bad behaviour was what it consisted of. Anyone else saying bad things about mgtow is lost likely lying."
1097,whotfleap,"There was a post that I replied on saying how if you're not on Nofap you're not a real MGTOW. Got banned from the commenting again. I have come to a conclusion that it's either undercover simp maginas or feminist in this subreddit. And I'm standing by my argument that it you're not on Nofap you're really not MGTOW. No fap should be practiced by everybody in MGTOW, but I guess it's okay to jerk off to a chick that you can never touch. I shouldn't be banned for speaking my mind, that's literally what the community is about.

1098,RyansPutter,"Some guy was hawking fleshlights as a way to get over horniness without having to deal with women.  I said that it's possible to have relationships with women without marrying them or engaging in a LTR and called OP an incel because he is.  Not Reddit's ""If you point out sexism against men you are an incel"" definition but the actual definition.  


I'd been lurking there off and on for a while.  But the bullshit's gotten out of hand.  Yeah, there are a lot of shitty women out there, but I'm old enough and experienced enough to recognize red flags and avoid them.  Most of the posters there see fake red flags everywhere.  


Reddit's just an echo chamber.  I remember on an old account I got banned from /r/conservative for calling out anti-Trump conservatives prior to the election.  Then later I got banned from /r/The_Donald for criticizing a couple of Trump's policies.  I got banned from /r/news even though I never posted there.  I got banned from /r/datingoverthirty for going against the grain when there was a ""single moms are so strong"" circlejerk."
1099,FaAlt,"I know /r/mgtow got quarantined, but I really hope they don't flood this sub.  This sub is about living your life single, not about complaining about women.  Although the titles are similar, the theme is very different."

1104,Wokchefjosh,"I haven't been banned, because I don't post there. I read their BS sometimes to understand their perspective though. Basically, they just want to have their bitterness/hatred affirmed by other males who feel the same way. It's one big, depressing circle-jerk. It must be a sad life, to go there and engage because it's the only place you feel validated. Pathetic, really.

Then, there's the female version... How many of these places exist?

Edit: These people just needed a friend to tell them...give it time and it'll happen/you will meet someone. I didn't have sex as early as a lot of people. I remember some athletes at 16 and then through high school everybody acted like they were having sex. I'm glad I never got any STDs or had any kids too early for me to handle. I eventually blossomed. Everyone does...except these losers. I wish I could reach them but they're done listening."

What is it with society wanted to put so many different controls in motion on every level of a man from his dick/circumcision all the way to his psych, to laws of the land marriage/divorce, expectations as far as being provider, protector.

So someone posted a picture of baby yoda saying he was born a mgtow and I explain that there is no such thing only incels are born that way. I explained that Incels love to claim mgtow cause they can‚Äôt get women but the women they do they will become a fierce little male feminist and will turn on mgtow. I know this cause I seen it with my own eyes and for saying this I was ban.  Luckily I used a throwaway account but wow I can‚Äôt believe that mgtow defends incels as if we are all incels if I wanted to be part of a incel community then I would but then again I can‚Äôt cause I‚Äôm not ugly or fat or short so I don‚Äôt fall under any of those categories. The reason why I‚Äôm a mgtow is cause I been with too many women and they are all the same. Incels want to believe they are truly mgtows but are you truly a mgtow if you never even experienced betrayed by a women? Dated one after finding mgtow and realizing that everything said her is true?

Now I didnt care incredibly much about K-pop I'll admit, but what I did care about, and I felt was worth discussing is the stigma behind makeup itself and masculinity, and how just because someone wears makeup to enhance their features and cover imperfections so they'd feel more confident about themselves doesnt make them less manly or a simp or a fag (a word I saw frequently in the comments) because there are plenty of perfectly good (and straight) dudes who rock a face of natural makeup. It was a stupid argument I'll admit, and I regret getting involved in it, however i dont I deserved a ban. Especially since the way I see it, a man going his own way to feel confident about himself in whatever ways he sees fit whether it be regular gym visits or regular sephora visits without worrying about what other think is a fairly MGTOW concept."

1118,Immarrrtal,Got banned for asking about wanting to live life with a kid or two but without a wife. Like wtf MGTOW
1119,RIPOldAccountF,I got banned for saying that telling women that they should have kids asap because their best years for statistically having the best chance at healthy offspring is probably not the best idea. That along with welfare(single moms make up 75% of welfare) are contributing to young single moms which lowers the pool of women men would want to date.

1150,l0nes0mec0wb0y1306,So MGTOW nowadays is about bitching like a feminist but in opposite direction. What a joke.
1151,MGTOWMODSSUCK,this is exactly where I got my username from; calling out racism on the sub and getting banned.
1152,realMisterBryan,"Yeah I got banned for something similar. Someone was insulting the fact that AOC (who I don't even like) is *just a bartender* (which is totally false, she's a congresswoman now) and I said it would be like insulting Trump because he's *just a TV show guy* (which is also false, he's the president now).

Here is the comment:

1153,bhfanatik,"seems like it has become a MAGA sub. Any opinion criticizing Trump is downvoted to the abyss or even banned. They pretend they're going their own way but they fantazise about a conservative society and obssess about ""owning the libs""."
1154,MuleFool42,"Yep. They trigger easily to anything that doesn't conform exactly to their belief system. I don't get it. MGTOW should be for every man to understand as a lifestyle or philosophy to live by if they so choose. Everyone guy will have his own version of MGTOW, it doesn't have to be one-size-fits-all. 

Very limited thinking over there."
1155,Impossible-asset,"Men dont need a safe space. 

That's not what this sub is. 

This sub is for showing yourself and the world how you can succeed and do well and be happy in adverse conditions. 

That you dont need women, or any of the bullshit that femenism sells you. 

That you can live and be perfectly happy with your friends, your wealth, your health, your wisdom and hobbies that you enjoy. 

You dont get banned here for saying ""men only"". And women dont get banned here either just for being here. 

Anyone who comes here, and very simply follows the sub rules, is welcome to talk."

1164,Impossible-asset,"You're right. ""Calling attention to"" something =/= hate. 

Here's the rub. It is *easy* to bitch about something that bothers you. It often takes much more introspection and thought to come up with a solution. 

Here, this sub is aimed as representing the positive sides of mgtow. What is can do *for* a man, vs just complaining about women. 

Now, maybe by tightening things up on the posting guidelines, the sub might shrink. I'm good with that if what does get posted is positive and helps men show their accomplishments, or have meaningful discussions focusing on living a full and satisfying life vs complaining about the ""nature of wahmen"" and such. 

Jokes and memes and posts bitching about women have their place, it's just not this sub, and to allow the posts that focus on women or ""calling then out"", just detracts from the goal of this sub."

First, it means that you care and that you're giving power to the other person. It also isn't good to let hate rule your life because it's unhealthy. 

They absolutely couldn't have that, I suppose. I was banned with no explanation because their a bunch of scared little bitches that can't actually admit to their hate or they'll be quarantined. So they won't say anything,just ban people with no explanation."
1174,Great_Sandwich,Same for everyone here.  Nobody ever gets an explanation from the mods.
1175,Impossible-asset,"I think you're confusing mgtow with mra's.

Mgtow gives zero shits about any of that. It is what it is and we're perfectly content to walk away from it, and the culture that goes with. 

I have no bitterness towards women or feminists. Their bullshit doesnt stop me from getting laid as I please, without having to compromise my own self-interest, and no risk of sexual harassment or divorce rape.

I just go to other places where the cancer of femenism has not spread. 

If you want to change laws and have some sort of ""come together"" moment, you are in the wrong place.

1181,MuleFool42,"That's terrible. I think women should know about MGTOW and understand why it's important for men to be MGTOW. Not because men and women need to hate each other (we don't), men just need to be aware of how society views them and how to mitigate society's negative influence on their lives. 

Instead, the focus is on hate and negativity. It could be so much better but the mods are children that can't see the big picture."

Ultimately, they're giving true MGTOW a bad name."
1234,Impossible-asset,"I disagree with that assessment. 

You're combining two different things.

Men who desire women but cant ""get"" them are involuntary celibate men aka incels or omega males etc. 

Mgtow men are men who *could* (and in the vast majority of cases, have) had women, and were often married, but have been burned by the courts in a divorce or seen how society supports the word of a woman in judgement versus the evidence given by a man. 

Both men may be angry, but incels *stay* angry. 

Men going their own way have decided that they want to simply walk away from the laws, gynocentric society, and drama that marriage and formal relationships bring."

You sound like one of those feminist women complaining.

Because his posts on ""pointing out the misandry"" were removed. He was told why. He was told this is not the sub for that. He wanted to insist that oh yes it was too the sub for that, and went posting more ""misandry"" stuff. He was again told not too, and instead this time told to focus on himself in a post not on women or the system... he again refused.. so .... yeah, the guy caught a *Temporary* ban, and was told he'd be welcomed back to post content that follows the rules and spirit of this sub when he returns. Instead he went to another sub and started yapping about this one. Ok then. 

Glass house my ass .... go over to mgtow1 and post some shit there and see how far that gets you with the mods. 

See if they dont bamhammer you immediately with no explanation or response to a message. 

Maybe go over to r / aww and post pictures of animal abuse because you're trying to ""expose those abusers""... let me know how fast you get banned from there. 

Dont come here, break the rules, ignore warnings, then get pissy when you catch a temporary ban because of it.

1282,TheSilverShade,"True. It just annoys me that mgtow1 is the only safehaven left for men to vent about their past experiences and hypocrisy of women.

Then people call us misogynists and toxic but totally ignores subreddits like FDS, that totally suggest to manipulate and take advantages of men. 

But oh no these aren't toxic, nobody bats an eye. Lol

I think it's a great idea to separate mgtow with mgtow2. What I find unfortunate is that there's a lot of shit talking back and forth between the two when we should empower and encourage each other"

I always feel weird in MGTOW forums because I don‚Äôt actually hate women. I just work hard to avoid typical female bullshit and cut any women out of my life who try to do it.

I've openly said on that sub, many times in the past, that I'm left-wing, even ran for office, am brown and anti-trump. It never was an issue until now.

I didn't even reply to the notification because I knew this would be a battle that's not worth to be fought and I have bigger problems that require my energy. 

Your right. It's time that women learn about the reasons why more and more men are disinterested in marriage, having own kids or just being in a relationship. It doesn't have to be in a way that tells us ""you're all a bunch of disgusting evil shits without morals and the only way you're good for is to wreck a men."" more like ""hey. No need to be mad. It's just that the current laws disadvantages us and we don't want to risk losing our money and even freedom. It's just self defense that, hopefully, sounds logical to you."" just to answer some questions other women might have. 
I understand your reasons why you avoid women in the way you do and I feel really bad for you. If it would be men who could completely destroy me after divorcing I would want to stay away from them as well. 

Let's just hope that government wakes up, changes the laws that allow women to ruin their men if they divorce and starts letting men keep their money and property and treats them equally to women when the question who gets the custody over the kids needs to be answered. Society could be so much better if this change takes place."

This way it's even better from a political standpoint - while they are unable to hold a serious, respectful and sometimes unpleasant conversation with those who they supposedly have problems with, we can, which makes us actually more inclusive and open than places like FDS or TheBluePill for that matter.

I'm not a mod there so I dont know the policies or whatnot, but it's not the moderating path I goto. A lot of subs do it, but that's up to the moderating teams.

I do think that talking shit about women certainly has its place. Consider golf courses or cigar clubs or poker tables. Men need a spot to complain amongst themselves about shit that frustrates them, and for a lot of men, that is women. 

I agree there should be subs that allow for that. There does need to be moderation though because the incel rhetoric can easily grow out of that, and that should be kept in check. A lot of that shit is pretty unhealthy."

Reddit admins are far above mods. If they don't like your sub, they'll find an excuse to quarantine/ban it. See the Trump-friendly sub for example.  They can even go into the database and directly edit comments without any trace. If you want to create a free speech community, reddit is not your best bet, and I have no idea what is. Sites like discord demand your phone number for """"verification"""", and if you happen to live in a country where burner phones are banned _(muh terrorism)_ then it's pretty much self-doxxing."
1446,SubaruOtter,"Eh, have a deeper look man, personally, I feel that if you're going to lump ""all women"" and ""all men"" you're equally creating an environment to foster this craziness, plus a lot of posts descend into ""I hate it when men/women do x"", and the ensuing discussion gets misogynistic or misandrist.

I think any group which has that weird, ""Hell YEAH"" attitude towards your post when you say ""I left someone who I think was bad"" is a bit odd. I support people leaving bad people, but I'm not jubilant about it. That's just me."

It'll surely take time, but some crypto developers [are already working on a solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ErmOxCEc4), which will make the internet decentralized again, among other things. This woman was recommended by Vention1MGTOW as she knows a lot about crypto."

I‚Äôm never returning to the plantation.   We all saw how quickly the subs gaining new subscribers before the desperate shutdown.  No way to stop MGTOW. 

2020 going to be hella fun.  75% of China is shut down due to coronavirus.  2nd largest economy in the world.  Its lot worse than they letting on.

1457,sean_lx,"I think reddit needs to come out with a ‚Äúpublic warning‚Äù on subreddits that let‚Äôs the subreddits users know that it is violating its policy, give it a few strikes before a quarantine takes place. That way maybe more corrective action can take place. Quarantines should be temporary depending on the circumstances as well. 

I understand that many MGTOW people have far right views.. but there are legitimate issues that men face today (as there are with women) that have discouraged them into relationships and so fourth. 

Personally, I see courts bias  (child custody/divorce), state laws bias, a need for mandatory paternity test at a child‚Äôs birth and cultural expectations that reduce men‚Äôs equalities in some areas. These I believe, are legitimate and noteworthy concerns.. I don‚Äôt understand why instead of a actual debate of these issues, that I ought to be labeled an ‚Äúincel‚Äù or some other derogatory name.

Hopefully freedom of thoughts, expression and speech prevail on reddit. And if not, perhaps a non-profit version of reddit can be developed that is self funded through its users that donate to keep it running. (Like Wikipedia)"

1467,Usuqamadiq,"Reddit (and Google) is a state actor of China. They accepted $300 Million to fund the site and regularly suppress content critical of the Chinese Government and actively allow pro-communist and socialist propoganda and posts to flourish. 

https://fortune.com/2019/02/08/reddit-is-blocked-in-china-but-may-land-a-massive-investment-from-tencent/

Their lack of action to outright calls to violence from the Socialists and Communists on reddit and failure to equally enforce the rules/TOS are a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the requirements of 47 U.S.C. ¬ß 230. 

Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco and thus must abide by US laws. It isn't in their Terms of Service or rules that they are acting as a Chinese State Actor, thus they are conducting fraud against US Citizens. 

This censorship of US citizens is a violation of their First Amendment rights and private company or not, they operate a social media company on US soil. In the 2017 US Supreme Court case, 2017 Packingham vs NC, the Court stated that social media companies and cyberspace are the modern public square for discussing and disseminating ideas and this First Amendment protections apply.

Reddit acting as a state actor of China and censoring, banning, shadowbanning, or deleting US Citizens posts or quarantining communities is National Origin Discrimination pursuant to 42 USC ¬ß 2000a. US citizens and Patriot's have a right to free enterprise even on social media and it is a violation of US Federal Law to discriminate based on their National Origin, even Patriotic Americans whose pride and beliefs including gender roles and outright opposition to systematic Misandry prevalent in modern western society you may not share. 

Please copy and share this everywhere. Feel free to improve upon it which better research as I am not a lawyer. Mods should really add it or a version of it to the bot post at the top of every thread.

That said, I don't feel sorry for r/MGTOW. They express too much hate for women and other groups. That is not what MGTOW should be about. It should be for every man because it is beneficial to their overall well-being and long term prospects and happiness.

Seeing the bashing posts only seemed like some people spent too much time on the sub and not on ~manly~ self development. Not on ~going their own way~  No wonder it got quarantined if that's the case

They didn't quote a single post this person made on MGTOW.  So someone can click on the ""join"" button and then search for nefarious things in a search engine, and get a sub banned.  Notice they never explain exactly how a MGTOW moderator is supposed to police what a member searches with a search engine or why that's supposedly a reasonable expectation."

Which by itself isnt necessarily a bad thing as I can understand where incels are coming from - dealing with similar problems when I was younger. But it becomes an echo chamber which can produce some pretty malignant attitudes. 

MGTOW (at least to me) isnt about hating women. It's about being indifferent to them."
1533,Pedang_Katana,How come it doesn't count? I rarely visit that site so I've no idea what's going on behind the scene.
1534,fmanly,"Yeah, I had seen the same thing. It is just quarantined.  Here is the behavior I saw:

1.  The sub disappeared from my list of subscribed subs.
2.  The sub's content disappeared from my front page.

I then navigated to reddit.com/r/MGTOW directly, and got the quarantine warning.  Once I acknowledged it I was brought to the sub.

At that point the MGTOW sub STILL doesn't appear in my list of subscribed subs, but now the articles do show up in my front page feed alongside other subs.

Bottom line is that with quarantine they are trying to get people who aren't actively visiting the sub to forget that it exists, and taking subtle measures to try to decrease the popularity of the sub, without outright banning it.  I suspect they have statistical data that the measures they're taking lower traffic over the long term, otherwise they wouldn't be stopping at what they're doing.  

I believe it also makes it less likely to show up in search results.  The goal is probably so that when guys type in the search bar ""does anybody else think marriage isn't worth it?"" or something similarly general they don't get pointed at MGTOW subs.  If they haven't heard of MGTOW already the goal is that they don't hear about it.

I'm skeptical that this sort of thing will do much in the case of MGTOW.  The trends that are driving men to go their own way are so large that it is going to be almost impossible to stop this without making big changes in how society works.  Half the trends on twitter/etc are practically advertisements for MGTOW..."

It's unfair on the men who lost their MGTOW sub, when the women over there are given free reign to rag on men unchecked. Double standards aren't cool. Unfortunately, I doubt something will ever happen about that sub because they're women and society won't see under their facade. They can do no evil, right?"

1561,jcar99,"this was my main issue with that sub. i had to unsubscribe because after a while it was extremely obvious that a majority of the people on there didn‚Äôt really care about self growth on their own as a single man, but instead hated women for virtually no other reason than because they were women. 

i was so sick of people just being blatantly sexist on their with their old, shitty, boomer facebook memes and everyone in the sub just eating it up. honestly glad it got quarantined"

This is a place to put your money where your mouth is. 

You a mgtow? Ok. Put up or shut up. Post it. What are you doing with your freedom from women and the societal laws that aim to tap your resources and use you as a battery?

You making money? Getting healthy and staying fit? Out for a 3 week hike in the mountains with your dog? Travelling europe maybe? Or just enjoying a peaceful evening of quiet in a home you own (or even built?)?   

A lot of redpill subs provide a space for whinging about what made you angry. This sub is for you to show ""where are you going, now that you're going your own way?""

This sub is for looking forward, not backward."

This is guy is clearly rich but it seems his money is driving him mad. It is almost pavlovian as well as boring and annoying. He seems to be in denial that women want anything else in the world other than money. I can think of a lot of things they want that aren't about money (but probably require it- but hey thats how we are all enslaved if money didn't exist we would be murdering each other ). If you go on there and you don't know who I am talking about you will. Except oh you are banned!

About 2% based on *known* cases. There are certainly many cases so mild that they do not come to the attention of health care. The vast majority of those severely affected and dying are elderly, ill, or otherwise immunocompromised. Last I heard, no one under 15 had died (unlike influenza, which kills many children every year). 

Now, how about you provide your sources for the conspiracy claim that it‚Äôs a bioweapon (note that I don‚Äôt take YouTube or shock jocks as ‚Äòsources,‚Äô and I‚Äôd prefer valid medical sources), and that everyone is going to die and civilization will fall?

1638,fmanly,"Sure.  I think the goal is to put enough suppression in place that the influence will slowly shrink, but not so much that it all scatters away and finds a new place to live.

Think about the torrent wars 20 years ago.  Imagine instead of shutting down napster/etc the RIAA managed to find a way to throttle it so that downloads worked, but were painfully slow.  If they found the right balance then a lot of people would have stuck with it due to the effort required to create something new, and then the painful experience would have helped reduce the number of people pirating content.  Instead they used a sledgehammer and shut everything down, and thus there was a huge void and somebody created a new technology to fill the void. Then because there was no competition, everybody rapidly adopted the new technology.  If there was instead competition between the legacy technology that had a painful experience but an extensive library of content, and a new technology that was better which nobody actually used yet, then that would have fragmented the community and slowed adoption.

I think that is the goal here.  Don't scatter the roaches.  Instead get them to huddle up while the oxygen is slowly removed from the compartment.  Plus you get less outrage because it isn't a complete ban."

I mean that if you get infected, you either defeat the virus or die from it, given enough time. Most of the lamestream media only tracks how many people get infected and how many die on a day, they don't track the infected ones whether they can fight it off or die from it on longer time periods.

It's like marriage and divorce stats. The state gives you how many marriages and divorces happened in X year, and the _crude divorce rate_ is simply calculated from these two numbers. They don't track individual marriages to find out if a spouse died or they got divorced after 45 years."

And yes, this is not a free-speech sub. It does have a narrower view. And the rules are not complex at all. ""Focus on yourself, not women, dont post low effort memes, dont be a nazi, be civil, dont trash talk other subs and put a synopsis on youtube links so we know it's not spam.""  .... that's as mgtow as it gets and if you're one of those ""mgtow means do whatever I want and have no purpose but shit posts and projecting my anger about women"" types, well then nobody is forcing you to be here, are they?

If your idea of ""going your own way"" is complaining about women, then this probably isnt the sub for you.

Except that is far from the only rules as published in your side bar,  if those where they only rules I may not have a huge problem with them.  Personally the rules I find most objectionable and subjective is the ""effort and quality"" rule,  ""civility"" rule, and ""relevance"", all of which are WIDELY subjective

Then there is of course the rule about ""No denigrating other subs for the quality of their content."" which is routinely violated when it some to talking about MGTOW1  and other subreddits you dislike which is amusing given your complaints about how MGTOW1 is moderated, a complaint I disagree with having seen nor had any issues with the moderation there.

>If your idea of ""going your own way"" is complaining about women, then this probably isnt the sub for you. 

While my idea is MGTOW is not complaining about women,  I left my rage phase well over 20 years ago.  I have been MGTOW for longer than MGTOW has been a thing on the internet,  and longer than many on this subreddit have been alive.  

However this subreddit seem to be more about Physical ""success"",  believing that the ""true path to MGTOW"" is body building gym rat shit.  I have no interest in that.  I pursue wealth building, FIRE, intellectual interests,  not dieting and exercise which seems to be focus of this place,  so you are likely correct this is not the subreddit for me

Looking the first 3 pages of post,  I do not see anything I really wish to engage in."

I mention the moderating habits of mgtow1 because it's relevant to this exchange as I'm expounding on the sub reddit rules for you. There are different moderating habits for that sub than there are here. For example, you havent been banned here for questioning the mods. Try that on other red pill subs and see how far that gets you.

I have on MGTOW,  I was not banned. MGTOW and MenRights are the only to men subreddits I post to,  the others do not interest me.  

I challenge mods all the time in Subreddits,  sometimes I am banned most times I am not.  I have challenges mods in MensRights, MGTOW, KIA, KIA2, and several others

I do not fear bans,  reddit to me a time suck,  something to do when I am bored.  I express myself if people want to ban me for that well that is their problem not mind.  Being a closed minded fool generally results in a shitty life. 

>But I'm not changing any of this sub because you disapprove

I am not asking you to,  I was simply pointing out the hypocrisy and bullshit.  I never had any expectation that my words would result in any changes. 

Subreddits like this never really grow beyond  a few thousands members because of the massive limitations on what can be talked about.  That can be a good thing, close knit communities can be good.  Sucks for a movement,  sucks if you are trying to bring actual awareness to what MGTOW is and how it can save men, but...

I browse MGTOW and MenRights in the hope that I can help a man cope with what is happening to him in his life,  this is why I am not put off by the posts in MGTOW1,  I want to help those men move past that rage on to something better.  You want to reject them and isolate them.  Different paths, different goals

>If you dont like them you can move on if you prefer. Nobody forces you to participate here. 

I probably will,  There is not much discussions here that interest me. I like to talk politics,  I like to discuss how the Culture war effects men, how politics effect men,  etc.  This is what I want to discuss,  you ban those discussions so...

Also I have had this account for 2 years, so it about time I nuke it anyway and start over....."

Sorry dog lovers -- I tried getting a dog and it just didn't do it for me.

The reason is that, for the past several years, we've seen nothing but all these stories about how ""science shows"" that men ""need"" sex and female companionship to be ""healthy.""

There are still some who are sticking by that, like the Campaign Against Sex Robots woman.  I've also seen some pushback against that from the femmstappo, specifically the whole complaint about the tendency for men to be ""emotional golddiggers"" on their wives, and that the wives need to be compensated for the ""unpaid emotional labor"" of loving their husbands...or...something...

Which means that more and more people, I think, are going to come around to our point of view.  And if folks like Sprankle won't, the feminists surely will, when they actually think about this ""need for human companionship"" and ""empathy,"" and realize the implications for them."

1732,Robert_is_a_Loser,"Yes absolutely get a life before considering getting a girlfriend. The last thing you want to do is make your girlfriend your ""life"" It's a mistake many guys make (including myself back in the day) 

Just become familiar of female nature to protect youself. If you have a life before dating you have the freedom to ""not take no shit"" when it comes to her because if you leave her you will immediately have more time and money to do what you want to do."
1733,Hawgster,After being betrayed and divorced. Still losing so much financially to it every month. I don't think I care to find a woman ever again. Just look forward to the rare times when I can get my kids. Pretty much what I live for at this point.
1734,GlobalAsshat,"That's really the way to do it. You hear that old cliche that you have to love yourself before you can love someone else. Life goes in a natural progression where important skills are built as you grow up and a lot of people get fucked up in childhood by not having good parents, a good father figure, or a good circle of friends, and that fucks up their personality, so they end up socially awkward, lacking the ability to hold an interesting conversation or make people laugh or in general small talk, and for men this really gives them a big disadvantage with women and life in general if they can't fix it.

Social-proofing is by far the most important skill to have in life. It's one of the essential skills that leads to a stepping stone to bigger things in life. A large majority of men have varying levels of beta in them but the ones who don't grow up socially well adjusted really end up being the ""creeps"" of society. There's also the matter of having no father figure and an overprotective, coddling mother... I've seen examples of what happens to kids with this situation, still living with grandma at age 40.. nice enough guys but never really pushed to be independent in any way. Women can get away with this because men are always chasing and ""saving"" them, but for men this will lead to a feeling of unfulfillment because men are biologically wired to want to achieve greatness."

1741,Traveler11819,"what's the old saying?

You will lose a lot of money chasing women.. but you won't lose women chasing money"
1742,rockstarsheep,"No matter what anyone says, your biology is going to predispose you towards wanting to mate. At a certain age, when your sex hormones kick in, and you have a sex drive, as sure the moon exerts an influence on the tides - you are going to feel a pull towards whatever is your sexual preference. That's just Nature / Life at work. It's an undeniable fact, for most people. 

Unfortunately, this can play havoc with you. And it does; for men and women. As this sub is focused on men and men's issues, we focus on that. In a way, ""MGTOW"" or ""GYOW"" is really a form of transcendency. That is to say, to transcend your natural drives; master them and shape them, so you create a form of life that suits you best. That's really just the beginning though. 

Over time, you change as a man. Your testosterone levels go up, peak, and then come down. Many men, mellow out, with time and age. They are less aggressive or seek to be less dominant over others. And a whole host of other changes.

There's inherently wrong with having different kinds of relationships with people. In fact, you need to relate and work with many different kinds of people over your life time. Men and Women, have been trying to figure each other out for who knows how long. Perhaps since the dawn of time. We form complex relationships with each other; whether it's family, friends or lovers. Some are long term relationships and some are short term. We all make mistakes; every single one of us. It's how we work towards resolving them, which counts more than anything else. Unfortunately we live in a very strange time, where there is a sort meaning vacuum and people are just super confused. A lot of ""traditional"" ideas, have been thrown away, being considered old fashioned, useless and meaningless. However, that can't all be true though. 

* Dignity
* Trust
* Faithfulness
* Honour
* Responsibility
* Integrity

Are these values and virtues, really to be thrown in the trashcan? I don't think so. 

And really, finding someone to really bond with, is incredibly, if not the most difficult thing to achieve. It does seem like a fairytale. I can maybe count three couples, over the course of the last almost half-century, that I consider to have a really good, mutually beneficial relationship. The next segment is okay, to not so great and then there's a vast gulf of just mediocre, to terrible and then awful. But it is indeed possible to find someone decent. How, when and where? Nobody can answer that. 

And my friend, the only thing set in stone is that you are born and that you will die. Everything is up for grabs. Probabilities and possibilities; you just don't know. The likelihood of better results, depends on you and the decisions that you make. You may need to take your time and work hard at yourself and those you allow in to your inner world. You probably will. 

The only ""advice"" I can give is to vet everyone in your inner world. Make sure that they add to your world and you add to theirs. More than likely the emptiness you feel, probably really has nothing to do with women as such, but about the meaning and purpose that you are going to give and find in your life. Seek that out first, and everything else can fit in around that."
1743,starfox863,Good for you
1744,Erwinblackthorn,"Women don't fill the void. They chain us to decrease our options. That's why they are called the old ball and chain.

Think about trying to travel somewhere. First you need permission from your bank, to see if you have the money. Then you need permission from your job, so you don't get fired. Then you need permission from the government to see if you have a visa. Then you need permission from the airline to see if you have a plane that will take you. Then after all that, you need permission from the girl.

She's at the top of the permission pyramid. The one factor that doesn't even involve the actual travel process, and this is the one that has top priority. And if you don't please that one, your trip becomes a miserable mess that you paid for.

That's the kind of stuff that makes us go ""why the hell do I bother adding that extra factor, when it doesn't even please me? What are my options?""

1745,copper_blood,Also make sure your new girlfriend has a life too.
1746,Aszourus,"Saying the point of MGTOW is to not have a girlfriend is thinking with the original r/MGTOW mentality. Not all women are the same just like not all men are pigs. AWALT is a childish concept.
There are still women who submit to their men and are mother and caretaker figures who don't mind life being that way, these women are also hated by feminists. There's even women who actively have been fighting for men's rights before you guys even knew of this whole movement so be a little adult and logical and realize that while the majority of women all think the same there's always an exception to the rule.
Saying stuff like this is just like feminists saying all men cheat and all men are toxic.
MGTOW is putting yourself first, learning to recognize the toxic women and avoid them, doing what you want on your terms. If she wants to be in your life there's sacrifices she should make. And just like people said here, don't settle with anyone in any way that makes them entitled to take your shit from you. Be the best version for yourself that you can be, and don't let any woman stand in your way. If she doesn't like it that way then she can take the highway."

The mainstream media (from Shakespeare to Tinder) is selling you the notion that you need a girlfriend. 

There is no reason that you have to do what they say. What's more, unless you build up yourself and your life and your status first you probably won't even mix with the kind of women that would enhance your life.

And maybe this is a part of our nature that works against us, an evolutionary baggage we're better off casting aside. By definition, only a minority can achieve greatness, because to be great means to be great relative to someone else. The majority of men are going to lose in the arms race of greatness, just like the majority of men will be betas no matter how much lifting and self-improvement they do, because the game is always graded on a curve. Individual men can rise up and down the hierarchy, but only at the expense of other men, as the 80/20 rule remains in place.

For some MGTOW, a STR MAY be a risk worth taking, but NOT to cohabitate or to intermingle finances in any way.

You raise them to be people to get everything they want asking as they beg or cry for it they are going to grow up to be pieces of sh*t who don't know the worth if anything and are used to being spoiled."

Maybe I hang out with simps but it seems like it's very common for the woman to have the last say in most relationships and decide most things."
1778,TheVineyard1996,It's about not having a woman dictate your life. If we want romantic exclusivity and sexual fidelity then that is fine as long as it is on our OWN terms. Understand? We aren't priests nor trying to be James Bond sleeping with every woman we see. It's about going on your own path regardless if society wants us to or not.

1788,rockstarsheep,"Pick something that is relevant to you. That always makes it easier. 

You have touched on a very interesting subject though. In fact this might be something to explore. What is it though? 

There is no *summa summarum*; which means. There is a sum of all sums. A coherent system of hypotheses; whether these are ideas that come to us from the sciences, philosophy or any of the other humanities - that neatly folds things together. At least not in this particular subject. 

It would then appear, that there is no central theme, beyond the very narrow confines of such ideas as - hypergamy^‚Ä¢. 

^‚Ä¢= I call to attention, the notion of hypergamy, because it is one of the bedrock concepts of RP ideology, as it relates to the nature of women; and for two reasons. 

The first is that it might very well be a retrospective projected idea, less than what reality actually is, in itself. Some academic work has begun to actually interrogate this concept, and it would appear, that it may not be completely true in an absolute sense. 

Now, this is not unusual. Often, with knowledge, and the discovery of it, we can at times, mislabel certain phenomena, because we either do not understand it.  Or, out of convenience, impose a definition that is meant to be temporary, but through common use, becomes the standard definition. 

That is to say, it may indeed be incorrect. This poses a problem to someone like Rollo Tomassi, Richard Cooper and a whole slew of others, who have purchased their position of authority on either, misinformation, disinformation, or pure chicanery. They have a vested interest in maintaining and defending their position, because, in one way or another, their relevance and in some cases, their income relies on this. They have a vested interest in their truth, as it pays them to do so. They have an incentive here, which also stretches further in to the lives of those who take their thoughts, opinions and insights as incontrovertible truth. 

As no one has risen to the challenge, or indeed opportunity, to test the hypothesis of hypergamy as such, the idea and those who advocate it, have been safe in their assumptions. However, this is slowly changing. There may be an element of truth to it, however, it may also be, that it has been starkly over emphasised. 

Just recently, Shawn T. Smith; a highly trained and capable psychologist, has very politely, questioned hypergamy. And it with some interest that I watched Rollo squirm, as the headlights of professional rigour and experience, started to question, what really might be a pet theory at best and pure speculation at worst. 

Rollo has the gift of the gab, and can twine a word salad of concepts and ideas, in order to muddy the water. He can, as a fall back, cling to the notion of the stories he has heard from others, and use this as proof. Now, there may be some truth, in the stories of others, but there is such a lack of sophistication in terms of definitions and the collection of data, for the purposes of deriving some sort of truth; that cottage wisdom will do ... for now. 

That is not to victimise or lionise him. We all make judgments of error, and believe in incorrect assessments. Every one of us. It just gets highly amplified when a personal misgiving is transmitted to a broader audience, that then accepts it as unquestionable truth. The concept may require some calibration, however, that may cause the invalidation of some of the key premises. 

We will see if the truth is more important than the individual, in good time. 

Now, the second part is this. 

The nature of men. I have yet to encounter a term, such as hypergamy, when it relates to the *innate nature of men*. I am quite confident that the feminists would clamber to screech out the term; Patriarchy! 

Laughable as that is, it is still a very powerful concept at play in our world. It is at best, a shorthand summary to describe how women have been exploited and victimised for the benefit of men. Now, before I descend in to that pit of hell, I'll stop. And continue as such.

Men **and** Women can behave themselves in less than ideal ways. Both sexes can be destructive, shameless, thoughtless, cruel and otherwise indifferent. On the reverse of this, both sexes can be creative, remorseful, thoughtful, kind and interested. Some men **and** women, can exhibit more or less of the above. And we can further narrow things down. 

Moving on; some men are not particularly fantastic human beings. They can exhibit some of the lesser qualities that they're accused of, but to wholesale clump everyone together, is a massive mistake. This also brings in to question, the measure or measures by which we want to judge men or women. Who is deriving the score card, and how are they keeping score? What are they enumerating and quantifying, for the purposes of judgment. Nobody really seems to know. It is taken as a given. 

There are no easy to grasp values to use, but general concepts of acceptable behaviour. They in themselves can be horrible stereotypes, or indeed, truths. 

So, we seem to lack a critical framework, by which to evaluate and comment on the nature  of men and women. Beyond the tropes of; ""Lift and make bank!"" 

My little conclusion is this. We need to be critical of accepted wisdoms, or apparent truths, and not go with face value agreements of their validity. We need to have proper discussions to explore the ideas that we have been given. To me, that is an essential part of going your own way; responsibility for the evaluation of information, for the purpose of defining a set of values that you can live a good life by. 

A very big problem to overcome, is the demands of immediacy. Now, now, now. Most good things, do not come about in the - *right here and now*. They take time to cultivate. It takes work. It requires some humility, patience and courage. And most of all, it demands honesty. That my good friend, is quite difficult to achieve. And it is a problem that has been with us, for a very long time.

So, there you go! My little thoughts for the day. Thank you for your kindness and I hope that you are keeping and doing well."
1789,Aszourus,"I am talking about also our responsibility, you say media as if it's an entity of its own run by itself. Let me remind you most big media corporations are run by men themselves. So yes we have been digging our own graves for years. The existence of simps should be proof enough that enough men keep catering to women and in turn making then expect that kind of behaviour from everyone. and BTW I'm not the op, I'm not chasing any dragon. I am a happily single man doing my thing. But that doesn't mean I am not reasonable or logical enough to realize that you can not neither man or women 100% all in one group and say ALL of these people are the same. Believing that is plain ignorant, even though j agree there aren't many women who are different."

Even if they knew, there is no guarantees that they will speak against it in public. Because whatever these minority feminazis are doing are beneficial for vast majority of the woman. They might say this is a bad situation in a private conversation, that will definitely make them look like an innocent person. Since we rarely see woman speak up against modern feminism, we have to believe that they are content with all these. When woman were not content, they started feminism."

I call it ""red pill rabies"", where someone expresses hyperbolic anger against women, and others support him, actually validating the person's anger. It isn't healthy. MGTOW is a positive statement for individual ownership. ""MGTOW is freedom"" is so true. That's why I like this sub. Now go, my brother, live your life and don't worry about MGTOW1 anymore!"
1811,Fobilas,"Exactly.  I imagine most people feel very protective of themselves after a horrible breakup.  They become cynical of the opposite sex. It's not displaying strength. They did not adapt as well as others to a common tragedy in life.  In this way, the mgtow1 mentality is a mental health problem. 

I think mgtow1 is legit hate/anger though. It's like how I hated rich kids growing up because some of them were mean to poor kids.  Or how I hate cops because I've seen them haul off good people into cages. I am hurt, and I want to sooth my vulnerability with hate. When I say stuff like, ""Cops are bastards,"" I'm not in denial that I'm expressing anger and hatred. I am NOT being misunderstood. I am making **dehumanizing generalizations** about a large group of people, and people will condemn me for thar behavior deservingly.

Although perhaps I'm tone policing. If someone is right, it's ad hom to say, ""u mad, bro?"""
1812,Doctor_Red_Pill,I think mgtow1 is fine. It‚Äôs a good place to vent. Although I would change the name to ‚ÄúPost-roasties‚Äù because it‚Äôs obvious the people there are still holding on to some baggage from bad relationships.
1813,lonewolfhistory,I think TFM kinda expresses it best. MGTOW is a path or cycle that begins in unadulterated hate and rage. I think many in mgtow1 are just in that part of the cycle. I just wish there was a sub for every state of the path

1816,inconspeakuous,"I try over and over and somehow I keep breaking. what pissed me off most was that I messaged a girl on Tinder and she really led me on, all the way up until I jerked off to one of her pics (I was 30 days clean on nofap). Turns out she's just a camgirl trying to get a new customer.

I felt so empty.

No more girls until I straighten out my own life."
1817,inconspeakuous,"Women get away with all of that because of the halo effect that they hide behind. It's really not 100% their fault if you ask me. It's men's faults for being sex addicts and letting women step all over them. If their man denies them anything, they threaten him with sexual rejection.

I think I read somewhere that 75% of women turn down 90% of men just so they can try to get the 'perfect' man, which is 10% of men. I forget the numbers, but they're ballpark.

Tinder is a perfect example of that. I read on a social experiment that average-looking women get more likes and matches than above-average looking men. I tried it myself and put a stock photo of a decent looking girl on a fake account (just one pic, no bio and no other info) and got over 100 likes in a day then deleted it. I believe I'm a good looking guy (not a 9 or 10/10 by any means) and I have racked up about 30 likes in a month.

And then it's even more heartbreaking when I'm around girls who are always talking about how there are no good men around anymore. It really hurts, and it makes me question myself. I wish I could tell them that, but it would just make me look worse.


And that's what brought me here. I'm not ashamed to say that I'm tired of hurt feelings. I'm just going to go my own way until I figure my life out, and maybe even cross paths with someone who isn't perfect, but at least respects my values (doesn't have to agree) and treats me like a human being.

They'd instead be on subreddits discussibg psychology or ethics or philosophy or current events or lit, just like everyone else that recognizes human flaws as universal and does not scapegoat one group of people.

. I don't need an incel like forum to express mgtow ideas. Dude I'm basically just against marriage, working slave jobs, and question how ofteb both partners actually *really really* want kids. Said right, that can be a topic for polite conversation anywhere!  It's not a conspiracy victimizing me.  It's social commentary. Everyone does it."
1821,fmanly,"> You would think they will understand female biology and learn to live with it.

> Mgtow1 is stuck in this never ending red pill rage.

/r/mgtow is a subreddit, not a person.  It doesn't learn anything.

Its individual contributors do.  They get past their rage, and then generally move on.  They might still participate on the sub, but with less of the rage-memes and so on.

However, every day thousands of new men are born into the world, and trained to be bluepilled.  Eventually many will become redpilled and will enter the rage phase.  Then they join /r/mgtow and many other subs.

There will always be more new MGTOW than experienced ones, because MGTOW is a growing group.  

You might feel like you're speaking into the void when you try to help them, but you're not.  You actually are helping people.  It is just that the people you help are quickly replaced by 100 others who still need your help.  You'll never be done if your goal is to redpill the world.  

Just be at peace with it.  Accept that there will always be a ton of new MGTOW who are raging.  Help those you're willing to help.  Realize you can't help them all, but most will eventually figure it out.

And of course people will judge MGTOW by the vocal ragers.  Who cares..."

You're not going to be all smiles after breakups, a divorce and such of course you're going to see through the lines and such but does that really mean they're anti-woman? 

As I said before :
Calling women on their shit = / = women hating .

Usually what happens with pictures like this is you end up with low-effort comments, and a bunch of ""hur-dur wahmens"" comments start popping up which makes more work for the mod team.

MGTOW has unfortunately always been seemingly dominated by boneheaded right wing Americans with little political education beyond a single fetid corporate news source. They're all for displaying their superior alpha masculinity for having 'moved off the plantation"" but point out out that right wing politics is nothing more than obedience to authoritarian institutions, debt servitude and flag waving group think etc and the hive pile on. They can't handle it.

And now out-and-out fascist sympathizers are welcomed to the fold. I guess that's no surprise given the amount of 'white genocide' retards that lurk there.

Looking at the rules for this sub and noticing one of them explicitly states ""no racist/nazi shit"" suggests it's quite a problem in certain MGTOW circles."
1886,Sideofcaution,"I was banned due to me stating that even though I am gay the problems of modern women is equally reverberating within the morally contradicting cage of modern gay communities (tribalism, ego boosting, hypergamy, increase in stds, etc) but because I am gay my opinion doesn‚Äôt matter in MGTOW."
1887,MetaCognitio,"Not quite r/mgtow but got banned from /r/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen for responding to this post:

> Is having daughters the ultimate cuckoldry?

> I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.

> Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.

> As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically


That post is freaking weird and creepy. My response:


> This is some weird creepy pedo shit. What are you going to do? Have sex with her yourself. As long as she makes you proud and does great in life, who really cares? Yeah she is gonna have sex, as long as she respects herself, who cares? Would it bother you if she waited till marriage too? Or is the thought of your daughter ever having a boyfriend/husband to difficult for you.

> For me, as long as she does not turn out to be a loser, being passed around by a bunch of losers, marries a great guy and does well in life, it is not too much of my business.

> This obsessing over your child's vagina is weird and creepy.

Sounds like the dude wants to ravage his daughter or is bothered about her ever having sex, even if it is her husband. Anyone that talks about his daughter's 'tight pussy' has some serious issues. That post is weird beyond belief."
1888,,"not banned but I realized how toxic and hateful a lot of the dudes there are, people suck, sadly sometimes people you date or marry are shit, and if you decide to focus on yourself I'm all for that

the difference being actually 'going your own way', not posting about how trash women were to you every day and living in an echo chamber

That hating shows that you care, that hating gives power to the other person to use against you. Then I got banned. At least, that's what I think it was for. I am waiting for them to tell me what I did wrong.

1933,thoughtOG83,"What I do not understand is why so many MGTOW's mock women for having cats, when so many MGTOW's post pictures of themselves with dogs.

And hating women is just nonsensical.

One can be wary of them, yes.

But to hate women is to hate life, especially if ostensibly you're a heterosexual.

I wasn't banned, but I could tell that it was very echo chamber- esque.

MGTOW was originally about protecting oneself during a divorce.

They have posts with FGTOW's (fakes going their own way) decrying their own sisters, like they are going to be accused of incest or something.

That shit be weird."

I have been permanently banned from r/MGTOW for no reason and without any explanation. The one place where you could talk like a free man and add value without the fear of someone shutting you down. Or so I thought. The mods have chosen to hide behind their screens and not respond after repeated requests to give a reason. I went back and saw my activity to see what might've triggered the ban although I've not violated a single rule. I might've answered questions meant for ladies in some other subs and interacted with different kinds of people, none of which is a reason to ban. Why I'm so disappointed with this particular ban is that MGTOW is a good forum for men to develop self-respect and develop their personalities independent of their SMV, to rid themselves of societal baggage. This ban has thrown all that to the dogs and made me question if a good part of its members are really cucks who just want to have the feminazi experience because they are deprived of it elsewhere...

I can post any of the links from my comment here if anyone wants.

I PMed them to ask why they had banned me, but I didn't get a response. My personal theory is that whilst the /r/MGTOW mods are likely not particularly homophobic themselves, perhaps they are being 'sponsored' in some way by far-right elements who very much are."

Because the guy with ""mgtow"" flair really gave off extremely strong /r/mgtow vibes and he made ""meme"" remarks entirely unrelated to the topic at hand.

1987,Sepinde,"What is the point of bitching about people not living the way you want to live?  Some people like having relations, some don't, and every spectrum between.  Insulting other men because they don't want to live the same way, isn't going to help them want to leave women behind."
1988,Drayelya,"Still don‚Äôt know why I got banned. Tried contacting the mods again but, well, from what I hear the mods are absolute shit and don‚Äôt even look before they ban. Oh well."
1989,Superdogs5454,Got banned for arguing about a delusional steroid abuser. He said steroids make you live longer and all the side effects were faked and nonexistent. I objected to that and was banned. He was a mod too.
1990,Adernain,"The fuckers had a post saying that women who dont like being generalised, are the ones that generalise men, while every 2nd post generalises all women, like they are all whores who cheat their men, and only care about money. What the fuck. I so want to show the rest of reddit what a shit sub they are."
1991,kittynovalove,I wanted a civil discussion and got banned and borderline insulted and blamed for feminism
1992,teelolws,"Not banned, just annoyed with how they have automod set to delete posts that contain anything from their list of keywords, and they don't seem to bother re-approving posts that turn out to be perfectly fine.

Eg I responded to a thread critcising /r/relationships, and my comment speculated on stuff that would get us banned from that sub, and automod deleted my comment."
1993,IntellegoTheTrue1,A reset is natural after a while. They banned me for a line of sarcasm while they don't ban blatant feminist supporters. What a shame what MGTOW has become after all the love and dedication I gave to that sub. I feel betrayed at best.
1994,The-Deviant-One,"They got me 4 or 5 days ago. Been a member for a long time. Active and in good standing. No clue why I was banned, no response from the admins. Even after sending 5 respectful messages over the course of 5 days asking for clarification about what post was the issue or at least what rule I broke, nothing. Just ghosted."

2010,Karmacowmelon,Banned from MGTOW. Look at my post history for why.
2011,Loban8990,"I got banned randomly yesterday. Messaged the mods twice, and still no answer."
2012,Justlivinhere,I just got banned for making a post on why woman cant support mgtow. Im fairly new to reddit so the terms incel and mgtow are new to me and i was guinenly curious why they wont allow woman. I thought it was a great idea as i wanted to introduce a kid of friends of mine to that sub because he really dont have much hobbys and i hoped that sub could support him in finding his own way. But damn those man are full of hate and full of themselves and not about going their own way.
2013,TigPlaze,I may be banned at mgtow 1.  I make posts there and they never show up.  WTF?  They're totally on topic posts without any flaming of anyone.
2014,,[removed]
2015,dolcesaur,Why did they ban me? All I did was make a simple comment
2016,,[removed]
2017,5fingerdiscounts,Why mgtow banning people?
2018,debanked,"Yes banned. No idea why, whatever

I had got out most of my redpill rage, so I guess they sent me on my way"
2019,,"So wow, I can't believe I just got banned from r/MGTOW. I thought I was one of their brothers. I loved the content that was posted. I didn't see it as hateful at all. I saw it as frustrated and hurt red pilled men who needed to vent. All was well until I notice some of my comments were getting no activity, so I made this post.

>I have been suspicious of any posts or comments I make that have no activity, so I asked one of the members to try to look at any of my posts or comments that stay at 1 karma. More and more recently, my comments are missing and my posts are removed without explanation. When I attempt to contact mods, I get ignored. Mods, if you have a problem with me, talk to me. Don't ignore me. If you are overwhelmed with mod stuff, get more mods to help. It's really irritating to try to participate in a sub when my stuff gets randomly removed for no reason.

When that post was deleted, I pressed the mods for an explanation and I got banned. If they really don't want to deal with people or the stress of moderating a sub, they should step down as mods. Just removing submissions and comments without explanation is an unacceptable way to run a forum regardless of the subject of the forum."
2020,Sepinde,"Got banned for advocating letting men go their own way, even if that way isn't away from women"

It just got me by surprise."
2023,Anthony_Fellowlin,Got banned for questioning an incel
2024,Buckeye44302,Not sure why I got banned.  It was a thread where guys were being keyboard warriors and really ripping on women.  Didn't defend the women so much as tried to get them to see a bit of perspective.  Always thought going your own way meant not caring what women said or did and you just focus on doing things you want to do.
2025,RT-AC66U,Yep
2026,Matiyah,"I just got banned five minutes ago for making a dark joke about a certain female who posted some crap which was posted on the sub.  Apparently, that's considered threatening.  Even though said rule isnt listed on the community page at all but can be found if you attempt to message the mods.  I think they do that for plausible deniability.

While reading their rules the hypocrisy is kind of stunning.  The whole philosophy is about freedom yet enforcing those rules means that people with a different opinion on social issues wont be able to post there.  \*Confused Jackie Chan\*"
2027,Natty-Not-Guilty,got banned for saying getting the snip is beta
2028,themightyJG,i was banned for no apparent reason.

2057,MuleFool42,"It's a terrible sub. I was there because I believe that MGTOW is important for all men, especially young men just starting out. But they require racism, sexism, and overall bigotry. No thanks. This is a much better sub and I hope that the majority of MGTOW migrate to this sub."

Your daughter wants to slut it up and catch a beta on the downward slide.   


Respecto-boy will NEVER get 'her best', emotion/love/lust/pussy/asshole/tits-wise, but McThuggins is gonna blast his gangsta seed up in her cunt raw and call her a slut while he slaps her. Respecto-boy will 'luck out' later when he signs on to her shitshow for a chance at some boring, condom'ed, purely missionary-style bi-monthly access to her haggered out hairy Arby's roast beef bun, overproofed pizza dough ass, and sagging 'tiger striped' dangle-melons...   


You should have taken the lead a LONG, long time ago instead of letting wifey turn your daughters into young cum-guzzling fucktoy mercenaries that bring ruin to our society. She's a fucktoy now, you can't remove the many, many gangsta-ass dicks she's ridden from her soul, and she's eternally pairbound to some random piece of shit thug life asshole.

There are always two sides of every coin:


One side is the MGTOW sub reddit that have been infested with cuck mods who will ban you for anything that's not against the rules cuz of feefees.


And the other side is this sub that want to ignore female nature and hypergamy by overloading the sub with other subjects....as if they you to forget the main catalyst for why men went MGTOW in the first place.

I'm actually doing really well which is why I started posting my personal photography there. Along with snippets of little successes I'm having in my life.

2116,MuleFool42,"Which is fine with me. r/MGTOW is a place for children who are in a suspended stage of development. Screw that. 

MGTOW is so much more. The rejection of hate should be part of it, as well as the intense focus on self around personal, professional, physical, financial, mental, emotional, and spiritual goals. 

It really should not be a hate group, which is what r/MGTOW is intent on being.

Even once?"
2125,donkeynique,"And then to come in here and see people saying the problem with the sub is clearly feminist infiltration or that the mods are cucks... Nah man. If that is a MGTOW's best guess on why the sub is toxic, the sub is just toxic MGTOW. No infiltration needed."
2126,n00bRECON_BR,"I can agree with that there are many FGTOW, but the mocking over woman with cats is just a stereotype kind of joke (i guess), it means that woman with cats are so desesperated for atention cuz they cant get laid (or something like that) so they use that stereotype to use as an argument. MGTOW posts pictures of them with dogs cuz it is popular belif that dogs are the most loyal living creature to a man. Than they also use that as an argument to prove that dogs are more loyal than the average modern woman. I hope I helped you."

2161,FlintAustin,"I been banned like 5 times.

I had created a few accounts down the road to keep my daily red pills since I don't use Reddit for much else.

However, this time around I am pretty sure being in a mgtow sub where you feel like walking on eggshells like a relationship with a woman is last thing I want.

Fuck them."
2162,FlintAustin,"Yup you are not alone man. As you clearly see here lol.

There has been something fishy since last year. I was shadow banned for about 2 weeks. Then I was banned for 'low effort' post and unbanned once I wrote them about 5-6 times.

Again banned again lol.

I think they are too concerned about not being perceived a certain way.

Basically bashing females is encouraged and seems to be a hard lean on male-victim narrative. More like a systematic way to impress young minds but censor experienced men who see the grey than just black and white."

2166,Solid_Gold_Turd,Unbanned? Does such a thing even happen over there?
2167,Impossible-asset,"Correct, because people havent stopped being banned from there without any reason. And they still post here in the main forum, which then gets clogged with posts on the subject. So that's why there is another thread."

2198,MetaCognitio,I was the one that got banned for calling him out!
2199,MelodicBrush,"That's my point. Exactly the same happened to me. I only said that my gf seems to be an exception. Boom ban. They want to make the sub into a hate sub an nothing else, so that they can discredit MGTOW as just being men that want all women dead or something."
2200,GoatKnows,"Well I will say this when there is over a 90% chance you will interact with a womanbin some form and you demand that there is 100% no reason to talk about it as though it doesn't exist you are setting men up to fail. Because your mail, your Uber driver, your public transportation ride, & much more will include women. And all it takes is one slip up to arm her with the key to destroying you"
2201,the_milk_is_back,"I get that. But to be MGTOW is to acknowledge certain things regarding society and women. But to dwell on it is simply NOT going one's own way. And to be so rigid in judging people is just a miserable way to live life.

In my experience the padawans like posts such as ""look at this post-wall thot looking for a simp orbiter beta provider"".

The masters like ""I'm learning to truly enjoy life being single and here's this car I'm restoring"" or ""me and my friend on the lake at sunrise going fishing""

The rage stage is real, but life is so much better when you leave it behind."
2202,haagendaas,Yeah one of those guys called me a ‚Äúfake MGTOW‚Äù all because I ‚Äúonly‚Äù refused to do hookups and came into relationships cautiously because I knew the dangers
2203,GoatKnows,"My brother to me I understand if it's hate speach their will be threats of violence but the truth is MGTOW & GYOW is about avoiding women & staying in your goal. And to avoid reminding men about a danger that is in their instinct to come help that's only a trap. For example a woman & her kids are stuck on the road, & a man helps without knowing that he set himself up for the woman to lie that he tried to rape her in front of her kids, just so she can get attention. MGTOW needs to keep that fear of contact with the modern American women who for attention will not only weaponize herself but her bastard children. We men already know how to deal with one another it's that danger of wanting to be honorable & helpful that women prey on & it's something we have to fight against every moment. Oh a women can't lift her package tried to help accused of stealing, oh a woman bumped into a you she fell you tried to help claims you touched her inappropriately. 

Yes by being MGTOW & GYOW we declared victory & freedom, but our guard must stay up as all times not against women but our own nature that will lead us to helping them."
2204,passsingstrange,They are angreerrry
2205,kayfab,"Yeah this is kind of weird, this is why i never follow religion nor politics."
2206,AlanTheGr8,People should be free to pro anti trump everywhere and not banbed for it unless its trolling etc. Free speach isbunkown to most of reddit and trp is quarantined but incest and dogsex subs r not..insanity
2207,kayfab,completely stupid ban and unbanned what ever happen to freedom of speech now there are a zillion rules to follow or you get banned before posting.....
2208,kayfab,Sorry to offend you fatty
2209,Svartanatten,It's all socialism?
2210,AlanTheGr8,"I swear that MensRights and MGTOW are stealth channels that is  are psyops. There are lots of silly mods there,  that may or not be women, and the goal may be to give the appearance of free speach while shadow banning all posts that hit close to home or are too dangerous and truthful.

&#x200B;

It would be too obvious to outright ban ALL male speach so it gives them plausable deniablility and cover.

&#x200B;

Also many of the mods may be easily triggered, have a bad life, general mean trolls, etc.

&#x200B;

I think a lot of reddit, like IRC, and early internet, people camped out or bought names of channels/domains so that they could control them.

&#x200B;

For instance it wouldn't surprise me at all if a Woman  were to start a channel called MGTOW to monitor and control all thought that goes through there.

&#x200B;

Heck, men could run some feminist channels. Wouldn't that be funny. Laff"

2213,tegs98,Yeah
2214,DiccDucc,"Right. I commented on a post in where a couple were both acting like children, and was neither on the man's side, or the woman's side. I wrote about how both of them were immature, and how neither should be in a relationship before they mature a little bit more.   


Then I got called an anti-male cuck (for calling both people in the couple assholes) and banned. 

&#x200B;

Yikes."
2215,gielrebel,didn't catch your drift here mate.
2216,veronikuh,That‚Äôs exactly what I said! It is the same goal! Feminism allowed me to define myself apart from my relationship to men. And MGTOW allows men to define themselves apart from their relationship to women. I think it‚Äôs awesome for everyone to do that. And I‚Äôm glad this group aims to do that without conflating it with viewing women as the enemy. Cheers. Solidarity brothers.
2217,Ferg_NZ,">How they determine that someone is a concern troll is beyond me

I agree.  I think ""concern trolling"" is a bullshit way of deflecting from an issue.  Concern trolling doesn't exist outside of reddit."
2218,Factor13th,Seems like they most have lol Mgtow doesnt need a leader they all gotta learn to stand on their own two feet and learn to fight.. No point in bitching if they wont do anything about it.
2219,Factor13th,"To be honest I wouldnt give a shit. I am always honest and wont be shut up whether people, ban, kick, beat me up, or kill me. No point in complaining and not doing anything.

While feminist and betas kep destroying our lives in society."
2220,Factor13th,I got banned for making points on why it's a movement and for disrespecting someone who was acting stupid with me lol
2221,AlanTheGr8,Not all
2222,pwandapop,How? They banned me for saying something they didn‚Äôt like and I think that‚Äôs toxic and shouldn‚Äôt be encouraged.
2223,pwandapop,I got banned for saying you shouldn‚Äôt say all women are sick fucks
2224,krugerand9,i suspect a feminist has covertly broken into the mods club over there.
2225,IntellegoTheTrue1,He must be the same incel he swore to kick off r/MGTOW. Ugh
2226,The-Deviant-One,"Same. Been active and in good standing for a very long time. Banned, no warning, no response."

It boggles the mind."
2229,Untowardopinions,Jfc the persecution complex.  Literally ALL OF REDDIT is men talking to men about their hobbies.  You just also want to drop in ‚Äúand women fucking suck‚Äù somewhere you won‚Äôt get called an incel for it.
2230,cmdralpha,That exactly what happened to me just unsubscribe cause there is no point anymore
2231,double-happiness,"Well, what's your explanation then? Why are they being so censorious when that's so much against MGTOW philosophy?"
2232,AlanTheGr8,"Why? What is the preffered word for homosexual these days? Ppl get so butthurt and keep changing the preferred words... Unless the intent is bad the word isnt bad. Black, colored, gay, whatever.

They hate themselves so they ban u. Same with that story of woman who bans if u say female.

Its a crazy world of everyonevis king of their microbubble. Oh king! Ban! Im a queen! Ban! Dont assume my gender! They are just looking to make others miserable.

And it spills into the real world... It was busy at the gas station pumps and i waited and i finally started pulling into one and someone else who had just got their literally went ape shit and cursing me late 40s asshat acting like 5yr old.

So Im like u want 2 fight bro? And hea like yeah get out of ur car! So I start 2 video him and he fled... What a mighty wuss crybaby. 

The mods are like him x10 -20, years"
2233,BeckyLynchIsBetter,"I think it's stupid, but okay. Thanks for letting me know, btw."

 Isnt that obvious to you? 

Guess not because you have a woman's brain."
2238,,"Seriously, it's almost like they are trying to give the movement a bad name and get it banned from Reddit. I can't say I blame the rest of the world for assuming we're just a bunch of bitter incels when the men who are supposedly ""going their own way"" literally just obsessively talk about women and nothing else."
2239,IntellegoTheTrue1,"Learning how to deal with people the best way possible is not niceism or blue pilled attitude, it's just a tool to save yourself from mental stress and useless conflict. Lately I learned the value of it, I think it should be a staple of MGTOW to learn how to deal with people. Monk mode is just toxic and bad for self improvement, even if you have s job that doesn't require interaction much"
2240,DangZagnut,"I can't, /u/Impossible-asset banned me.  You don't see me posting do you?

It still doesn't answer the question why there isn't a ""banned from MGTOW2 mega thread""."

2242,DespawnMe,Lol okie dokie
2243,Drayelya,"That is not the point of the ideology of MGTOW. MGTOW advocates for men deciding what way they want to go, even if that way isn‚Äôt in line with how other MGTOW think. The point is to offer/receive advice but, not to force your own personal idea of what MGTOW is down another man‚Äôs throat. This is why a lot of the monks have left the main MGTOW sub or even got banned for ridiculing how it‚Äôs members act."
2244,wathon2,"this.   Freedom of speech for me but not for thee. 

Sounds familiar,  sounds like feminism.   No wonder people equate MGTOW to feminism.  

The MODS over at MGTOW (if they are reading this comment) need to get their heads out of their asses and take a long look in the mirror."
2245,nla6219,"Im far from liberal, i oppose almost everything modern day liberals/leftists stand for. That being said and even being a Theocratic Distributist personally I believe in free speech for all whether i agree with you or not. The only laws that are legit are the original amendments in the U.S. constitution. Everything else has no validity. Any laws or policies that say you have no right to speech, privacy or armaments are unconstitutional, invalid and must be fought against.

I'm not sure if you watch TFM by chance, but he's addressed the topic before. Going your way isn't just about relationships, but a path to self actualization without the need for external validation. Gay men and bi men absolutely can be MGTOW."

2251,poopiedoodie710,Closest I‚Äôve found to any sort of positive space for men has been r/menslib. Admittedly I‚Äôm kinda leery about this sub but I‚Äôll give it a chance; r/MGTOW has some warped individuals on there lol
2252,MuleFool42,"Exactly. Men need to share stories, collaborate, and support each other. That's what it should be, instead it's a cesspool over there. This is a much better sub."
2253,GTOH4U,"Yep, that's where it's going. Just an incel woman hating jerk circle rather that a positive group where people discussed what path they were taking and how to do it etc."
2254,,"this exactly. 

Westerners have been so brainwashed by the 6 million lie it is utterly ridiculous to have an educated discussion about this.

I have seen the information you are talking about and the 6 million figure was lauded by jewish press going back into the 1800s for a number of events."
2255,DyingSociety,I like to think that most individuals are sane in mgtow but this screams mental health issues. Maybe I shouldn't associate myself with these people considering what the mod did...

2257,simplisticallysimple,"No doubt, but we all already know that. Like I said, there's a time and place for everything. And I hope this place wouldn't become a place for that. Men seem to have trouble discussing women ""dispassionately"" because most have been burned bad and can't shake off that bitterness. In the end, it devolves into women-bashing all over again, like r/MGTOW."

2262,alamsohel1990,true way to go
2263,cursed_deity,i don't think so because the first time got banned was because i gave the tip to not hate women but to simply ignore them and focus on bettering yourself
2264,IntellegoTheTrue1,Yeah that sounds like a reasonable thing
2265,cursed_deity,"come on, lets not use incel as an insult.

Some faggot admin found his way in but left his balls behind."
2268,FlintAustin,"The whole point for mgtow is men doing their thing and speaking their mind.

Some men will always have some reservations toward liking or disliking women that swings on extreme ends. But they have a very narrow approach.

Kind of good to be banned. Was being too pessimistic."
2269,Loban8990,I already have. Ive been a member of that sub from my other account since 2014 and a year on this one. Ive always followed thier rules so it is annoying to just be kicked out with no explanation. But whatever I unsubbed from there with both accounts.
2270,,Cause you sound like a dumb liberal fag to the mods in your comment thats explanation enough
2271,unblackmailable,"Maybe it's more simple than that.  Let me kick in an open door.  I don't think they ban you because they hate themselves, I think they ban just because they can.  What I believe at this point is, that one must present themselves as more than virtuous or you get cannibalised by your own kind, e.g. not red enough for a communist, not green enough for an environmentalist ... it's all very political in a sense that politics have become the new religion.  The Spanish inquisition didn't only burn demons, they got innocent people to."
2272,vHohenheim23,"It is stupid. You should be allowed to say whatever you want, exactly because it is a public domain. It's called freedom of speech/expression etc. 

So I guess the main question should be. Is reddit a platform(does not censor as they won't be forced to take responsibility for content made on their platform) or a publisher(a bunch of illiterates that censor opposition)...? Which one is it? 

It's even more disconcerting when the interpretation of ""racism/nazism"", ""women-hating"" etc gets left to a  bunch of overly sensitive man-children. 

What offends them, might not offend you or me. What they deem ""hatred"" might not be hatred at all. They just don't like the message, so they delete it and ban the user to silence any opposing opinions. 

Are homosexuals equal to the rest of us, or are they a protected class to the point where you'll get banned just for calling someone gay? Because that is what the latter looks like, that's then not ""equality"" like they bark the whole day, it's enforcing a ""protected class"". That's something entirely different, but that is the type of nonsense you get left with when a bunch of fruitcakes get to decide the ""rules"" everyone should ""abide"" at instead of leaving everyone to discuss issues, regardless of how ""offensive"" it is; like any supposed-to-be civilized nation."
2273,unblackmailable,"you're right.  I was thinking about a sword of Damocles that hangs over one's head when saying something slighty off, when I wrote it.  It came across totally differently.  But calling it stupid might not be correct either.  If it's stupid but it prevents a negative result...it's just ignorance."
2274,kittynovalove,You‚Äôre proving my point
2275,FlintAustin,"Monk mode is toxic? Not sure what interaction with others plays a factor here.

What is toxic is this notion of self-improvement masquerading some serious underlying desire to feel validated from others.

A monk has achieved far greater self-improvement living amidst the constant chaos."

2279,Azuzu88,"For a while I noticed quite a few guys speaking up about how the self-improvement posts had died out and all of the posts were about hating women, but they eventually dried up."
2280,MetaCognitio,"I stay on the fringes to be honest. I listen to what some of the youtubers and posters have to say, but the deeper parts of the MGTOW community have some really screwed up people (and some that aren't obviously). Some of these guys literally HATE women.

The fact that I got banned, the post has 34 upvotes and the guy has a daughter really bothers me. At least some of the replies are better. Although one spoke about that being the reason why there are selective abortions in India so they can have male children ü§Æ"

If you show up and start making posts about ""this is gay, that is gay, I might go eat some hay I can make things out of clay, and lay by the bay, I just may, whaddya say?""  Well, then your post would get removed and the mods would tell you at least what rule of the sub you were breaking. 

It you persist at it and constantly become a nuisance, then you should be shadow banned or temporarily banned. But you have to try pretty hard for that to happen here. 

As for freedom ot speech. Well, yes and no. We do want to encourage people to discuss things here, as long as it falls within the direction and purpose of the sub. And that is basically one that mgtow is a healthy life philosophy for men. 

Its not a place just bash on women or complain about access to or lack thereof of sex. It's for men who are walking a mgtow journey and want to talk with others who are doing the same, and offer advice or answer questions for men who would like to and have questions about it.  On topic discussion. 

If we just said ""hey it's a free speech bastion"" we'd end up with a meme-littered negativity fest and before long the sub would get shut down. 

So yes, the sub is moderated to keep the level of discussion elevated, for the benefit of all the subscribers. I hope that helps explain things a bit."
2294,Frelsi_8899,"I agree with everything you said, unfortunately, there's no fixing it. 

And it doesn't stop there. There's a mod on /r/infidelity that bans post just at the sheer mention of pronouns she deems unfit. Eg: Female. Until that sub I had no idea that some people consider the word female an insult. I just use it as a synonym for women. 

Same like I call women, birds, chicks, chicas, for the last few decades no one ever took offense. 

Problem is 1 foul moron, who's actually in charge of a pretty serious sub, which is the first sub people go to looking for information and support for infidelity, a VERY serious subject matter, are at the whim of some feminist with the emotional EQ of a 5-year-old and the mannerisms and maturity of a stubborn 19 year old. 

At no point do these people step back and just let the users of these subs get on with what they want. 

And does their policing really help? Well, no one likes to be policed. But if it hits the point where it's no fun anymore, or simply broken, that's when subs lose traction, and when that happens Reddit loses traction."
2295,IntellegoTheTrue1,If you monk till the point you can't talk and interact with people with some sort of self awareness there is no MGTOW group where you don't risk to be kicked out from. MGTOW is not about solipsism.

Thus as a gentleman and if you are interested it would have been  nice thing to do. In todays society there is alot of femists but keep in mind not everyone is and I dont think should change the way you approach women. Maybe she did back out because she wanted a free meal or maybe she didnt. Women are wired different than us. Maybe she just took it a little offensive. Either way, you shoot your shot with your women if you cant do an inexpensive meal after you were the one that asked her out. Than maybe you should wait till a girl asks you out. I dont mean anything in a bad way. A single meal wont kill you if its a girl that really interests you."

2369,hundakuten,Are you sure you're not looking for a PUA forum?
2370,Blexit2020,">She's just some woman with traditional values...

Exactly. I keep trying to tell some of y'all that you're gonna mess around and shoot yourselves in the foot because you're pushing away good women with Conservative, traditional values; likely women who have some kind of religious upbringing. Generally, not all, but *generally,* these types of women are anti-feminist and embrace their roles as women which is to be a help -meet to their husbands. I honestly don't know what else to say anymore, because it's not dissimilar from what feminists do to men and then complain about there ""not being any good men left."" Well, it's because all of the ""good men"" you want have traditional values, and your emasculating BS is a complete turn off to them. So, they walk away from or avoid you completely. 

It's the same with MGTOW/red pill men who are still dating for whatever reason. If you try to pull that ""true equality"" mess on a woman with traditional values, she's going to be turned off. That means, you just pushed away a woman that likely believes in submitting to her husband, the man being the head of the household, home cooked meals, washing your drawls, and keeping the marriage bed undefiled and satisfactory, and you being [the king of the castle](https://youtu.be/_e1Hw39C7lE). These women are also usually raised that approaching men is forward and unladylike, so the *only* way you can encounter her is if you do the courting. A woman that is ok with ""going dutch,"" NSA sex, hanging out in bars drinking and carrying on, is likely a feminist! The very type of person a lot of MGTOW men say they're actively trying to avoid. It's like they want a woman with traditional values, but feminist behaviors. It don't work that way, pimpin' lol. You either get a lady with traditional values whom you have to present with equally traditional values or you get a feminist. Those are your options if you choose to date instead of going monk. 

There are a lot of good men and women out there who want to love and connect with someone and start a family. And feminists and MGTOW cats are gonna mess around and push good candidates away because they're trying so hard to ""beat the system"" and prove a point. Once you've gotten to a point where you're actively blocking your own blessings, it is *then* that you've become a slave to the system. I've seen this happen in person. This girl got mad because this guy who was interested in her opened the door for her. This guy's a complete gentleman and a darn good catch. He has very traditional values and will make an excellent husband and father some day. And this heifer had the nerve to get mad because he opened doors for her? She sure didn't get mad when he was paying for her meals and driving up his gas getting her to work every day, though. If I sound irritated, I am, because this is my little brother I'm talking about, and I didn't appreciate the way this girl did him at **all.**

Traditional values don't mix with feminism and MGTOW. So if you want to date and adhere to MGTOW, you're going to be relegated to the feminists you hate, because a woman with traditional values will be put off by you. Period."
2371,Ridewithme38,"Its not so much a game he's playing as he has a type. Just like you may not want to date a fat girl, he does not want to date a girl who doesnt contribute equally."
2372,KhajiitFL,"FYI: PUA != MGTOW

2373,Thotsithinknots,Np yea. You are correct. I've had 10s pay insist on paying their way. You stuck to your guns. Respect. I'm the same way. Draw that hard line.
2374,Amphibole_,"Just because he isn't completely ignorant to the dating scene doesn't mean he's involving himself in it. 

Did you know that some people go MGTOW as a response from learning red pill theory, opposed to just blindly going along without understanding the social dynamics relating to it?"
2375,Amphibole_,"You make a good point, but I think it's too easy to say traditional = good, equality = bad. 

I mean the above is 'probably' true if you want a long term relationship like your brother, but the reverse is true for men who don't want one, and are just interested in the short term right?

And the OP rejected someone for holding traditional values, indicating he just wanted someone for the short term. 

I would argue that short term isn't worth it, especially given the type of people who want equality, as you said. But the same goes for long term. Just because they're traditional, doesn't mean it's a good deal, nor does it mean they're any different from most other women at heart (AWALT). It's up to each individual (who dates) to decide which they want, and if they go for the reverse, what more can they expect than to get hurt.

&#x200B;

I suppose there are also women who take this traditional perspective of wanting to be paid for, and then acting in every way non-conservative. I think that's the reason for the OP to make this thread. He's trying to warn us of women who kinda chameleon traditionalism to exploit mens' wallets?

 

But again, the OP indicated to the woman he wants something short term (equal pay), and she rejected on terms that either (1) she doesn't want short term, or (2) she's chameleoning traditionalism for a free meal.

So, is he warning us of (1) or (2)... well he never found out which one she was, so it's all too likely she's simply traditional. Leaving me to ask, why did he make this thread and why is everyone pretending there is a lesson to be learnt from his story?"
2376,,"Men paying for dates ended when women largely entered the workforce in ww1 and ww2. Now, there is no reason for not go half on dates."
2377,Amphibole_,"When I said he's playing a game, I was referring to him trying to go on dates with women. All that 'nonsense', it is all just part of what women are, and these things repel MGTOW individuals. 

&#x200B;

But if the OP wants to date that's fine and it's on him. He can want a relationship with someone who pays for themself. But it goes both ways. She can also want someone who pays for her. 

The difference is he wants equality, and she doesn't. But if you want a sustainable relationship, equality is irrelevant, as attraction is asymmetrical. Again, it's up to him but just don't complain about what you're choosing to engage in."
2378,Amphibole_,"What did I say that makes you think so, and why? I'm a MGTOW who never dates or anything of the like, nor do I intend to ever in the future.

I'm arguing that the dating scene is asymmetrical for biological reasons, and if people choose to date, this is something that they must accept. Personally, this would be a downside to dating but as a MGTOW, I don't date so idgaf and idk who in this sub would care."
2379,Thotsithinknots,I would even tell her she should be ashamed of herself its 2019!
2380,bunnytron,"Usually when the girl insists on paying for herself, it means she is not interested and has friend-zoned. But I also know of many exceptions where if the man is unemployed/underemployed or they‚Äôre college-aged that going Dutch is common practice"
2381,hundakuten,"Man, you make me cringe so hard"
2382,Blexit2020,"I was being very general when I said good men/women have traditional values. Obviously, people are individuals and should be judged by their character. I wasn't so much stating that people with traditional values are usually ""good people to be in relationships with"" as I was stating that people who are good candidates for relationships usually have traditional values. Does that make sense?

All in all, I, too, am unsure what the exact message OP is trying to convey, here. To draw parallels with feminists again, it's like complaining that there are men out there who have the ""nerve and audacity"" to expect a woman to be more submissive, feminine, and allow him to lead. It just sounds like a typical situation of encountering someone who doesn't share your values and with whom you're incompatible. That's...*normal.* There's nothing wrong with having traditional values, and if one doesn't want to adhere to traditional values, they have every right to look elsewhere. But there's no reason to ring the proverbial alarm and ""warn"" others that people with traditional values exist. Even if the intent was to imply the ""chameleon theory"" it's still unnecessary. That's like saying, ""Beware of ""smiling faces."" Sometimes people are nice to others just to get what they want out of them."" Naw, really, lol?

>Just because they're traditional, doesn't mean it's a good deal, nor does it mean they're any different from most other women at heart (AWALT). 

That's very true. But it is a good temperature gauge, for sure.

Maybe it's because I'm a socially awkward weirdo, but I'll never understand why so many people who claim to be tired of being generalized by certain groups then proceed to generalize others themselves. Literally every demographic does this ad nauseam; *especially* these past few years. I swear, depending on the subject matter, every online discussion involves some variation of the following:

White people always...

Black people always...

Conservatives always...

Liberals always...

Immigrants always...

[Insert religious group here] always...

Men always...

Women always...

Do you ever think that we'll get to a point in society where we start judging people based upon *who* they are instead of *what* they are? The fact that humans are even managing to coexist anymore with this type of thinking being so widespread is nothing short of a miracle. I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop, because it's like everyone is just sick of everyone now, lol."

2386,Amphibole_,"Uh-huh, that's right. 

Both your posts are aggressive with no argumentative value. 

I'd ask why you're even here but looking at the quality of your speech, I'm scared that you'll call me a poo poo head or something..."
2387,Amphibole_,"Honestly, I haven't really noticed much generalising of groups directly. I mean there is a strong media agenda against straight white males in games and movies and all that, but it's a bit specific..

I'm trying to think of what it's most similar to and I just come up with the general dislike of people who are in a different category to yourself, or really just people who have different opinions.

But at the same time, the internet makes it so much easier to avoid it and only speaking to people who hold the same opinions. Take MGTOW for example, even with a heavy social rejection of MGTOW, it's easy to find this sub.

This leads me to the next point, that even within the groups there may be differences in opinion. But a ridiculous proportion of society are ignorant in many ways. They don't look to correct fallacies in their arguments, or find problems with their behaviour to improve. 

What I'm getting to is that most people who dislike people for having different opinions, are also almost always going to confide in their own group, where they will choose to avoid discussions of any disagreements. This provides them with a safe place, so they won't have a strong need to leave their group to attack others (too frequently). For this I don't think there will be any major repercussions on a societal level. 

Having said this, it feels like the topic is too vague for my answer to hold any meaning. but at the same time, I'm thinking that there can't just be a reason for society to crumble, but there must also be a sufficient driving force. Enough people have to respond in a particular way, and I don't see this happening."

2396,mgtowyear4,"Why even explain. Smile, play to their narratives, shake hands, do what you want."
2397,FlourishedCass,I've always held the belief that those who need mgtow will find it organically.
2398,magx01,"Yup, exactly what I do. I usually just say something to the effect of ""I seem to flourish when I am not in a relationship.....I'm wired differently I guess."""
2399,GlobalAsshat,"I come on the internet because I dont want to talk about myself. That's all normal people talk about all day long is each other.  He did this, she did that, I did this, they did that... Basically just a bunch of stories that I generally dont have a lot of interest in I will admit, though in order to develop people skills you do have to fake interest. (No, I'm not that much fun at parties.)
 
 Internet forums are a haven for snarky intellectuals and introverts to gather and discuss ideas.  I get stimulation pondering the deeper issues in life, as opposed to which bar or restaurant I'm going to go to a co-worker with or how such and such a co-worker is so hot or whatever they talk about. Its always about other people.

Dont get me wrong I dont think I'm superior because I'm an ideas person, I just dont care about talking about people all day long. It is fascinating to see the reaction of these people when you bring up something intellectually stimulating. Their eyes glaze over in the same way. Clearly they get their stimulation discussing people.

I guess it stems from not having many friends in childhood. Most people will banter as adults in a similar manner to how they did it as kids. There are so many examples at work with both genders... This is why I say people dont have as much free will as they think they do...observing human behavior and researching psychology.... Its fascinating to watch personalities develop in young kids even from the same parents... You can do things to change yourself but it does seem the level of dominance and submissiveness a person has is part genetic, probably why women instinctually seek out strong men.

Number one reason to get over the red pill rage... You're getting mad at evolution and DNA."

2404,Platinum247365,"I need to remind myself of this from time to time. When I get asked why I'm not dating or don't have a gf, I want to say that I want to improve myself and enjoy my freedom. I don't say ""women do x"" as someone else said, but I tend to rant about how bad marriage is. I need to focus on the positive."
2405,UTRuser74,"Or don‚Äôt explain anything to anyone. IOW, go your own way."
2406,TigPlaze,I don't tell anyone I'm MGTOW.  It's none of their business.
2407,AlanTheGr8,"Although the question comes up from time to time and has some merit, it is also an oxymoron. Why would someone go their own way if there wasn't a reason they were essentially forced/burned/rejected into going their own way? I think it's pretty rare that someone wakes up and just decides to go their own way WITHOUT being forced/burned/screwed into it due to how horrible modern relationships going awry. They may claim that they are doing it ""just because"" but I really doubt that is the case. The real case is men are going their own way because the risks of being with women are too high"
2408,semiamusinglifter,"Maybe this comment doesn‚Äôt exactly fit the scenario of which you‚Äôre speaking about, but whenever I explain my personal stance on marriage, it‚Äôs more about helping the people that have made a difference in my life. I would much rather spend part of my life to improve the last years of my parents and grandparents rather than some stranger who hasn‚Äôt added any value to my life."
2409,Jagabong,"Two rules in my book:  
1. First rule in MGTOW ""club"", don't talk about being MGTOW. It's your life, it's your decisions, and I don't give a shit about anyone else opinions in that matter.

2. If asked about my celibacy, I just tell I haven't found the ""one"" yet(even though I know obviously AWALT), and that's the way it is. I prefer not to talk about the fact I prefer to be alone and improve myself and strive for self-betterment. I think I would then considered either a bit weird or a douche(choosing that lifestyle over family life). And if someone tries to hook me up with a girl, I would just tell that she's either not my type or something like ""I don't want to see a girl this moment, it's complicated, no thanks"" in an awkward or an introverted way.

I just want to emphasize about the second point that virtually, if someone(a male) asks me about my celibacy(and not a family member in a dinner table or that manner), it's probably because that person wants to boast about his family/about his girlfriend/about his fuck-count. Obviously, because truly, he actually feels bad about it or just craving for attention to validate his pathetic ego and not-meaningful life."
2410,gopher_glitz,Know plenty of guys that are mgtow but they've never heard of mgtow
2411,throwd444444,"Let's be clear, not very many people give a shit. 

Once you realize that you'll know how to answer questions. You'll know what information to volunteer and how much of it. 

It took me far too long to realize that questions like ""How was your weekend?"" are best answered with one or two words ""Great actually!"" Most likely Bob or Mary from the office really do not give a fine fuck about how exactly you spent your weekend. 

Same applies for your lifestyle choices. Remember they don't really give a fuck, but everything you say can and will be used against you. So less is more. And not answering is fine too. 

You are not obliged to answer every question, likewise, you don't have to explain yourself. Since most people don't give a fuck anyways, they're easy to get off your back with one-word replies, most of the times. Even an ironic look works from time to time."

2415,SullenBol,Absolutely. I think that's where guys go wrong with that situation.
2416,SullenBol,I see your point.

And to add. I think that's why it brings misery (as per your last sentence). Precisely because it ruins our blue-pill plans/goals. Yet almost all of us just get bored of being angry and go back to optimizing life for enjoyment, even if our past desires are no longer in need of fulfillment"

People really don't know what they want or don't want...they just want what happens to be different from the status quo at any given time (grass is always greener syndrome, getting bored with the familiar), because they create these fantasy realities they think will be better than the way things are, but they end up not being.  I try to remember that when I get annoyed at how nanny state governments seem to be or I'm stuck at stoplights or in slow traffic."
2423,SullenBol,lol
2424,SullenBol,"It's easy to talk about marriage if you're asked specifically about it and not just relationships. But as you say, it's good to focus on the positive."
2425,SullenBol,wise.
2426,SullenBol,"Yeah, i have a friend who always thinks i'm single because women did something to me. But even if one of them did, i don't really remember it. Before i learned about MGTOW, i just used to think that guys who avoided women because they were burned before were really cowards and it was pathetic. But that was just my blue pill brain rationale. Today, with the red pill knowledge, i don't judge. But at the same time, i never really looked at the risks and benefits of women. I just got used to being single and now i don't see anything wrong with it. It's only an opportunity for me to focus on myself. Ergo, why i don't even mention women when explaining my lifestyle."
2427,firewhichblazeth,Lol I think your last paragraph is so true

2454,MajIssuesCaptObvious,"What van did you use, and what about repairs and reliability? How much was it to get the van-home built, in time and dollars? I'm sure it was less than the total cost of having to buy a car plus first month's rent and deposit .

You're doing it right, man. Congrats so much. Your sacrifices have paid off. It sounds so cool, I bet they don't even feel like sacrifices, though, lol.

What do your family and friends think of it all, van life and the home purchase? And the fact that no dating is what made it all possible?"

2456,Impossible-asset,"Sure. I did comptia A+, Network +, Security +, and Server +. 

Working on MCSA now."
2457,Impossible-asset,"It was much, MUCH easier than I thought it would be to pull off. 

I looked at what I had: lots of expenses, chasing each payday, going nowhere.

I sat down and said ""what will I need to DO in order to be able to afford my own home."" The answers were:

1. Get more education to get passed that HR door.

2. Be willing to leave california and GO to where the job is. 

3. Live minimalist for a while to save money. 

Vanlife took care of the minimalism along with not spending as much money getting laid. No rent is a big advantage. 
The education came from ""oh, not at work? Cool, study. Hit the gym, then study.""
Willing to move was ""oh theres that job offer in coal-tar West Virginia or Flat-snows North Dakota? I'm in. 

And it just turns out that being willing to do that got me where I am now, and this house just plopped into my lap. 

You can make it happen bro."
2458,Impossible-asset,"It is. But I built it to be somewhat stealthy. Just another plumber or painter or florists van just sitting in the parking lot or on the street with all the other Van's that sit there overnight. 

I insulated it for the cold, put in an indoor-safe heater to help keep it comfy. I installed solar panels and batteries so I could run my fridge and indoor lights and phone chargers. Put in a clean and grey water tank and a 12v pump so I could have running water, and a propane stove so I could prepare simple meals like eggs or make tea and such. Toilet was a home depot bucket with pipe insulation for a seat. 

All in all, it was pretty comfortable living. I even put in a twin size mattress. 

And while I'm watching a study video for a certification, or lord of the rings, or sleeping, to anyone passing by, it's just another white van.

And I moved it around. One night its walmart supercenter, the next an industrial street, then a hotel parking lot where there are lots of other Vans. If I was feeling really ballsy, I'd just stay in the parking lot at work. Lots of people in and out there so no need to be alarmed. 

It was fun, and I know that I can do it successfully in the future if I need to. But now, it can just be for fun camping someplace."
2459,,What are you talking about?
2460,Impossible-asset,"Sure. But that's everywhere. I dont know of any place that doesnt have property taxes. Some places have higher rates than others. 

On this one, the taxes come out to about $700 or so a year. I dont want to own something that isnt making me money so my plan is to have part of it be an office for my home-based business, have another part pay for itself either with a tenant or with a hobby that can also be profitable. 

I'd rather pay a few hundred in taxes per year than pay the entirety of someone elses mortgage for them in a rental."
2461,Impossible-asset,"I did my build in a dodge ram promaster. 2017 model year so the van was a little pricey, but I know that it will do fine in adverse road conditions. Also it has the front wheel drive so better stability on wet roads. 

They say the annual cost of ownership for that model year is about $500, so I'm good with that. 

It took about three weeks to do the build, with the solar power setup costing the most BY FAR. About 3k, but I have enough power and batteries to last a full week of apocalyptic darkness and a ray of sunshine will charge them to full. 

As for tjme, it was a lot of time, but me and my dad were just having fun doing the build together, with frequent hardware store runs and bbq. 

Family and friends and coworkers thought I was batshit insane, until they saw the finished build. Then the script was flipped and they thought it was a great idea once the ""where do you park and poop?"" Problems were addressed. 

I'll admit on some nights when it was getting down to zero, it would get a little chilly, maybe 58 degrees. But still glad I did it and have the van, now for fun, and necessity if needed."

2465,Impossible-asset,"Thanks. In total the journey from ""dead end job barely squeaking by in a studio apartment in los angeles"" to ""I own my own home and have a career now"" has been less than 24 months."
2466,Impossible-asset,"Oh I plan on travelling to do a lot of sight-seeing. And wherever I go, I wont be paying for any expensive hotels. Saves half the cost of the trip tight there. 

Vanlife has some drawbacks, but it is a lot of fun."

As a middle-aged lifelong feminist, the RPR nearly destroyed me. Having a place to just vent like mad, even if it was kinda a craphole, was extremely beneficial. Sometimes a person really does just need to bitch about things, before they can move on. It supplied that.

The IRS fucks me up the ass every year because I'm not a ""normal person"" doing ""normal things.""  That's okay tho, I do a fair job of paying my taxes, so I don't raise any red flags, but holy shit - I'd rather be fucked in the ass by the IRS every April 15, than for decades by some female who I thought was going to be on my side...

I can even sense it happening with myself from time to time. That protective instinct kicks in, and I'll end up congratulating a female friend for doing something that I wouldn't give a rat's ass about if a male friend did the exact same thing. I wouldn't even be attracted to them in any way or anything; it just happens.

So she's paid to sit in an air conditioned office and *learn* about the problem where I could have written a book about it with under a year experience. There are guys here who've been around for decades. Hell, we have one we pay to travel the world teaching this process!

Not because of some crap like a vegan ""animals are better than humans and sacred or whatever"" perspective at all; if if was about some kind of animal that would be a danger and kill other people if if survives, then the animal would go down without any hesitation.

i could never live with the bad conscience of having a mother with 3 children die to save my dog (who might would not live longer then a couple of years anyway) but as I said, everyone has to know that for themselves

to me a dog is just like a pokemon, its nothing speical that they love you and are loyal, they are breed to act like that, if you feed it and pet it thats enough for them, to me it seems to easy, i dont want to be loved for simply being alive... its like getting all warm and fuzzy because Alexa told you she likes you...at least to me

2645,doublecremeoreo,"I know what I know. I have tried before going without releasing semen from my nuts on a regular basis and it makes me go a little crazy, you know?

2649,betterforitall,No
2650,doublecremeoreo,So what's you situation exactly? You never fap? And what about sex?
2651,Jan22147,"No what ? You can't have both, it's a logical fallacy."
2652,Jan22147,"I haven't fapped in 3 months and I don't intend to go back. Also haven't had sex in close to if not more than 2 years. Can't say I'll never have sex anymore, but I can't imagine it right now although I have a very good female friend now who agrees with me on all points when I talk about female nature and in fact applauds me when I call out other women. 
As far as my situation goes or basically how I think this has helped me.. In the past two years I've dropped all but one addiction (food), I have become financially independent and will soon be earning 5x the average salary in my country (I am a high school dropout), still working a job and will probably take up another one for a few months to become debt free asap so I can save some capital and open up my own business. I'm now training for an ironman and I may even go back to school if I absolutely won't be able to make it without a phd considering it's harder to run a business in my field without one, but not impossible. Since I stopped releasing altogether I have also stopped censoring myself and it has been in this time that I became fully responsible for my actions I've started planning all the time which has had a great affect on my progress, I've taken control over my feelings without meditation or yoga meaning I can observe them and use them as fuel in a controlled manner, even did so a few days ago when 10 guys were threatening to beat me up and I didn't move an inch, which previously would have never happened. It has enabled me to use the energy to train for several hours daily when I have the time, I've worked for 32 hours straight multiple times without getting tired, I can sleep less than 6 hours daily, sometimes not more than 2-3 and function perfectly - something that I wasn't at all able to do before and I am sure there is more to come once injuries heal up and I get to actually create something with money, not just pay off debts."
2653,betterforitall,It's only a logical fallacy the way you stated it.
2654,Jan22147,How then should I have stated it ?

And that's our greatest strength. You can't shut down an idea that's tweaked individually to everyone's taste. 

My own two cents though, MGTOW for me is understanding the difference between men and women and why men need to be above women in terms of responsibility and authority. It's just not in women's biology to do that. "

2676,fmanly,"I don't think it was ever a thing that MGTOW was about being ""without women.""  The typical definition I've heard is that MGTOW is about not marrying or cohabitating with women, because those are the two largest areas of risk for men.  Typically ""MGTOW Monk"" is used to describe the subset of MGTOW who completely avoid romance.  

Granted, with the way things are going, anything other than full monk-mode looks increasingly risky to me.  So, I wouldn't be surprised if MGTOW eventually evolves.  But, then again, perhaps laws/culture will change and cohabitation will become less risky for men and MGTOW would evolve in that direction.

MGTOW always seemed like a pragmatic movement to me, just as most men are pragmatic.  It is about understanding the reality of human nature and our culture, evaluating the risks and benefits, and deciding that the traditional lifestyle of marriage/etc just doesn't deliver benefits commensurate with the risks.  While this realization often leads to rage, it isn't the rage that drives men to make this decision, but more the reverse."

There's not a clear line, which makes my job hard sometimes.  I have to make judgment calls.  There has just been too much of that content lately though.

For whatever reason, they cannot start on the hard work of designing their new lifes hopes and dreams.


I'm just saying, there is a reason for r/mgtow and low effort memes rubbishing female behaviors.

Hopefully, by absolutely denying any relationships with this generation, it will scare and force women to stop being so damn bp. Sometimes taking a hard hit is the best way to get the point across.

Not sure I follow.  Why should anybody have to do anything, as long as they're willing to accept the natural consequences of their actions?  

Marriage was a thing in the past because it was based on mutual self-interest.  Men weren't just giving - they were receiving as well.  And it wasn't just sex that they were receiving - they obtained family ties and the financial support this entailed (in an era where the state did not provide this support).  They obtained a human thermostat, dishwasher, clothes washer, and many other services that were pretty essential for day to day survival while they were out hunting or hammering horseshoes or whatever it is they did to hand money to the wife so that she could make the daily trip to the market to buy meat.  

Nobody had to sell marriage to men back then - the plantation was just the reality of the human struggle to survive.  It isn't feminists who created MGTOW, but just plain old human progress.

If we want men to work harder in the future, we have to actually reward them with a suitable incentive."
2699,car23975,"I agree with you, but if someone doesn‚Äôt fix where society is headed (headed for a cliff) then there won‚Äôt be anywhere to go on your own. You would starve and die or get cooked alive. Climate collapse is coming and someone has to deal with the problem. Bps are too invested in the current system. Every tech advance does everything it can to preserve the status quo. I think there needs to be radical change or we heading off the cliff. I traveled to a monastery for a week, and I saw how they were still dependent on the grid and water. Its a human race threat. 

"
2700,fmanly,"I suspect most of us will be gone long before the human race is at risk.  To the extent that civilized society collapses all the things that made marriage a desirable state of affairs would actually be restored.

I'm not saying I'm looking forward to that or that it is a good thing.  I just don't see any alternatives available right now, and it is unlikely to be something I'll ever have to deal with.

However, I wouldn't rule out the impact of technological advances.  I could see disruptive change coming from two sources:

1.  Modification of human biology and behavioral drives.  I'm not sure what this ought to be changed to in order to reach a new stable situation, but if innate human human behavior is manipulated genetically it could potentially change the direction we're headed in (for good or bad).

2.  AI.  I mean REAL AI, not the latest youtube demonetization algorithm.  AI would concentrate an incredible amount of power in the hands of whoever initially controls it (which might be the AI itself if it isn't well-controlled).  They would potentially be in a position to impose any rules they desired on the rest of humanity, which means that innate human behavior combined with democracy would no longer be in control.  Again, this could result in either good or bad but this also has the potential to change the direction we're headed in.

Otherwise right now our democratic systems ensure that our policies are those which appeal on average to most people, which means that basic human nature is in control.  Even if the odd person is able to overcome that nature they won't have the power to get a majority of voters to do the same, because we've chosen to be governed by mediocrity.  That has its good points, but also its bad ones."
2701,DarthSchadenfreude,"Why does anyone think it matters WHEN the human race perishes? Notice my use of the word WHEN, and not IF.

If climate change doesn't do it, then it will be a beam from a rotating pulsar, or an asteroid, maybe nuclear war, or say humanity survives all that, then the sun dying will get humanity. If we expand beyond the confines of the solar system, the black hole at the center of the galaxy will eat all of humanity. If we expand beyond the galaxy, entropy -- the heat death of the universe will get humanity.

We are all headed off a cliff regardless."

2733,IAmJacksGagReflex,"Right, so this study was published by the Daily Mail, a site that some would consider to be of questionable credibility.  Also, according to the article, it is a ""small study"" (therefore likely not an accurate representation or peer reviewed) and it is a *cross-sectional* study, not a *control group* study.  According to the definitions on the [same site](https://www.nhs.uk/news/health-news-glossary/#crosssectionalstudy);

>***...because this study doesn't look at time trends, it can't establish what causes what.***

All things considered, I'm not convinced.  Allow me to provide another example.  This the title of [this article](https://neurosciencenews.com/neuroscience-pornography-brain-15354/) is ""*Watching pornography rewires the brain to a more juvenile state*"", yet it cites a [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1874574) that I can only assume the author didn't think the readers would bother to read because it undermines, if not outright contradicts her argument.

>...*However, the observed volumetric association with PHs in the striatum*  ***could likewise be a precondition rather than a consequence of frequent  pornography consumption.*** *Individuals with lower striatum volume may need  more external stimulation to experience pleasure and might therefore  experience pornography consumption as more rewarding, which may in turn  lead to higher PHs. Future studies should investigate the effects of  pornography longitudinally or expose na√Øve participants to pornography  and investigate the causal effects over time to provide further evidence  for the proposed mechanism of intense exposure to pornographic stimuli,  resulting in a downregulation of the reward system.*

Which do you find more convincing?  Just because something is frequently discussed, it doesn't make the arguments valid if they aren't supported by proper research by experts.  And no, neuroscience hasn't come up whith an argument that I've been able to find that supports what you're saying that has convinced this layman yet, and I'm open to being convinced.  All I've found is more information that proves your argument ideological, religious and political, but not at all  supported by science."

2752,EthericElder,"Can we delve deeper into what separates MGTOW and misogyny please? I am not being facetious either. One man's MGTOW conversation could be another man or woman's misogyny, so I think if we are going to have this rule, fair enough, but clarifying and identifying where the line is would be helpful. Inevitably, a MGTOW group is going to have to discuss females just as feminists talk about males. At what point does it cease being a discussion and begin being misogynistic (i.e. hate speech)?"
2753,NiceIce,Don't complain about things the sub shouldn't do.  That is the very definition of a concern troll.
2754,Tsukikoselenia,"I disagree quite heavily. First, equating everything to incels is stupid. Second, ""we are not hateful misogynists""... Well, you aren't? If someone is but not in what you'd call an incel way, as long as it doesn't become unbearable as in MGTOW1, he shouldn't have to censor his own opinion. Misogyny or even being triggered over women isn't necessarily opposed to focusing on yourself, and hating something doesn't imply focusing your whole life around it at all. I hate the way some countries are ruled and will talk about it if it becomes the subject, but it doesn't shape my life in absolutely any way.

Moreover, focusing on yourself will always involve a part of reaction on how society works, who gets hurt in the process, and who benefits it, because even if you go your own way you still have to deal with it. Most people have to work and will be affected by gynocentrism, mgtow or not. Which will make people say what they think. Things that will obviously sound quite misogynistic.



Now, the biggest problem, and maybe the only real one that matters: while some things are too misogynistic to the point of being cringy, indeed, how much should be tolerated because ""it's just a joke"" or not is a very subjective thing and depends a lot from a person to another.



While I also frown a lot at things like ""stomach full, balls empty"" saying that it has no place here is stupid. As I said a while ago, that's the problem when your community's goal isn't extremely clear by itself, and mgtow is vague by its very nature and isn't supposed to be some kind of PC group trying to look nice like MRA. It's just free men trying to stay free and doing whatever they want, and saying whatever they want. Some MGTOW will be terribly mysoginistic. Some will not. That's how it is and how the world works. It is bound to happen because yes, some people really think like that, like it or not. Censoring it isn't a good thing as long as it isn't too invading; same deal as the women posting here, in fact. They -ultimately- have no reason to be here, or rather not in the way the sub was created for, but they should be tolerated and accepted as long as it isn't disruptive and doesn't fall into the ""women telling men how things should be and how wrong they are"" side. The same goes for misogyny. Misogyny being here isn't a problem. It's just not supposed to be the main content. ""Thoughtful discussion"" or not.



Sure, this place shouldn't become a place like MGTOW1. I think everyone agree with this. But there's a gap between MGTOW1 that is 95% of hateful posts on the front page constantly and people answering things that you might call misogynistic because they follow the red pill or some other crap (and yes, a lot of the RPT can and WILL be taken as mysogynistic by some if there is more policing. Again, tolerance is a very subjective thing) .

As long as this place doesn't become a cesspool, defining misogyny is pretty much impossible if you don't sum it up to being perfectly PC like in other subs, and that would ruin the point of MGTOW too, since it would mean that no matter if someone is MGTOW, he can't say what he thinks or wants, period."

2761,fmanly,"> Some of it is funny, but it gets boring. 

MGTOW essentially is boring by its nature.  We come together to agree on the things we're giving up.  Beyond that we're going our separate ways.

If I posted about what I do all day I'd bore everybody here to tears, because that is MY way, not everybody else's.  

So, at its heart MGTOW is going to be boring to people who are well on their way.  There isn't some kind of secret to the MGTOW lifestyle.

There are some content creators who create general content that is broadly applicable, but not a great deal of this beyond the red pill rage phase.  

I also participate in /r/financialindependence and the same thing happens there.  There isn't some kind of secret to cutting your expenses and saving money.  Sure, there are some common tips that people starting off benefit from learning, but once you've been doing it for a while there isn't much new under the sun.

This is why MGTOW forums are always going to be dominated by the rage phase.  These are the people for whom all of this is new.  Once they settle down and figure out where they want to go next they'll be gone, replaced by 10 more just entering the rage phase."

Defined:

So for the context of this sub, its ""whining negatively about women, mocking, trolling, promoting violence, or basically any of the dumpster fire shit that mgtow1 has become.""

Like:
The idiot bitching about women not being able to drive
, the guy who is whinging about women and makeup.

This sub is specifically for promoting and inspiring men who are applying mgtow philosophy. Yes, talking about women in context of what they DO to make a guy choose this way (thus serving as an example through firsthand experience of what it can be like) is different from ""yeah women suck, see, heres a post of me saying how much women are terrible"".

‚Äã

And this ""incel hate"" that pretty much means ""everyone not agreeing with me is an incel"" is really getting boring, on both sides. Insulting people of being incels is retarded, but being worried about being seen as such is possibly even worse. If you're worried about the way other people are looking at you, you're doing it wrong, very wrong.

But now its a lot of repetition. Same with the ChooseFI podcast. But its good to read about and listen from time to time to get motivated, or help those who are just discovering this. 

As for MGTOW being boring, I am sure it will be. But it is brand new to me. I just heard this term a month ago when I was watching the red pill documentary, which I came upon because my wife said she wanted a divorce. At first I was really turned off by all the hate, although some of the examples of stupidity were hilarious. 

I don't want hate in my life. As I said, I like individualism and not collectivism. I am totally fine with somebody raging against their Ex, calling her a bitch, cunt, whatever. But I don't see any benefit from hating on all women. 

A good analogy for me at this point in my journey is dogs. I am not a dog person. I understand what they are like, I have owned a dog, but I don't really enjoy them. I don't hate dogs. I'm not going to try to ban dogs. When I go to a friends house and they have a dog, its fine. They are just not a part of my life. I don't go online and talk shit about dogs. 

This is the attitude I am trying to develop towards woman. 

Can't r/mgtow be for the guys that want to hate women and take away their right to vote and mgtow2 be just a bunch of guys talking about the benefits and struggles of finding their own way? I think it would attract a different type of dude that may not resonate with the other subs. "
2780,Tsukikoselenia,"Your first example isn't misogyny though. Comparatively, they do, and it is a real problem because it create a mess when it comes to everyone's standards (possible heightened standards for men towards women, possible lowered standards for women towards themselves), women's self-acceptance, the fact that tricking someone is basically ok and even seen as needed (Korea, you're so funny), and their idea of self-care being screwed over time since it allows to hide quite a few things. It might not be very constructive and people will usually not post tirades regarding  this, yes (I guess I'm kind of an isolated case with my walls of text), but it's not misogyny, and if feminism is fair there is no reason for this not to be. It's mainly a reaction to a societal push that involves men in one way or another. Hence the problem I talked about with ""misogyny"" being subjective in most cases. It can fairly easily turn into impugning motives to someone.


What you refers to as misogyny is often related to another societal problem that is implied, like, I don't know, to take another random example I can think of right now, the wall that is only a problem because society and people deny it and try to force the idea that attractivity is eternal into everyone else's throat, like it or not; people usually don't have a problem with grannies accepting that they are grannies, people have a problem with society trying to rewrite concepts to fit into an agenda so most remarks will be related to it in some way, and society is something we must all endure every day (and if you say that it shouldn't affect you, a man ended up heavily shamed on every single media here because he dared to say that he isn't attracted to ""old"" (as in, post-wall) women. Society IS pervasive even if you go your own way and can very much affect you.).

Sure, make-up might not be the most fascinating subject to talk about there is, but it's a societal subject that isn't ""misogny"" and exist in everyone's daily life, particularly for mgtow that are still dating. Misogyny isn't any negative remark about womn no matter the context and you can very well discuss ""negative things"" if you really discuss them and their societal components and effects (outside of your own personal tastes). 


No comment on the second exemple though, this one is perfectly fair. At this point I wonder if it's not even transcending misogyny somehow but I don't know if there's a word for it. It feels more like good old discrimination."

And if you seriously think that child support is only for the children, and not for the benefit of the mother, then you're either a liar or an idiot.

Child support is fundamentally unjust. Either we have split custody, in which case you support the children when you have them and I support the children when I have them, or you stole my children, in which case, fuck you.

It would be awesome to have a comparison of families *with the same living standard* without a father and with a father.

They have nothing to fall back on, they have no clue in how to make money, and all they know how to do is save. If they are in really bad shape, they come from a home funded by welfare, and so all they know about is that society owes them and the government should support them.

Every day I feel a big hole in my life that will never be filled and I'm extremely frustrated because I think I lack of something important. In my opinion some of my problems and issues wouldn't exist if I just could have had my dad around in my life. 
The fact that I always was closer to my dad and felt more understood by him made losing him and growing up without him even worse. 

I have to say that I don't see myself in the listed points except for sex point. I lost my virginity pretty early (for a rather sad reason but that's another story, but don't worry about me, I wasn't forced to do this in any way), already had 3-4 guys with whom I got sexual, the total amount of me having sex is something between 20 and 25 and I'm only 20 years old.

2) Higher Education for Women: I would say that it's a well known fact that women don't marry down, so why should a women with a university degree marry someone with only a college degree or someone with a lower paying job, this results in that they choose to either go to a sperm bank or get laid by a local Chad/Tyrone and get pregnant without the father in the picture (either Chad/Tyrone or the sperm doner)

For instance, when the single parent loses their temper with the child, no-one else is there to try to calm the parent down and support them to behave better with their child.

Saying ""US department census"" is not a source - you would need to say the year, etc.

Look - the problem with these, which I'm trying to explain, is that let's say you send this to a skeptical person - because I've listed these facts before and people are somewhat skeptical.  I find it nearly impossible to find someone who put together a quality list with quality resources.

Saying - US Census - as a source is stupid.  As a teacher you should know that.  The US census from 1950 or 2010?  Would that change your mind on the information?  Yup.

How about - National Principals Association Report - as if there was only 1 report in the history of time?  How is that a legitimate source.

This is fun for anyone who agrees with you, but when you make a case and are sourcing things - you're doing it for the skeptics or those who may not agree.  This doesn't provide any clarity.  I mean, there is a census statistic from 1988 and then others that just say US census... are they all from 1988?  Are some from the 21st century?  We don't know.

The CDC says that - ""fatherless children blah blah"". When?  The CDC has a website.  The CDC makes publications.  You can't just say that and have anyone believe you.  Was this the CDC in 1980s again?  Or is it the 1990s?  We don't know.  Is it even relevant?  Nope.

Thank you for your post, but please read sidebar rules before posting. 

This is not a men's rights sub. Your post would be more appropriate to post there, or on the mgtow1 sub. 

This sub is for men who are already walking the path of mgtow and for discussions on how to promote that. 

That said, your post will not be removed, you will not incur a ban, and comments will be left open for respectful dialogue and questions should you have any, and as this is NOT the mgtow1 sub or an incel sub, I would not expect a ""warm"" welcome or a flood of upvotes, but it is in the sidebar rules to treat fellow commenters with basic respect when it comes to discussion, and largely our participants here abide by those rules quite well.

The biggest thing to understand about mgtow is that mgtow is NOT a movement. We have no organization, no leaders, no meetings, no rallies or anything else that would qualify a group of like minded people as a movement. 

We are all keenly aware of all that is going on that you mention in your post towards men, and we are doing what you mention in your last paragraph. We are enjoying our own path in this world, without marriage or cohabitation or any of the associated risks."

It's unnecessary and pointless to do so.  Our current situation could never have been possible if men did not eagerly get on board to make it so.  It is what it is.  Laying blame accomplishes nothing.  I think that most of the steps that led our society to where it is today were undertaken by people with good intentions.

You can't really apologize on behalf of anyone, because it's not like they will stop, so it's just kinda ""meh"". it's not like you have to apologize for anything, It's the people that actually do something wrong that have to apologize.

Also, r/MGTOW2 is more laid-back then the first one, when I posted on here (although I am a man), it was really welcoming. It's not like you are going to be hated for your gender. (Although there could be a handful that would, can't leave out the possibility of it as individuals be individuals.)"

But to make this comment somewhat constructive...

- What beer do the men (does the man) in your life like? What would (will? - hint) his reaction be if you bought them/him a 6 pack?

- When is the intl. men's day?

- When was the last time you prepared him a meal to take to job (if possible, of course).

These are just some easy ones. Probably takes you maybe 1h or so (probably less).

> Most importantly it has taught me about the woman I don't want to be. 

I've been asking what the difference between a female and a woman is for a while now. Perhaps the time of me getting some answers has started, so not all is bad.

Nah, I think you're wrong about that. Pretty sure, actually. Would be surprised if I was wrong.

I don't hate women, and would be in a relationship again, if it weren't for how society is so unfavorable toward me being in a relationship. There's only two options to resolve this as I see it: since you and your sisters now hold the majority of voting power, you'll need to be the ones who correct the system. Feminists have taken the traditional power from men and have given it to women, and so now you are the ones who will be responsible for fixing what's happening. I honestly don't belive this will happen though, and so I'm expecting that the the other option is what will likely occur, that the system will simply have to get so bad again and so many men will walk away first, before the system falls apart, and in that instance, the suffering will be very great for many people, and strong men will once again step in, and probably quite brutally, take power again and restore the classical, stable, patriarchal dynamic that originally founds civilizations and that are typical outside of the short periods that follow last-stage modern societies (Rome for example). I don't want it to be this way, so please do all you can with your sisters to try to restore the dynamic that has worked so well for humans for a millennia."

\- You didn't do it. Nor is your gender even to blame. This is the natural state of our species, when put in this environment-- Women wouldn't act like that if men didn't put them on a pedestal. That is also not to say that men are to blame, because men wouldn't act like that if women weren't so hypergamous. It's a back and forth, and there's not much you can do, besides going your own way, making your own life, and your own happiness.

Besides calling you AWALT has nothing to do with whatever you post-- AWALT is a recognition that as a general rule of thumb, most women act according to their nature, and their nature is hypergamous, and we shouldn't forget that. Even if a woman seems like a ""unicorn"" we should take care of ourselves and minimize risks, because the consequences when we don't, can be fatal."

Nothing personal, but MGTOW doesn't really need support, MGTOW is a realization that, our lives are more important.  As a woman, you understand the importance of ""No."" more than anyone other than us  I'm sure.  We don't want to rape, harass, assault, or whatever else your current complaints are.

Get a bunch of proud, independent lesbian carpenters to build a scaffold on the supreme court courthouse steps, and drag every prominent man-hating feminist author, teacher, professor, and activist up one at a time and lynch them.  You are welcome to have your carpenter women build a guillotine if that's faster.  I mean the French used it to some effectiveness.  Schedule it for Bastille Day for irony.

Then maybe it'll be believed that you care, because you don't.  You relish in your privileges, and, of course, as a proud feminist, which you are, you'll do nothing.  Yelling at us accomplished nothing.  We've checked out of the library.  You can't bring us back with a book mobile.  I'm glad you have the mental capacity to recognize that women have fucked over men for 150 years.  Great, you've almost caught up to the last 15 years of men mentioning it.  So hey, it's always great to come late to the party and leave early.

But no one cares any more.  Enjoy your 40 year cubicle job you fought so strongly for; I mean fuck children or family,  find some black holes or something.  When your eastern european child care worker from some slovakia (nothing against the proud eastern europenans) releases your child to you so you can shove some microwaved hot pockets down its throat, before sending it off to school shelving for eight hours a day, because fuck children, you'll take solace that you bought several cars to transport them.

I hear science and STEM are all the rage.  Again, enjoy that cubicle, I wish you the best of luck.  And have some more socialist shaky grandmas run for political office, that'll work out for you.  I saw you crying your eyes out when she lost.

You women have done NOTHING to help us men and we have asked.

You women owe me more than USD300 million in compensation payments for the crimes I have suffered.

And I most certainly expect you women to pay up."
3056,,"just a few things to say to you...

\-I appreciate your words, you are a woman with honor indeed. it is rare to see an outlier like you who supports the opposite gender, however, you should in fact support your OWN gender equally. dont apologize on behalf of your gender, the majority of women, as much as people will disagree with me here, are level-headed, compassionate, understanding and hard working. these are all amazing qualities, and I will be a very lucky guy when I meet the next woman who I will involve in my story. I can't speak for many men, but  'gynocentricism' in society is bullshit. it's fabrication, it's fiction. keeping a positive mindset is the key to living blissfully. somewhere out there a man will meet you and you will be an incredible support for him. We need more women like you now more than ever...I do NOT believe that men are treated like dirt, I think men are treating THEMSELVES like dirt.

\-I love the fact that you seem to be a positive person. as a man who is \*somewhat affected by loneliness and negativity around me, I will stay positive in spite of it. I CAN speak for many men when I say ""bring it on. I won't be defeated by this. there is more than this. I will come out of this stronger than I was before. I will use this to my benefit."".  us men are tough, but we need to support each other and we need to support our women also. sometimes I wish I had the emotional strength that most women have... and that's another thing. a lot of women simply don't know how strong they truly are... they need to unlock it, women are treating themselves like dirt also,they may be emotionally sensitive, but they are ALSO emotional bodybuilders who can take a LOT of emotional abuse and pain in a way that a lot of men can't. there needs to come a change to where we all understand our power and our value, and what brings positivity and light into our lives. there may never exist unconditional love, but we CAN create unconditional POSITIVITY!

&#x200B;

The Commonwealth countries look like a total dumpster fire in this regard. I don't know if there's any hope of positive change, which I think why MGTOW wants to ""Go Galt"". But without the right to bear arms that will likely only get them so far since the female supremacists are seeking control and aren't likely to sit on their hands while the MGTOW men avoid them."

3060,,"No need to apologize.

Me, myself, Im happy that my mother was a feminist, that she divorced my father for no reason, that she moved to another country and lost touch with him completely.

She, in the process, brainwashed my sister and turned her into a bitter and angry woman. She hated me and tried to destroy me, as passively as possible.

Now, I see the upside: My sister now realizes that all of her youth was poisoned by the bitterness of *another woman*. My mother died and she left my sister with nothing but pain and lies. She hates my mother and she now is awake.

I, never married. I dated, but saw through the BS and gave up on women a long time ago.

And yes, I am a handsome man. The type you cant help looking at.
I attract young women, mature women, all women. But, I see my mother in every one of them.

Many of us are happy in this apathy towards women, we can concentrate on other things, things that actually make a man happy.

Women are a drug, thats it. And as such, they only provide momentary happiness.

AWALT is a sad truth. Men dont want and didnt want this lunacy. But women want it, yearn for it, crave it.

You are just one, thus, it matters not that you have seen the truth or pity us.

The world is gonna burn. And only until then, will women *see* what they have done.

I'm more into politics then philosophy (although still learning about politics). But that being said, I am a Christian, so I do know a bit about Christian morals and some of their philosophy.

3122,reclusiveaggressive1,"I always thought I'd make a good companion, to a good companion.  But what I've learned is that everyone slips up, a little bit or a lot, sooner or later, and again, and again.  And I don't take it well.  If I'm far away for work, and I call my companion, and she says, ""Why are you calling?  Shouldn't you be busy?""  That sort of thing sticks in me.  And, using my free time, I'm inclined to find other people to talk to.

I tell people that I'm gay, now.  But I'm still married to the same woman I married in 2006.  We have separate bedrooms.  We haven't even kissed or tried to have sex since 2013.  It would be weird to hug.  I thought I was staying until her youngest (I've never reproduced, but she had 2 boys when I met her) turned 18, at which point, I'd get a divorce.  But, for some reason I can't explain, I couldn't.  The divorce was drawn-up and paid-for.  She would get all the assets except my vehicle and personal belongings, and I'd get all the debts except the house payment.  I didn't mind the deal.  

So, since 2013, I've cheated on her countless times.  And what I've learned is that I was cheating every one of those people, not my wife.  I was creating a little fiction of a good relationship with some hope, maybe, and excitement and emotion and sex.  But when it came time to really make it real, I broke up with them.  And I miss them, and it hurts terribly.  And I'm alone.  I can't love anyone anymore.  I'm trying to give up on wanting a friend, a lover, a companion.  I'm trying not to miss the hope of one day having someone.  I'm 46, already.  I don't want to put myself, my wife and some poor guy or girl through any more of my bullshit.

I know you wrote this wanting to build bridges, penetrate the isolation,  maybe even defend your gender through your positive example.  But at least some of us need to be isolated.  And all you do is remind us of some beautiful dream that we'll never make real.

If you can ask me why I won't divorce my wife, or why we can't get counselling and become a happy, loving couple again, that will mean you haven't understood anything I've written.  Hell, I'm not sure I understand it."

There aren't any good egalitarian parent-child relationships or egalitarian CEO-intern relationships.

And I firmly believe that all are ""equal"" in that no one is intrinsically worth more or less than anyone else, in fact I think it's evil of egalitarians to claim that a CEO is ""better"" than an intern, simply because of their placement in a hierarchy, or that a parent is ""better"" than their child, or that a leading husband is ""better"" than his wife. This is stupid and evil, and egalitarianism comes from this lie. Men and women ARE equal, even when they are in a structured hierarchical relationship, each with different roles, responsibilities, and benefits. Feminists lie that women have had a worse lot than men throughout history (men have always had to protect, provide, and die for their families) just so that they can try to have their cake and eat it too. Egalitarianism doesn't work. Either men will rule or women will rule. A ship has to have a captain, and someone has to be responsible, and whether you like it or not, the person responsible also needs to have authority, these fall apart when you separate them. You have to pick one, and so far, this experiment over the last 60 years or so with women taking power hasn't seemed to make things better for people or make them happier.

Here there are probably fewer upvotes. Probably fewer comments, but much more genuine support you can get if you are telling a personally-happened-to-me-what-do-i-do story or question, and more of a chance for you to help men by leading by example of how mgtow helps you in your life."

3191,Impossible-asset,"It would be removed under cartoons, memes, and anime and you would get a message stating what rule it broke, and a reminder that the sub is for focusing on men, not women and a more appropriate post would be you cooking your own steak or something along those lines that moves the focus from women to men. 

If you posted something that broke the rules again, youd be temporarily banned."

What I want this sub to be is a place where men can share their progress in life and happiness that mgtow brings them. And memes that are basically just ""wahmen love the cock, amiright fellas?"" Dumbs down that conversation. 

So if this isnt for you, I wish you well. Safe travels and find a spot you can well received with the memes. I'd recommend mgtow1 or the red pill as good subs for that kind of content."

Let's just accept all negatives about everything, including women. Ok? That's the baseline. Be independent, whatever the cause; that's the situation you're in.   
Now let's move on to focus on coping and flourishing in life, independently. Identifying shortcomings of independence, and how to adapt to overcome them for continued success.  
Example: I have to get a surgery done, but I won't get released from the hospital unless I'm able to have someone drive me home. What are my options? Can I call Lyft/Uber? Will I need to employ a day-nurse service? What should I discuss with my doctor to get the care I need despite not having someone to assist?  
Example 2: I have a pet and need to leave town for a couple days. What are my options for pet care ? What advantages are there to using a neighborhood kid compared to a pet boarding service? Here's what I learned when I did this...   
etc.  
There's plenty to talk about in life  and have lively discussions without being a wet blanket for gender issues. Anyone who doesn't understand this really doesn't understand MGTOW at all."
3328,Xemnas81,"I think this is a great idea, albeit I think there still needs to be a redpill rage sandbox"
3329,GlobalAsshat,"I was giving this subreddit some space for the same reason... it's pointless to get angry at women because they are BIOLOGICALLY WIRED through several hundred thousand years of evolution to act the way they do. It's like getting mad at your black lab for eating baby rabbits or your cat for killing birds and mice. The whole reason to forgive and release women from the bitterness is not for their sake, it's for your, the man's sake, so you can get closure, move forward, and decide what path you will take now that you have these new rules of the game you didn't know about. You went through the red pill rage, the blue pill conditioning has been shattered... so be it. Time to move on. 

Not everyone has the same level of self discipline and for most people these animalistic cravings are stronger than their rational mind... look at all the billionaires getting caught with underage girls... so I preach  self improvement to get better at the game for young MGTOW so they don't go through life bitter, accept their biology, and get some good sex... I preach self mastery because it's the way you get abundance mentality and self confidence and rewire your brain to have the life you want, and become the best version of yourself...seems like they don't want to hear it.. they'd rather live their lives engrossed in porn, fapping, junk food, and video games, while making memes about how trashy women are, and then refuse to look in the mirror.... that they're humorless, passive aggressive pussies with no personality like I used to be.. that's the main reason they can't get women. 

They don't like that women are attracted to dominant, cocky men.. they likely get a feeling of rage inside them whenever they see such a male in public interacting with women and watching her fall so easily for his flirtations. You can't help a person in this state, they have to want to help themselves and make the changes.... plus you have the older ones who have already checked out from the game, the 45 year olds telling the 17 year olds to check out from the game at 17 and it's just terrible advice.

The main problem with our species in general is we don't teach self discipline at all, and yet we have unchecked access to dopamine producing addictive stimuli, from fapping to stupid phone games like clash of clans, junk food, facebook, etc.  This unchecked pleasure fucks up our brain's reward system and makes us numb zombies.
I won't be posting here as much... I can't post here. Time is precious and I can't spend it all on the internet. It's time to live what I've been preaching.... I'd say that's the main problem that the mods here will have... once a guy reached a certain level of personal development, he's likely to do things like not be on the internet hours a day... the type of subreddit you desire will be difficult to achieve."
3330,Setari,"Thank you, sincerely.

I would post more ""successful"" things about my life but as it stands it's pretty stale, I'm happy and boring. Sure I could post video game successes but there's other subreddits for that, and that's pretty much my only hobby.

I do appreciate the ramp in moderating though."
3331,DangZagnut,"Perhaps you need more mods to monitor it on a regular basis.  Only having two is not a guarantee of moderating content with enough vigor to ""police"" the forum.  

And I'm not talking dick, always quiet, banning with no explanation mods, but more a ""hey, is this OC going anywhere not violating subreddit rules?"" kind of moderation."
3332,,"To pipe in ; no one cares about the food someone has eaten, so i don't see why those kinds of posts should be allowed - anyone can go outside and get food, regardless of whether you are married/dating or not. Please consider filtering these picture posts as well, for an idea of what it ends up like one only needs to look at the main subreddit. Hiking? yeah that's cool, but going outside to buy food and posting it online like an instagram slut saying ""look at my MGTOW day out"" is extremely tiring and obnoxious (it also takes zero effort and breaches rule 4). Making healthy food is something i'd like to see in posts, not unhealthy and easily bought restaurant food.. it's a fine line but maybe consider a filter.

Good work mod, doing gods work here.

3333,Artichoke19,"I‚Äôm fed up of rampant unapologetic, vitriolic and (genuine) misogyny/misandry both on reddit and elsewhere on social media. There‚Äôs enough ugliness in the world gender-based hatred from either end of the divide is equally boring and disappointing and ultimately doesn‚Äôt help bring society any closer together again.
There‚Äôs got to room for mildly-MGTOW/MGTOW-adjacent men like myself who balk at the vitriol but see value in researching/pursuing all other aspects to the lifestyle.

Could rename the sub to ‚Äòr/MGTOWgains‚Äô, ‚Äòr/MGTOWwins‚Äô or something similar, so it‚Äôs more apparent and/encourages more positive or practical/advice content?"
3334,Last_Avenger,"Life isn't always a fun happy positive experience, sometimes it's balls to the wall hard, and there's increasingly less and less places for men to vent their frustrations...

&#x200B;

This post seems a little bit petty.   If things were positive, why would you reject having children?  Why would you ignore women completely?  Why even discuss anything at all? That's just not natural... MGTOW is an ideology but not a religion.  We should be encouraging men to vent and be vocal, (whether it's positive or not)."
3335,chalchium,"This is going to be challenging.

I remember a few weeks ago there was this guy asking how to plan for very old age. The top voted answer is to have a gun for the head, with nothing else. Nobody bothered with a more detailed answer on things like old-age related illness, place to retire or some form of elderly-care plan. It seems most guys here aren't ready to face the music of life yet, but rather living on a quick escapism before going back to plantation.

Quite a few posts on the front page are even struggling with women and seeking comfort from breaking-up. If anyone still desires women at this stage, this isn't the reddit for you. However if this is the case, this reddit would have no posts. we do need to realize even within MGTOW, most guys aren't ready yet."
3336,fmanly,"Honestly, I think you're looking to ban the only thing everybody here has in common, which is the decision to move away from marriage and cohabitation.  Beyond that we aren't going in the same direction, and there are already other subs for it.

If I wanted to talk about hiking, I'd join a hiking sub.  If I wanted to talk about travel, I'd join a travel sub.  And so on.  And I do participate in many subs related to my hobby.

Really, the main thing I come here looking for is discussion about how men/women relate from a MGTOW perspective, but with more focus on insight than random memes/shitposting/etc.  Something I might hear from Stardusk/huMAN/etc.

But, rules are rules and I'm more than happy to obey.  I just suspect you may find not many people being interested in other people's hobbies..."
3337,Blexit2020,"I hate to add my two cents to this because technically, I don't really belong here, but I just like helping people who are at a point where they feel broken down in life and giving advice. I don't think that venting one's anger and frustration via the ever-common ""red pill rage"" is, in itself, a bad thing. It's when it becomes a pattern and one's main focus that it becomes problematic. Also, the lack of others commenting more uplifting material that focuses on the *person* venting as opposed to the *reason* they're venting is what creates that vortex of negativity that's hard to dig out of.

I think venting is a good thing. You have to have an outlet to empty that poison before it consumes you. The venting isn't the problem, it's the equally, if not more, negative responses from other users that drive a simple vent session down a path of being very unhealthy. Commentors should be uplifting and redirecting these, very much expected, rage laments to more healthy coping mechanisms and offer support and encouragement.

I suffer from depression, PTSD, and panic attacks from anxiety. And I've wound up in the hospital a couple of times because of this. Much like an AA or NA meeting, they have daily group therapy sessions where people are given the opportunity to pour their hearts out and just *be heard* by someone who is willing to listen. The therapist is there to not only act as a listener, but also a ""moderator"" of sorts to help patients redirect their negative thoughts in a more positive direction. Even other patients who have had similar experiences are encouraged to redirect and offer positive support and advice to each other and none of that entails giving too much attention to the *source* of the problem (i.e. the people who hurt them). The attention is focused on the individual and being supportive in a way that is healthy and encourages introspection and self-love.

So, I don't think barring users from their ""red pill rage vents"" is necessarily the best way to go, but again, I'm not a mod nor even MGTOW or a man, so I'm not trying to step on anybody's toes. I'm just offering a suggestion because I see what you're trying to do here and it is a good thing; you want this sub to influence positivity and self-growth. I just think the vent posts aren't what need to be policed so much as it is the *comments.* The sub r/raisedbynarcissists has an Auto Moderator bot that replies with the ""do's and don'ts on how to respond to posts."" Maybe you could create a ""Vent"" flair for such posts and then this Auto Moderator bot would be programmed to reply with rules on how to properly respond to vent posts with positivity and failing to follow the rules for such posts will result in comment removal. 

Not only would this allot for users to still have their vent moments, it also serves as a way to help others cope through their anger, find encouragement, and also makes it easier on you as a moderator to keep an eye on such posts for violations in the comments by giving such posts their own category. 

Again, I'm not trying to tell you how to run a sub that I shouldn't even be in in the first place, lol. I just wanted to throw some ideas out there for keeping the atmosphere you're trying to maintain, here, positive while also taking into account human nature. Sometimes, venting, however vitriolic, is healthy and necessary; especially if in your offline life you're given very few, if any, opportunities and spaces to do so. And the best place to vent is in a place that makes a point not to reinforce your negative thoughts, but instead offer support and positive thinking. At the end of the day, most people in vent mode not only want to be heard, but they also want to know they're not alone and be given hope for better days."
3338,KaptajnKLO,"Do you want a dead sub? Cause that's how you get a dead sub. There's only so much you can talk about if you are only allowed to discuss the journey of being a mgtow.

It will become boring real fast.

 If you can't talk about the REASON why you are mgtow, then you are limiting the sub to a far too narrow subject. And the REASON IS WOMEN! If you can't discuss the main reason of why you are going mgtow, then what's the point of a mgtow forum? I think it would be ridiculous to enforce these rules of yours, I'd much rather things continue as they are now with maybe a more strict policing on posts that outright spew hatred towards women."

3352,Impossible-asset,"I'll use your 'walking the dog"" post as an example. 

If you post a picture of your dog and you out for a walk,  and the commentary is: 
""Best bitch in my life. If you want loyalty, this is the best you can get. Me and max, mgtow all the way, no need for awalts when we have a beach walk and a sunset. Ex gf said it was me or the dog. Kicked that bitch to the curb the next day. All she wanted was control. She probably moved in with some Chad because she found a new place to stay awfully fast of you know what I mean"" ... 

well, that post will probably be removed. Because the focus isnt you and your dog, it's not even mgtow related, it's just using a picture of a dog to post underlying  vitriol towards women. And that shit isnt healthy. 

Post the same picture, and caption it:

18 months ago, the ex told me it was her or my dog, Max. Yeah he sheds, and pants, and she just did not like him from the second she moved in. Had him since he was a pup, and hes addicted to digging holes at the beach so things can get a little sandy when we get home sometimes.  She always made snide comments about him, and one day just gives the ultimatum ""me or the dog"". Easy choice for me..she moved out that weekend. 

Now here we are. We're on mile two of our daily walk. I would have been unhappy every day since if I had made the other choice. Always remember who your real friends are, and dont let anyone give you an ultimatum like that. Sunset is looking great, so me and max are going to stop and take it in for a bit. 

... ...

It's not that you post a picture of your dog on a walk. It's the thinking behind it. It's the context of it. The first guy is posting it on a mgtow sub and using his dog to spew anger. The second is a guy who escaped a toxic situation and is giving perspective on the results of walking away."

I'm here for discussion of MGTOW, Redpill and being men in today's society, and if I can't talk about these stuff or I have to explicitly state everything by ""how is this MGTOW"" or ""how is this seen in positive light"", I don't see the point of this sub for me.

Like something you always wanted to do but couldn't because (pick your reason: the ex-wife wouldn't let you; the ex gf always denigrated the idea; etc etc) but now you just smoked your first brisket, perfected the recipe and the guests for the bbq arrive in an hour and it was your going mgtow that made it possible for you.

As one of the originators (under a different account like ~3+ years ago) of the [""MGTOW **Cooking**"" thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/search?q=MGTOW+Cooking&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) idea...

-
It **was *emphatically* NOT** to post a picture of a plate of food (whether the person cooked it or bought it).
-
 
**Rather it was to instruct & encourage MGTOW men into cooking full/better meals for themselves** -- as being Healthier, Cheaper, and just overall Better for them in every way -- and moreover that (with just a bit of prep/planning) *contrary to women's gripes*... cooking is NOT difficult NOR all that time/effort consuming (same with the cleanup).

-
To that end, the ""model"" posts (see examples below) contained costs, prep & cooking information, and so on, etc -- **NOT** ""recipes"" *per se* -- but general ""here's how EASY this shit is.""

Examples (things I myself posted): 

* https://old.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/a2j38n/mgtow_cooking_chicken_quarter_potatoes_carrots/

* https://old.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/a54059/mgtow_cooking_cheap_easy_gooood_countrystyle_pork/

* https://old.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/aqvmmv/mgtow_cooking_super_fast_5_minute_deviled_eggs/

Note that while all of those threads **contained** photos (typically more than one, showing process/steps/stages)... none of them directly LINKED to a picture via the thread title; again because the point **wasn't** to be some /r/IAteThis thing.

-
Unfortunately... a lot of ""newbies"" just DON'T get it... they prefer the ""low effort"" of just posting a pic of a plate of food.  And [even a NICELY worded ""reminder"" or ""suggestion""](https://old.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/caefsk/mgtow_cooking_i_made_this_sockeye_salmon/et8k46s/)... gets downvoted and denigrated.

Basically the reason that a HUGE portion of content in these forums (not just r/MGTOW, but anywhere; including /r/MGTOW2 *as the number of subscribers increases*) ends up being ""low effort"" stuff (including **whinging & ranting,** memes & food pics, pics of cars {even if NOT really their car, but only something they're *drooling* over, etc) -- is because **that's what gets UPVOTED** -- that's what the majority LIKE.

---
EDIT: I suppose I should note that the ""MGTOW Cooking"" **also *wasn't* intended to be some quasi-gourmet ""one-up-man-ship"" contest...** it *WASN'T* supposed to be about playing ""Gordon Ramsey"" (or whatever other ""celebrity"" chef nonsense) with some effete *haute cuisine* complex-recipe stuff -- some faux-humblebrag *""roasted salmon eggs sauteed in goat-butter with fresh arugula sprouts & hand-harvested sea-salt""* bullshit -- because THAT too (making cooking SEEM to be needlessly over-complex) **is ""contrary"" to the original points & purpose:** frugality, ease, health, etc."
3360,Impossible-asset,"I would maintain that there is a difference between venting frustrations, and just whinging. 

Too often ""venting frustrations"" in posts is really a whinge fest of ""I cant get laid so I'm pissed about it and now I am going to talk about all the times I was treated poorly, then say I'm going full monk mode mgtow and wait to get a dose of dopamine from seeing the upvotes and reading comments that are similar in tone that also bash on women."" 

And that is simply not acceptable for this sub. There are other places for that on reddit to vent those kinds of frustrations. 

If you want to discuss mgtow and women, even ""the nature of women"", then go ahead. Just frame the conversation carefully. From a perspective of moving yourself forward on a path towards your own independence, and the challenges and successes you have found along the way. 

If you want to ignore women completely? Ok. Why? And what has doing that gained you? Has ignoring women completely actually been harmful to you? What was the outcome of it?

Did you reject having kids? If so, why? What have you found that by making that decision you find yourself in a better position in life? Has it been a positive or a negative?  Would you consider adoption and being a single parent?  ... there are lots of discussions to be had. 

The problem I am trying to address in this post is what boils down to posts and comments basically just being slanted more towards ""women suck"", and not ""mgtow is freedom"" (to steal big John's catch phrase). 

You have a point. Mgtow is a result of gynocentric society giving women an outright endorsement for divorce rapes, metoo fiascos, workplace sexual harassment and alllll that other bad behavior. Walking away from that is self-preservation and a move to be successful and thrive in adverse circumstances. 

And this sub is designed for men to discuss with eachother how they have been able to navigate those waters successfully, and give advice to those who may be struggling with doing so. But not by just complaining about the problem of women."
3361,Pliyii,"Young guys have very active penises, they won't ever *not* struggle with the challenge of going their own way. I think that's why they love to post this shit.

Lots of guys that would be there otherwise come here (I think) since that Reddit doesn't exist anymore and they have been banned from r/mgtow."
3362,Impossible-asset,"I offer the hobbies and lifestyle stuff as an example, not as an order of ""this is all that is allowed here.""

The aim is to quell the increasingly pain in the ass load of moderating posts and comments that are focuses on the negative traits of women. That is a waste of your time, my time, and everyone elses time. 

I'd you have something to post about how men and women relate from a mgtow perspective, for example, how do you deal with women now in casual social settings? Or hey the Daily Prophet just published an article about marriage rates being down over 80% because men are refusing to give rings, then sure go ahead. 

Even if you were treated badly in a relationship and want to post about your experiences you can. Just dont post it in a light of negativity. For example compare the two following fictional posts:

Post A:  Man I swear to God AWALT is true. I was married and being your typical overworked blue-pilled plantation simp. Worked all day and then some. Full time plus a part time job. Thought she was AWALT and she had me fooled right up until the day I came home early and I walked in the door and found her getting double-teamed by two Chad's. Right on the sofa. She hadn't given me so much as a blowjob in 6 months, but shes letting her gym ""buddy"" and her part-time coworker tap her ass in the house I'm laying for. Needless to say we got divorced and I lost the house. No kids so no child support, but yeah I got fucked by having to pay alimony to that bitch for 5 years. Life sucks now, but I'm mgtow for sure for life. Awalt guys, awalt. It's as true as the law of gravity. You'll work your ass off and she'll get plowed in the ass by every dick that walks in the door while you're simping to provide her a trick pad. In the end you'll be paying her money, and live in some shitty apartment in the ghetto just to be able to get by. Women are the worst. Awalt and botches all around. Never forget that! Go mgtow and live free.

... ... ...

Contrast that with post B:

I'm sitting here in my studio apartment venting, fellas. 
I'm working full time plus a part time job, all if the part time job goes to the alimony I have to pay from the divorce. But only for 22 more months, then I'll be free of that. 

Background is I was happily married or so I thought. Still worked the two jobs to pay for the house. And one day thought I'd surprise the wife with dinner when I gave up a shift to a coworker. Got home with the wine and stuff to cook, and walked in the front door to my wife getting double pumped by two guys.ended up getting divorce-rape, but not so bad since there were no kids. Split the house in the sale so I got enough to at least keep me afloat. And alimony for 5 years. Could have been a lot worse! 

Since then life has been austere for me. I live in a studio apartment on the wrong side of the tracks, but I can still put money back and save up a bit into a Vanguard fund. Not much, but progress is progress. 

Remember that marriage is a bad contract for you. If I had put all that effort into myself vs just trying to make the ""love of my life"" happy, I could have retired quite comfortably by now. It's ok. I still plan to, 22 months and I'll get a 25% raise when I dont have to pay alimony anymore and I have learnt through painful experience that my time and effort and money are best spent on myself. Learn from my mistakes so you dont have to live by my example. 

... ....

Both of these posters relay a similar experience. But which one has the positive frame? Which one is going to generate a comment line of support for him, vs just thread after thread of ""fuck women"" commentary?

That's what I'm talking about here. Getting away from discussion that is so slanted toward the negative. 

More and more posts make me feel like I'm reading the equivalent of someone who gets canned at work and storms out saying ""You cant fire me, because I QUIT, who needs this job anyway."" (I dont want any of these women anyway, so if they dont want me, that's fine, I'm going mgtow).

There is a **significant** problem with this that you are overlooking:
-
A **LOT** of ""hobby"" and ""interest"" stuff -- especially the stuff that get's specific (example projects, etc) -- can then (at least potentially) be used to ""dox"" (or inadvertently ""out"") the individual in real life... to neighbors, coworkers, etc.

I think a lot of that just reflects the growth of MGTOW.  People who are new to MGTOW are going to tend to be raging, because many of them are either dealing with a huge shock of having their old dreams shattered, or even worse dealing with legal battles, support payments, or even criminal accusations and job loss.

Now, sadly, there are a lot of MGTOW who never grow past this, and I think that what you're trying to do here is probably going to help a lot of people make it further down the road towards healing.  

However, one thing we all have to remember is that every day there are over two thousand men getting divorced, and that says nothing about guys getting kicked out of their houses who are cohabitating and any number of other difficult situations.  Those guys are not going to be in a good mood, and in a week there are two of these freshly-divorced guys out in the world for every regular in this sub.  Obviously they don't all come here, but eventually some do.

Maybe we need some kind of MGTOW2 Trauma Center Advice in the sidebar or something.  Something along the lines of ""Are you angry?  Well, you probably should be.  However, we are here not just to listen to your frustrations, but also to help you grow stronger so that you won't get hurt like this again.  You owe it to yourself to read on, and please do so before venting here...""  Rage is to be expected, so we need to find ways to channel it while maintaining the sort of tone you want to achieve, so that those moving past rage can have the environment they also require, and maybe this will also help them to help out somebody new.

In any case, thanks again for taking the time to genuinely share your frustrations.  As somebody who moderates other forums (not MGTOW-related) I know it is a completely thankless job and any action you take will have far more people stepping up with complaints than thanks."
3386,Blexit2020,"I mostly meant expressing anger toward their own personal and very specific situations, but I get what you're saying. The other sub just doesn't seem good for the soul; especially not a soul that is vulnerable after being hurt. 

I just don't see how healing can be achieved in the other sub for those new to MGTOW. If they somehow end up here first and are in ""red pill rage"" mode, I think this sub is better at helping someone calm down, find healing and direction in life. The other sub may just make them worse. But, again, I definitely understand what you mean about the ""infectious"" nature of such posts, so I'll leave it alone."
3387,Blexit2020,I encourage you to email the mod team of this sub with your concerns.
3388,Impossible-asset,"Mgtow is about freedom. Its about reclaiming your independence from a gynocentric society and marriage contracts that put you in an untenable position in life. 

What this sub is NOT is just another space to bitch about your frustrations with women. There are PLENTY of subs that will cater to that need. 

Going mgtow carries with it challenges along the way. This place is for people who have gotten past the entire need to dwell on the shortcomings of women and the marriage contract, and focus on overcoming the challenges that lie ahead for them on their mgtow journey. Can some of this be relates back to an experience with a woman? Sure. For example, I'm not going to remove a post where a recently divorced man is asking mgtow men for advice on how were they able to make alimony payments and not be living in a tent. What options are out there for him?  I wont remove a post from a guy who wants to be a monk and is asking about the best way to accomplish that. 

But one thing that is a problem is people say ""mgtow is about freedom, so there should be no restrictions then right? Well, no. There need to be restrictions on some things In place to keep the direction of the sub moving forward and not just spinning wheels in a mud pit of complaining about women, which is what is starting to happen a little too frequently."

I think you're missing the point: which is that people (yes even here in /r/MGTOW2) just **don't** upvote solid/substantive content...

-
They actually seem to PREFER the ""low effort"" stuff -- the ""/r/IAteThis"" pics of some drive-thru/takeaway/restaurant meal, etc -- **Why do they *prefer* such?** 

Probably because it's also ""low effort"" to just *look at a picture* (esp from mobile) and click ""upvote"" & post some ""looks tasty"" comment... than it is to actually READ much less comment on anything in a more substantive manner."

the other mgtow sub is perfectly fine taking men who want to continue to be angry at women. Once it starts spilling over here, it's like opening the flood gates and before you know it, things get out of control and then down comes the ban hammer on the sub. I prefer to not have to deal with that all together and maintain that this place can be a resource for men that is immensely positive for mgtow and those who currently apply it to their lives or those who have questions on how to do so."

3404,MelodicBrush,"But he has a point lol. What's so bad about posting a negative post, of focusing on women, that's what the movement is about. I am not even angry at women, but maybe someone wants to vent, or someone wants to post a statistic about how women can't drive or whatever, why couldn't that discussion be allowed. 

The original MGTOW isn't like that, the original MGTOW is ""say something that's not overtly negative about women and you get banned"". So lots of people are banned from that place for not complaining enough, why shouldn't they complain a little here?"
3405,Impossible-asset,"Mgtow is NOT about negativity towards women. It is not about animosity. It is for the exact opposite. 

Look in the title of it. MGTOW: MEN, (that's you), GOING (moving in a forward direction to someplace), THEIR OWN WAY (the destination is an individual choice, not set by the expectations of society). 

If you want to just sit around and complain that women cant drive, or cant cook anymore or women women women complaints, there are plenty of subs that will be happy to accommodate you. 

Yeah, the other sub is overrun with much more negative content than positive. (Its not 100%, there are still some good posts). But when you let negativity start building, it will become just like that. 

This sub is intended for positive discussion about mgtow. What have YOU been able to achieve in your journey now that you are not constrained by committing resources to pursuing or maintaining relationships with women."
3406,MelodicBrush,"Yes exactly, it's in the name. MGTOW (as opposed to what they usually end up with, women). 

If no problems existed with women this movement wouldn't exist. 

Again, I am here because I didn't follow AWALT (I assume) and I got banned after my second comment there. So... I am definitely not hateful. 

How do you want to have only people showing of how they improved if you can't give them a place to discuss and get feedback on their problems? Before a man can show you how MGTOW has helped him, MGTOW has to help him. And you are denying that. Basically you're giving 2 options:

1. Be a completely hate filled cunt on MGTOW

2. Be a sucess story, with no problems, confusion or anger and boast with your travel pictures on MGTOW2.

The problem is the average man can not bridge the gap between the two subs or get to this sub already changed and helped by the movement.

Driving etc. Can be a good discussion, I don't agree but you could make a totally logical argument that they shouldn't drive because of the danger that they then impose on you, just like you could make one about young kids."
3407,Impossible-asset,"All for men posting questions and asking for help with their problems as well. That's also what the sub is for.

Since I'm never going to have kids or a wife to look after me, I need to be physically fit well into old age. And since I'm going to be fit and have a non dad-bod I might as well look nice to show off my hard work. So I dress nice as well. Not so much to show off wealth, but as a badge of honor. Kind of like showing off your artwork in a museum. 

I've noticed that since I started dressing nicer and have a nicer physique than most men, people treat me with more respect. Which then opens up more opportunities. Employers want to hire me simply because I look younger and healthier and can do more work than men half my age. 

Anyway, the point of this is that sometimes consumerism is a means to an end. I respect your rejection of conspicuous consumption, but consider that sometimes it (having nice clothes) can help MGTOW men."

3447,,"ha ha ha ha!  What a **GREAT POST**.

This needs to be said a lot more.

YES frugality repels a lot of people. At social gathering nobody wants to hear someone who lives within their means, they all want to hear from the big spenders and strategies to rob Paul to pay Peter. and OPM and similar crap.

Like OP I live within my means, I always have, even when I was married (I have been married/divorced twice), and that at times was an item of contentions in my marriages, more so in the first one than in the second one.

A must of MGTOW is to be or become financially sound, /r/personalfinance and /r/financialindependence can help.

it's amazing the amount of money that guys spend on women and women-related activities, from dating activities, to peacocking, to . . .   whatever.  

Like OP I live frugally, and people who know me superficially think that I am a financial loser.  People who know me a bit better are confused since I don't fit the ""normal"" stereotype since I dress frugally, don't have anything flashy, don't spend that much money, I often go to free or cheap event, I go to a cheap gym **and yet** I live in a very nice place and I vacation frequently in Europe.

Add to it the ""mantra"" of developing one's career and interest and the end result is that MGTOW has great financial ramifications.

In any case, I have a very biased perception that if most men goes through the steps:

1. stops worrying about attracting woman

2. stops worrying about what people think about him in general

Some significant level of frugality will come naturally. Sure, there are some expensive things that we might not want to give up (big bed, cool haircut), but I would expect that things would reprioritized (areas to live, car, places to go on weekends, etc)."

Taking care of yourself and improving yourself is part of what MGTOW means. Having more resources means that you can afford to look better and live better than you would have on the plantation. Personally I am also a minimalist, I have what I need, but I buy the best of what I need. When I wear clothes, I wear what I want and is comfortable with, but I do not look like a bum. I look good to myself. I drive a fancy car (a C63 AMG), because I want it. And I paid cash for it. I live in a condo in a golf estate. And I paid cash for it.

Everyone laughed at me for driving worn out cars and being frugal.   My kids are now in college and I talked to my financial adviser about taking $50,000 dollars out of the stock market and putting it in an account for college.   I was worried until he said that is only 5% of what you have in the market.  In 1 year if the market still moves up at 8.5%  you will have made that money back.   That is when it hit me, this savings snowball that I started at 18 is getting really really big.

I am not here to discuss investments or the stock market.   The point to the story is if you save money at an early age over time it is awesome!

 ‚ÄúThe reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.  
Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.  
But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

3492,squeegypeegy,"So I‚Äôve searched it myself, and it seems as though it‚Äôs not a *much* cheaper alternative to flying. Moreover, it doesn‚Äôt have the same focus (the itineraries I saw were kinda all over the place, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing) as flying does. However, it still sounds like a very cool way to travel, and I may be able to use it in the future. Thanks for letting me know about it!"
3493,flyinghorse1,Haha i'm no salty in the sense of bitter - i'm just careful with money to a fault.
3494,flyinghorse1,I actually live in Vietnam so I know all about cheap countries (for better and for worse)
3495,palaceposy6706,"Eh, it's more than validation. People treat you differently based on how you're dressed, and this can open up doors and opportunities for you. I believe any man who has any dealing with society should make an effort to look his best; you don't need to piss away money on expensive shit to do this."
3496,AliBarakat,That's true. It is best to buy quality clothes and to wear them until they rip apart. Usually I only wear my good clothes when going out or to a special occasion. I wear my old clothes at home and at work so that my new clothes receive less wear.
3497,AliBarakat,"Well you will look like shit wearing some used sandals from the 90s, with dirty ripped socks, and $2 pants and a t-shirt from Goodwill that are oversized and have holes in them."
3498,IBudgetForIt,I'd be up for an interview. Send me a direct message if interested.
3499,fmanly,"Check out /r/leanfire or /r/financialindependence .  The former is probably a better place attitude-wise, though the latter has a lot more resources and covers the principles just fine.  The problem is that the latter has really gotten taken over by people who just can't have enough.  FI used to be about frugality, but now that sub is full of posts like ""I only have $5M in savings and I am really worried that if something bad happened I might have to sell one of my vacation houses.""

Anybody who is MGTOW should definitely look into FI though - the principles as far as the math/finance/tax stuff are completely applicable.  Basically you minimize your expenses, avoid debt, and save lots of money, and at some point your passive income becomes sufficient to cover your expenses.  The rest is just knowing how much you need to save and how to do it in the most efficient way.  But, you don't have to obsess over the finance/tax stuff because if you have no consumer debt and an emergency fund you're already ahead of 99% of the population."
3500,IBudgetForIt,"I live in Los Angeles. So I get paid enough to cover the high cost of housing, but I just pocket all that extra money since I pay no rent :)"
3501,palaceposy6706,I think we all know who the troll is.
3502,Double_A_92,"But don't they *literally* break? Mine usually start disintegrating after 1 year, especially the sole. At that point I'd rather just go barefoot... Or buy at least some discount 10$ sneakers somewhere."
3503,MelodicBrush,"Also sometimes depends on correct fit and well.. your weight. I am pretty light, and my athletic shoes last 2 years. My ...partner... ^(please no ban) has her cheap ones last for 6 years and they show no sign of giving up, because she is really light."
3504,MelodicBrush,"Um. So I am confused, how is Europe a cheap choice then?"
3505,,Is shallow: wonders why he attracts shallow women
3506,Orome2,"Ahh, I figured.  In a low cost of living area there would be almost no reason to not get a place.  The nice thing is, you could pocket/invest the extra money then retire early and move elsewhere."
3507,Mods_eat_children,What shoes do you buy?
3508,flyinghorse1,Its only 300$ to fly back home to Europe but to Chile the flights are 800$ one way
3509,AliBarakat,Women are all the same.
3510,IBudgetForIt,"Yup, that's exactly my plan."
3511,dontlookformehere,"Nike, and mine do the same. Finally broke down and bought about five different pair of shoes that I rotate and I don't wear out the soles till they fall off anymore"
3512,MelodicBrush,"Oh so you aren't Vietnamese. Because for a Vietnamese person that is far more expensive. Still. Japan should be far cheaper in flights from Vietnam than Europe. Also look for return flights, in my experience they're for cheaper that way. I just bought a ticket to Vietnam for 600 euro, and to China for 450 euro, both well in advance. But I've seen tickets from Hanoi to Japan going for as little as $150."
3513,,Oooohh I bet that will get you like +20 karma reddit fag
3514,NohoTwoPointOh,"Rotation is the key.  For dress shoes, buy once cry once.  I have a pair of Florishiems that have been with me since the Mulroney days.  Resoled them a few times, but never wear them more than 2x per week.  Thrift stores are great.  I found a pair of Allen Edmonds at a Goodwill.  Sent them in to be refitted for $160 dollars.  That was over 12 years ago. They still look brand new. Mix in a cheaper pair and you'll be set. Make sure you immediately put cedar shoe trees in your shoes after taking them off. You can find them on eBay for cheap.

For athletic shoes, I find New Balance and Saucony to be durable.   Again, rotate between 3 pair, wearing no two pair consecutively, if possible. I use cheap plastic shoe trees for trainers.  Rotating your socks daily (or more in hot climates) and using foot powder also keeps them nice. The moisture from sweat will eat them up quickly.

Like tires in a car, shoes are the only thing between you and your mobility.  Treat your feet well."
3515,AliBarakat,"Yeah, but it's not like it can cure gay."
3516,palaceposy6706,"Agreed. Rotation, giving them a chance to dry out keeps your shoes *and* your feet happy. Much less problems with fungal stuff too."
3517,,"All black people are the same, arabs too"
3518,AliBarakat,So white people are all the same too.
3519,,Everyone is the same

3521,ImJacksThrowaway,"Women dont want a partner they want a caretaker. Ironically its getting and being ""successful"" with women that made me go mgtow because its then you realise they are mostly all the same, and you cant spend all your time looking for a unicorn. 

MGTOW isnt for men who cant its for whose who wont and just have better things to do."
3522,13Heathens,"I think it's more than just sex and loneliness.

It's also to have someone to be there to support you and care for you; even when you're down.

  
But there are those that's in it for the ""free"" sex and move on to the next conquest when they get bored.

And some that pursues and stay at it due to their insecurities.

&#x200B;

That said, the cons and risks outweighs the pros and rewards these days.

Sex is readily available, and escorts are going to be better looking and better skilled.

Love and loyalty from the current generation of women is almost non-existent.

&#x200B;

So yea, I'm not risking my time, resources and a chance at a bad heartbreak."
3523,Snakerspug,"No the guys that give up are not mgtow. They just give up for a time being and keep trying and failing due to a lot of reasons mainly loneliness and pressure from family. 

I agree with your reason. Its a hassle, after you take care of your sexual desires theres literally no need for women. And kids are just a distraction and separate the man and woman."
3524,801735,"1. MGTOW is not for everybody.

2. Not all MGTOWs are monk.

3. No marriage, no cohab does not mean no relationships. Makes things difficult because females can't cope/deal with it, but I'm sure there are a few out there who resign, submit, deal with it and take what they can."
3525,Gordon-G,Men Guarding Their Own Wallets MGTOW
3526,Impossible-asset,"This is inaccurate. 

Mgtow men can have girlfriends quite successfully. 

My uncle did exactly that. Never got married, never cohabitate or financially supported his girlfriend of 17 years. She was happy with it, and so was he. 

Never opened himself up to any common law marriage problems or any other difficulties that some with co-mingling assets. 

Some mgtow choose to be monks. Ok. 
Some choose to get pussy on a rental basis from a hooker. Hey that's fine too. 

What makes a guy mgtow is the refusal to cohabitate with or get married to a woman because he is aware of the immense risk involved with that. 
The resources that would be put to that end he uses to better himself.  That's the core of mgtow, and anything beyond that is simply up to the individual man."
3527,Platinum247365,"Well, maybe they should give us a reason to find a partner in the first place."
3528,treble-n-bass,"Sure, I have given up on trying to find a partner.  That's because I'm straight, and my option is women.  I do not want to be a partner with a woman, because I would rather be by myself.  Period, end of sentence.  Is that so hard to understand?"
3529,POPPOPCAP93,"Chris rock had a good joke about this,


Men love unconditionally 


Women love under the condition you can provide something.


A mans friends ask, what does your gf look like?


A womans friends ask, what does he do? The fuck does he do for you ?"
3530,ChiTownBob,MGTOW are just men giving up on women because the women don't WANT to be a partner.   The women want you to be a walking wallet and not a partner.
3531,,Where do you get the idea of even having a partner in the first place? ü§î üòâ
3532,,"Going mgtow simply means to not make compromises on your life in exchange for sex.
Then everyone can do it their own way.
This philosophy is born in opposition to bitter women that ended up facing consequences of their behaviour and want a man to compensate their errors. Since in those cases the effort an the money are not worth a used old pussy it's more logical to refuse and enjoy all other things in life."
3533,Taguroizumo,"Like the end of the ancient greeks and the romans, women and society do not want men to be happy, they want men to live on the plantation.
I honestly hope the chinese rather than the muslims become the next world trend setter because if they don't people and specially women are going to be in for a really shitty time."
3534,car23975,They don't assume. They want you to believe everyone is the same and should do and behave the same. Sounds a lot like freedom.
3535,tramese,it's just another shame....they are getting real scared.  less wallets to leech off of.
3536,brace1101,A lot of time people assume I‚Äôm either focused on my career or that I‚Äôm gay. Just because they can‚Äôt comprehend that someone would not be into the same things they are (aka a relationship)
3537,MarqNiffler,"I will never put a woman in the position of thinking she doesn't have to try any more.  That's what marriage is - it's saying okay, you win, we're together forever, so now you can give up.

Never again.  I want both of us to continue to try and work on the relationship, or to just walk away."
3538,waaatuGAHTfelizx,"Yeah. My mother has been feeling down in the dumps lately and me too to be honest but what I wish she would do for my dad is give him a break because as many mistakes as he has made, all parents make mistakes and it's hard not to when someone is poking a nagging stick  at you all the time. There may be only two of us women in a six person household but our desire for perfection is enough for the whole lot and then some lol."

Meanwhile the Chinese have acquired 4/5 of Africa economically."
3549,ImJacksThrowaway,"It really doesnt take long to check a sub reddit or write a reddit comment. Most Mgtow should have better things to do but it dosent take long to ceheck reddit. 

I check mgtow subs once a week to keep my mind correct, free and clear. Its like an AA meeting of sorts, what do people in AA talk about? alcohol/ drugs they do partly because they know its bad for them a bad habit for them or a bad pattern of behaviour to get back into and they want to live a life free from it. why do people go to AA in the first place? For a sense of community and shared life experience and so they can learn from each other etc etc. It similar to that. 

Talk about what got you here . Why you are here and why its better to remain here. 

You would go to an AA meeting and sulk and say "" all we talk about is drugs and negative stuff!"" because there is an understanding that this is a special place to talk about what you want with the group , and they can even help you stay on the path that benefits you with their input/ experience."
3550,13Heathens,"Yea, and the best escorts have set a real high bar.

&#x200B;

I now understand why people can't stay in marriages these days. There's always that ex that fucks or does something better in some way."
3551,13Heathens,"Yea, this is unfortunate.

The happily married couples I know are either:

1. Old people
2. Girl has low SMV (hypergamy)
3. Newly weds.

But there are more in unhappy marriages or divorced."
3552,Impossible-asset,"They just enjoyed eachother. 
Total opposites, she was maybe 100lbs soaking wet, he was 300lbs.

And she said she always liked his sense of humor. 
So she just stuck around I guess.

She left when she passed away."
3553,iam_the-walrus,I guess I just hate when people go out of their way to put down others and yet put themselves on a pedestal which is what MGTOW seems to be.
3554,ImJacksThrowaway,"Getting your mind to process a mgtow mindset  and integrating it into your life comes in stages many are still in the anger or bargaining phase I imagine that is alot of that you are seeing along with the invasion of pathetic incel types.

 Visiting r mgtow, consuming mgtow content is just the initial step you dont want to be stuck there whats why i only visit the sub at most a few times a month. The quality of the content is shit these days I agree with that but I take a Bruce Lee approach "" absorb what is useful and discard the rest""."
3555,iam_the-walrus,That‚Äôs a very good approach to it and I‚Äôm glad to see not everyone is all bad on MGTOW

3557,donniedarko_1,"Let's not romanticize it.
Lone Wolfs seldom survive a long life and if it does, it's an arduous journey and bitter one with little satisfaction.  The tribe will make sure of that. Everything has its trade offs. 

And yet knowing this, its a heavy price a few are willing to pay. 

Question: what does a lone Wolf say to another lone Wolf in a chance encounter?"
3558,30203forever,Yep. It's much easier to be the sheeple but only in the short run...
3559,throwd444444,"Got a few thoughts on this. 

1. Physical distance (alone time) -> Stands to reason that if you're constantly around other people you will have less clarity of mind. Also if you are too much on your own you will be depressed and unstable. Keep healthy ratios. 

2. Spend your time with people who deserve it. Don't just spend time with people out of obligation or duty. Spend time with people who enrich you or make you feel good. Absolutely avoid AT ALL COSTS being ""shoulder Dave"" for that chick in the office, no matter how hot she might be. This is the worst possible way to spend your time. Getting sucked into some immature crazy little bitches life, only to find yourself betrayed and left high and dry. 

3. Actually have meaningful interests that genuinely do require considerable alone time."

Mankind needs each other to thrive. That's a cold hard fact. Even a recluse has some needs from the outside world, whether it's the cashier at the grocery store or the doctor giving a physical. That doesn't mean we have to be emotionally bonded to someone or adopt the tribe's way of thinking, just that we have to use each other to survive. And, if we want to thrive (not just survive) interaction with people who challenge you to think and do better is really the only way to do that."
