9,ThePanther1989,"Just add a weight room, a walk in humidor, a cellar, and I am set. Keep in mind, if I let a woman move in...those three things would be gone; at the very least, she would demand that I get rid of my weights and the walk in humidor, and try to have her gaggle of girlfriends over constantly to raid the cellar and drink me dry! Trust me, if you move a woman in..she will try it..your peaceful home will be a distant memory! Your life and your peace of mind above any woman! Go your own way!"

25,Sarm11111,"Once i kept my main room/living room nicely decorated by a buddy wife.  I had kept it up and put all my man things in the basement, like a big screen, my desk, pc ,,you get it.  And I’ll admit it  was to have an area that I could entertain women.  Over time and a few shitty relationships I  started asking myself the tough questions and first was do I really want a women moving in or marriage for that.  I have always had a very low trust factor for women. And without going into it the lack of trust stemmed from some very criminal things by women, that no one would believe.  I wasn’t an INCEL, far from it, but after the “experience” I retreated and stopped dating.  And witnessed other warning signs with friends and coworkers .  So I asked those questions, do I really want to have a wife/women in my life to the extent of bring them home or marrying, and the answer was no, hell no.  So I bought a huge screen, cut a hole in the dinning room table to mount a tv in to play games with friends, decorated my walls with dragon heads, swords , and so on.  So now my man cave is my whole house and I vouknr care less what any women would say, because I’ll probably be pushing them out the door to a cab.and I love my childish dungeon."

The compliment should be delivered in a certain tone of voice, given at the appropriate time. etc etc etc.  It's far, far more trouble than it's worth.  

Why jump through all those hoops in an attempt to be nice?  It's so much less trouble and stress to just ignore them and walk away.  I'm so glad I did."

Why do we think they have labeled all MRAs misogynist, all MGTOW as incels and pedophiles? Why did they try to ban the ""Red Pill"" documentary? 

&#x200B;

Show of hands kids, who has the answer? 

&#x200B;

Feminism exist today only as a function of censorship, and that is exactly why they try to paint you guys with that brush, to silence you and redirect from your argument.

&#x200B;

Look, I'm an MRA, but not MGTOW. I'm married, long term (I found a great one from a previous generation- well I may be MGTOW because I did go my own way), but the message is as clear as if it were a written like a flash burnt across the sky, and the only way it can be defended is by calling you ""misogynist"" or some other vile name so as to dismiss you and silence the conversation, keep people from looking up.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately there are too many women out there starting to agree, and as Dr. Smith stated, ""if men are not allowed to speak, I will speak for them"". I had a phone conversation recently with one of the most notable women in the MRM, and even she replied to my comment that ""I don't subscribe to women bashing"" with, ""well, society and women have a lot to account for"".

Feminism is quickly becoming a joke, a cliche', fodder for parody...and this issue is exactly why. The guys comment was fucking brilliant."
98,30203forever,"And by ""family courts"" you mean the ""Divorce tribunals""? Because they're neither ""family"" nor ""courts"", IMHO...."
99,30203forever,"I agree with what you wrote. Personally, I define feminism as the political movement of the sub-par females to leverage their vote in order to get their hands on the resources which they ""deserve"" but are not able or unwilling to get the traditional way (i.e. scamming the males out of their money under the current gynocentric laws). And they're using their phony ""victimhood"" because it helps greatly with that. The ""equality"" which the feminists are constantly harping about is actually the ""equality of outcome"" along the lines of: ""that woman was able to secure a good husband &/or job and  I was not; therefore, it's obvious that the patriarchy is oppressing me and I deserve to be compensated by society for being persecuted."" That's how the feminists really think and that's the very reason why you never argue with them: it's next to impossible to make someone understand something when their income depends on NOT understanding it. IMHO, the equality of outcome (i.e. communism) is not equality at all and I'm talking from personal experience, actually. As Aristotle said 2.5K years ago, ""The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal."" The feminism is evil in its most basic form and must be fought with everything we'we got because if it wins, the men will become the abject slaves, no doubt about it...."

102,DJ-Roukan,"That was pretty brilliant, guy."
103,WildChad,"I have come to the exact same end conclusion that feminism, the way it trends, leads to re-introduction of slavery as it ultimately desires to have the power to arbitrarily call any sexual act a criminal offense whenever it wants - Only dictators are in the same position as the power they have is to command the hand of the law according to their will - In its completion this would reduce men to a slave class while women would be elevated to noble citizenry / master class, just like Ancient Greece and Rome had a slave class of sub-humans who were there to do all the work that could be exploited in any way on the whim of the master class citizens.  


This is the end game agenda, even if not conscious one, of feminism.  
In other words, even if well intended, this is the automatic final state if feminism does not meet enough resistance."
104,DJ-Roukan,"You are not alone my friend. Most people have not heard a great many truths about feminism...because they have become so adept at the lie, have so much power, they can not only censor the movie, but the very fact that they did censor it.  They censor the truth, then they hide the truth, then they hide the fact that they hid the truth.

&#x200B;

Most people that I speak with on line, that still believe that feminism is about equality and not a hate group aimed at men, are so naive of the truth, have so little understanding, that it would take ten posts to bring them up to speed.

106,30203forever,"Yep. The end goal is to enslave the hated bottom 80% ""below average undesirable"" men while using the top 20% as their playthings.

I just wrote a separate post illustrating the dangers of this inspired by this conversation and another one I had yesterday:

110,DJ-Roukan,You bet. Glad to help.
111,30203forever,">Maybe the femanuts try doing one of their ""studies"" on male Humor.

Not going to work because stupid people do not usually understand humor and hate the people who do (usually, the men). That's because the feminists are not only devoid of the sense of humor themselves, jealous of others who have it but are also very suspicious & fearful that people are joking at their expense (which is not entirely untrue...). As far as ""get a life"" goes, that's the core of the issue: they are feminists precisely because they can't get a life and NOT the other way around...."
112,30203forever,"I saw that post an agree with that. In addition, the females want the right to reinterpret consent post-factum and sometimes years or decades after the fact. Case in point: the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. Not only that, they want their claims to be judged to be ""true till proven false"" and not the other way around (i.e. #BelieveAllWomen). In short they want the end of the Due Process but only in one direction because ""reasons"". I have a simple solution to all that mindfuckery, at least on the personal level. Do not engage with any ""regular"" women in the West. Avoid them like the plague they are. To me, they are all the property of the state, their real daddy-husband and I do not mess with the government property.... P.S. You're ""better"" than me because I reported, blocked that person & forgot about it..."
113,DJ-Roukan,"and you are getting smarter every time I read you...

kidding of course, but dead on the money accurate."
114,WildChad,"Oh yeah, I didn't even remember post-factum which is horrible.

In the worst case not only you'd need to record all your sex acts with women, you'd have to store them forever - And when it comes to the current practices of divorce courts, evidence for the man is often completely ignored by the judge - So practically you'd never be safe even with consent.

I think you are completely right about ending Due Process, which is currently in the process of being eroded for women just because vagina.

And yes, avoid all BP women in the West and gauge actively for these belief systems in any women you engage with in order to stay safe."

121,kapatikora,"Banned for stating blatantly that mgtow should pursue interest unrelated to women

122,Cryedra,I got banned for saying leaving someone elses child to rot is immoral.
123,Trek13,"got banned from r/mgtow twice.  Both times for criticizing  ""dear Leader"" (fucking Trump) in response to idiotic posts praising him.  Politics should be on the sidebar as not allowed and I mostly could ignore the Freeper types on that sub but over time the stupidity just got under my skin.   Also, too many ""victims"" there.  Pretty sure I pissed some people off pointing that out.  Sure, things are somewhat stacked against men in our society, especially white men right now, but if you stand back and objectively look at things it is mostly background noise.   I will take being a white male in this society any day, we are NOT oppressed and if you have half a brain it is not hard to compete and succeed.   Thank god I am not saddled from birth with the crutch of ""victimhood"" like women and other groups are.

And I can say as far as ""MGTOW"" as a concept, probably 90+% of of guys on r/mgtow are just not there.   It seems more of an AA for men in pain dealing with redpill truths.    I wish them goodluck in their pursuit of ""mgtow"", its not for everyone thats for sure.   But FFS keep the reich wing political BS out of it. 

 I say this as a 60 year old, never married, no kids, original ""confirmed bachelor"", retired early, financially independent ""loner"".    Lots of women in my past but could never let go of my freedom."

Why yes I did...I've never seen a more pathetic group than that.  Guess they need their safe space."
130,,"I left voluntarily. Too many self-defeatist foreveraloners that are not interested in self development. Not interested in sharing life strategies. Too eager to fall for the clickbait media. I've also been guilty of this in the past. It's very easy to get into the bitter loop concerning feminists. But brandishing all women as having the same agenda is just as stupid as a libtard saying all men are toxic. It serves no purpose. It brings nothing to the quality of your life. MGTOW subreddit in its current state is an echo chamber.

I've seen a conversion from when the incel subreddit got banned. Most of the MGTOWs who shared their wisdom are no longer on the subreddit. A MGTOW I met in London even calls them menimists and refuses to go back on there. A few good posters remain. But they are drowned out by the overwhelming outrage porn.

It's a sinking ship. And that's because visiting the subreddit leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. A hyper focus on the worst of female nature. The worst of society.

Men need male spaces though. Men need brotherhood. Is this subreddit got the markings to provide that? I'm not entirely sure at the moment. However, for me it's time to turn a new leaf. Get back to the original intention of MGTOW. It wasn't to shun yourself away from society. It was to avoid commitment aka marriage and anything that does not serve men on his path. It was to place your hobbies and interests at the forefront. To realise that you're more than just your biological imperative. And I kind of deviate here from most MGTOWs, I don't think hooking up with women is bad if you are smart about it. Essentially the first inception of MGTOWs were the single bachelor types. I think through MGTOW subreddit getting popular. With YouTubers echoing clickbait  like TFM reading out the horror stories of gynocentrism it's become a bastardised version of itself.

Anyways, just my thoughts."
131,,"They'll ban you if they think you're the Chad type.

So much inexperience with those guys on there, as a 34 year old who has been through a lot with women, they became pretty transparent.  Got easy to tell who hadn't been with a girl and who had. "
132,HesperianDragon,Banned in the middle of the night while I slept. Can't think of what made them do this.
133,saaralgris,"Just got banned yesterday, not sure what I said that was so triggering. Never thought I'd say it but that sub is teeming with negativity, it's off my radar moving forward. "
134,Cyanidova,"The comment:

> Society just needs to stop pretending single moms are heroines or some sort of bullshit superwomen.

> Women are extremely superficial herd animals.  Bring shame back and they'll be back in line.

My reply

> What about men who have cheated and left women, or widowers

Only comment there. Got banned within minutes"
135,whyamiotaku565,Oh you mean mgtow who are open-minded and not anrgy red pilled divorcées 
136,mcsimeon,I got downvoted to hell just for questioning why they would actively avoid women 24/7. Seems a bit like the old Braincells subreddit. 
137,Liquid_Leopard,"Well, I always wondered what you had to get banned from /MGTOW and I found out! Apparently, well thought out answers and trying to have an adult conversation with mildly differing opinions is all it takes. "
138,yermanbob,"Just unsubbed at the same time as getting banned, apparently you can't ask why an idiot 20 year old got banned, I started to talk about the purity spiral and the creation of there own bubble vs free speech that I've seen kill many communities since athieism+

I predicted that sub will be going down within 18 months because they have lost focus on the welfare of men instead preferring to have a bitch fest at women. "
139,xpillx,"I just got banned from mgtow lol. They turned into a fucking hatred incel group. The amount of man jumping on high horse and virtue signaling there is astounding. I dont know a reason why I got banned. I had many good convos there but I guess ban was for 1 comment in thread where guy was virtue signaling to others about not wanting to fuck that chick he posted that actually looked amazing to me. I suggested that he hates looks too much and maybe he likes a dick in a butt. These guys turn into sjw feminazi that try to control freedom of speech. I dunno maybe they will make safety rooms for those incels soon too. There is a difference in not liking some women behavior and just her looks...
"
140,ArtDeve,I am relieved I finally got banned. /r/MGTOW is full of toxic and hypocritical incels.
141,NYLON_G,"I challenged a so called MGTOW on his slut shaming of an Asian female. I asked the question why he was so concerned about something he had no choice over and no control over.

His response was to launch into a personal tirade about doing whatever he wanted to do. He then attacked me personally and to top it off resorted to racial attacks. This from a MGTOW who has never met me and doesn't know anything about me.

I am convinced that r/MGTOW has been feminised and corrupted by feminists and anti-MGTOW shills. To be banned from the subreddit for having a discussion about MGTOW while the racist idiot sits in there doesn't surprise me. The fact that a text if admin would take sides with a racist does surprise me.

Race has nothing to do with MGTOW. However on racist Reddit subredfits this is not only permissible. It is supported and it is promoted. I will not be going back into that subreddit even as a lurker. It has become a hive of scum and villainy."
142,TimJohnsonIII,Got banned. No explanation. No reply when I questioned.
143,,"Yes. I did. I've also been banned from r/IncelTears and r/TrueFemcels. I was going to give r/feminism a shot, but I absolutely refuse to visit that sub under any circumstances. 

You either hate the targeted gender of those subs or get out. Reason and neutrality are not welcome. 

Honestly, I'm convinced incels have taken over r/MGTOW. They're just so hateful and miserable over there. It's depressing. Do you know not one of those men have posted anything to honor Father's Day? They're so busy hating women they forgot to show all the dads out there love today.

HAPPY FATHER'S DAY TO ALL OF THE GOOD FATHERS OUT THERE!

I didn't have mine, so I admire those who love and care for their children."
144,Oldschool085,"I got banned for jokingly saying ""who hurt you"". "
145,Milk_moustache,"Haha brilliant. I was banned for saying they over implied a negative relationship from a single photo. A man sat on a train with a bit of a somber look, that’s just the London look mate. 

These boys are salty "
146,delukard,"That sub is infested with looser that got cucked and now are crying.

99% of them are beta."
147,Bastard-of-the-North,Got banned for telling someone who questioned why the whole sub was hating on captain marvel that the sub is basically incels 2.0 and referring him here 
148,Membrudo,I think the mod's girlfriend hijacked his account.
149,DJDickJob,"If you haven't already been banned, just leave anyway. Fuck that sub. It belongs to the incels now. "
150,TheMasp,got banned  from posting because i asked why we have to be so angry/hating of women lol. I mean i know we are different and MGTOW/Redpill is about that. But we should i feel be working more for Mens benifit and our growth then venting and angry with women.
151,,What’s happening with the ppl being banned so much? Who’s running the MGTOW? It seems the ppl who are being banned are more MGTOW than not. I was just banned yesterday for no good reason
152,13Heathens,"Apparently, this warranted a ban:
  
""True love exists, but it's super rare in our generation.

I know these older couple, pretty well off and retired at about 50? The dude fell sick and was hospitalized, they had the option to discontinue treatment as it seemed hopeless (and was expensive as hell). I would've pulled the plug tbh but the lady did everything she could to treat him; risking their retirement plans.

Thankfully, he didn't have to go through the full course of expensive treatments and they're now enjoy their golden years.

I found out that they were each other's firsts and both worked hard together to earn their wealth. Guy's not a chad too.""
  
Some guy responded with ""Go. Away.""
  
""Not sure why you're so hostile. If you disagree with me, we can have a proper discussion.

Think of it this way.

Getting a unicorn is like winning a lottery. It's so rare that you might as well treat it as non-existent.

But are there lottery winners? Yes.

Should I spend a lot of resources in trying to win the lottery? No.

But the fact remains that there are lottery winners.""
  
Same guy responded with ""Wrong.""
  
I reported the last one for low effort and got the banned message shortly."
153,lord_dark_hobnob,"Subscriber for two years.

No explanation from mods.

Don't need r/mgtow to go my own way."
154,steelyknife1122,"Aaaaaand banned. Never offended any member. Bashed women like I was supposed to do. Wonder what kind of interesting posts from other banned or shadow banned users I could never read.

The mods are probably 40yo, red-haired women who have hit the wall and chain smoke cigarettes inside their apartments while watching reruns of desperate housewives."
155,,This guy was saying OP’s dead brother (who had committed suicide) was a failure so I called him out and got banned when he told me to fuck off and I replied that he should fuck his anime pillow. Is MGTOW full of furries and anime queers?
156,sikki_nixx,Lol I said MGTOW2 is a fantastic subreddit and got banned from MGTOW...lol
157,lordlahmacun,"I wasn't banned. I left myself. r/MGTOW sadly turned away from a supportive group for men who don't want commitments into a nightmare fuel of incels and alike. I am so disgusted with myself for actually falling for their misogynistic trap for months... 

Well, i guess that's just another dialectic. My life prior to MGTOW was antithesis and MGTOW was thesis. Now it's time for synthesis."
158,TigPlaze,A friend from MGTOW PMed me about having just gotten banned.  They gave him no reason why.  I made a post asking how someone can contest a ban in the event of a mistake.  My post vanished immediately.  This makes me think they have no interest in running MGTOW with integrity.  I invited him here to MGTOW2.
159,Implausible-asset,"Yes I got banned from r/mgtow for ""concern trolling"" on my old account. Nearly all the karma I had was from upvotes in that sub, but they banned me anyways. 

Yeah sorry no sorry, but when someone is complaining about not getting laid and is saying they're going to buy a gun and let fate decide, then yeah I'd say concern is warranted. 

I'm hopeful that here I can see the good posts on how mgtow helps men be better at being themselves, keeps them out of the trap of the marriage contract, and provides cautionary tales based on our own learning experiences with women. 

And mods for inevitable showing of the incels here, please hand out the bans like candy. Those fools are subreddit cancer."
160,Tsukikoselenia,"Been banned because.. I have absolutely no idea, honestly. Not even incel-bashing, defending women, or anything like that (it really isn't my type), just a sudden ban out of nowhere, maybe because of a talk with a guy about how improvement is important but saying that hard work will always work is false, since this guy's posts got deleted? Who knows. 

For a sub that wants to reach the 100k ans is so proud of it, randomly banning people doesn't exactly sound like a smart idea."
161,,[deleted]
162,Yasai101,"Well, I suppose Ill bring myself over to this sub after getting banned for some random comment.  After reading some 2d waifu BS and other simping shit I dared to point it out and got banned. Hope to see some good content here. Cheers."
163,kiryat,"I got banned and I vaguely remember a comment I said that might have gotten me banned.

The post was saying something along the lines of: ""Society should not support single moms choices, instead society should penalize and ostracize them"".

My comment was saying something along the lines of: ""I agree that society should not support single moms choices, but I'm not sure if penalizing and ostracizing them is helpful"".

Bam, banned!

Nuance is lost on the admin of r/MGTOW"
164,nuka-cola-girl,Got banned for saying 'Great post! Have you tried r/MGTOW2 ?' on a rare post that was actually about a man going his own way. 
165,,Got banned for calling them out on their soyboy humor
166,DisappointingSnugg,"I didn’t get banned,but I saw the direction it was going. "
167,BludgeonVIII,"Ah shiet the sad thing is that there are still uplifting posts about people doing cool things with their lives after going their own way, and I want to support that stuff.

But then I find myself getting caught up in some sketchy shit that I lowkey regret commenting about or even just looking at. 

Fuck man. I dunno how to feel now. "
168,mentalidade_logica,"I got banned too, why? No idea!

Unsubscribed."
169,,I was banned after clearly pointing out that most of the guys on /r/mgtow sound like my catty hairdresser (the women-hating kind)
170,DJCheeky,"Shadowbanned for pointing out that a poster had fabricated an AITA thread to make a wife look like they hated their husband having friends, when in reality the husband's friend was being an asshole. Here we go self-reinforcing beliefs!"
171,theanchorman05,"Got banned about a hour ago.  I responded to a post where the guy was talking about women starting drama at work.  I proceed to tell him to move on and women talk smack about each other a lot and this dude proceeds to ask me if I'm slow.  I respond that obviously he hasn't moved on if he made a 8 paragraph story about the entire thing.  

&#x200B;

That was why I was banned. Not even a feminist sub would've banned me for that. I'm guessing the guy I responded to was a mod, oh well."
172,bluepepino,I got banned from r/feminism and r/mgtow .. go figure. lol
173,goodboy12,I got banned because I made fun of a shit meme. All I said was a 13 year old would think this is corny 😂
174,jp_mra,"Got banned by defending a well known anti-feminist, because the anti-feminist was female. Go figure.  


r/MGTOW is honestly more toxic than r/Feminism"
175,dJ_86,Banned for saying I was bi sexual
176,mgtowthrowaway255,"Got banned and was not even given a reason.

&#x200B;

Shows you everything you need to know about them. Those aren't true MGTOW and if they are that cowardly on the internet, you have to wonder how bad they are in real life. That's also why that subreddit attracts the lowest quality posters, who mostly seem to want to brag that they have money and women chase them now, which is ridiculous. If you want to attract women that's the opposite of MGTOW."
177,A_G_H_D,"Just got banned for trying to talk about what users think the MGTOW subreddit should be for. I guess that comes under the heading of ""concern trolling""? IDK. IDC. What I do know is , r/MGTOW is definitely not the place to talk about it."
178,ksimbobbery,Banned for calling them out on being worse than incels lol. Like banning me is going to do literally anything.
179,Sly21C,"I was banned, no reason given whatsoever. What's going on? I've been a brilliant participant AFAIK. Oh wait, except for one comment where I said I'm not a fan of TRP at all, that I thought MGTOW was better. "
180,russpav,"This is the comment that got me banned 2 months ago. When they banned me I realized they did me a favor. 

“I’m glad others are seeing this trend and speaking up as well. I first subscribed to MGTOW because there were good articles about self improvement and building better habits. The trend seems more and more externally focused and less and less about self improvement.

Repressing others (individuals or groups) does not free my mind, it traps it in a negative feedback loop of anger, fear and resentment. All of which I want to let go of and put down.”"
181,,I just got banned 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

Yup, and guess what -- you guys are here, too.  Not a surprise."
184,raja-ulat,I got banned after posting a picture posted on a separate subreddit. It was about a mother who had an armless child and emotionally abused him to the point he decided to commit suicide.
185,AffectionateCamera,"I got banned some time ago for asking a question about what French ""yellow jacket"" protests have to do with MGTOW.

187,purge1,"Just happened to me, honestly I just thought to look up MGTOW on reddit and found out the MGTOW sub is filled with women hating incels. The thread was the guy talking on Facebook with a girl about that the dogs are better than women, because dog won't divorce you and dog won't take your kids, and asked her what is the womens argument and she said vagina, he was like ""mhm, ok, what else?"". And one of responses there was ""vaginas stink anywhere, I don't need your disgusting hole"" or something, so I responded ""is this sub just riddled with incels?"" And they proved me right, by banning me. Is that really what MGTOW is about?"
188,,Got banned and 12 hours without a reply as to why I was banned. My post was about my concern about MGTOW community that I've heard from the YouTuber Angry MGTOW. Apparently angry incels got ahold of being mods there.

I deleted my reddit because I was addicted and now 2 years of lurking has me making an account again because: I finally came out to myself as bisexual after 13 years of living in denial. I reckon they banned me based solely on my other subreddits. I even asked for clarification and got no reply!  hahaha

200,,"Just saw their latest post complaining about the double standard applied to angry white men vs raging females.

The moderators are not replying to my reply to their 'ban message' (although they said ""reply to this message to get an explanation for your ban"") ... so, it appears the mods on r/MGTOW are not doing their job in a timely fashion, or they are corrupt. I'll miss that sub, but there is r/MGTOW2 and other forums on the internet to mingle with like-minded cats such as yourselves from time to time. You won't hear from me much, but I'll sure enjoy your company if you don't mind me hanging around..."

203,Pimozv,"I was banned.  I don't see why.  I asked the mods twice and received no answer.

Believe it or not, I remember when this sub use to be a place of discussion, a place where men turned to - to better themselves on their new found path, a place where men have chosen to go their own way to rectify what’s been torn apart do to the aftermath’s of failed marriages and relationships. Now almost all of that helpful knowledge and sound advice is being clouded by articles and rants that reflect misogyny, and at times, pure black pilled hatred. 

I understand that a lot of us come to this sub with red pill rage and need that outlet, but that rage will be the very death of this sub. Downvote this into oblivion for all I care, but I know there are men here who feel the same, if they haven’t already moved on.

[Just out of curiosity, can’t this be applied to males as well? A lot of my mates are pretty promiscuous dudes and have had plenty of one night stands. So with this logic, are they no different from the women this excerpt aims to shame? 

Not trying to ruffle feathers, just kinda curious on the stance about men that do the things MGTOW hate about women (cheating, sleeping around, using another person for any kind of temporary/ personal gain, etc.). I try not to keep dudes like that in my friend circle anymore,  I can certainly say I’ve seen a lot of men do these things that women are so demonized for.  I’ve certainly been fucked over by the opposite sex, but a lot of my mates have done the same to some genuinely nice women. 

As a single male, I wonder about the MGTOW movement and if it is too extreme of an ideology for me. Don’t mind the GMOW part, since that is the life I tend to lean towards as an introvert, but I love my mother, and sisters, and have met genuinely kind women.]


Hopefully some of you in this sub can answer this without me being banned first. I’m looking for camaraderie with people who aren’t so relationship focused and driven by the need for someone else in their life to make them happy, but MGTOW might be too extreme or me."

I  am one of those dude who thinks we men are not that oppressed as the  MGTOW subreddit or redpill portay. I agree some part of the relationship  issue. Where some men are treated unfairly. Other than that the  subreddit is full of negative generalizing of feminist, liberals, mass  media etc.

254,rationalthought314,This wouldn't be necessary any more than MGTOW itself if not for the current situation we find ourselves in. Men would not be bitching here about the MGTOW subreddit if not for the shitty arbitrary behavior of the current mods over there while many men would not be going mgtow if not for the shitty behavior of many women and the overall system that is highly unfair.
255,Memekip,"Yep 

I'm all for male independence, but I feel that constantly going around in a circlejerk of hating women just proves that the people who hang out there are clearly not over it. Being one sided and keeping an eye out for only bad women which fit the narritive in your head is just asking to get into a toxic mindset imo: vicareously playing the victim of a minority of women who play the victim to take advantage of men

It's a subreddit about independent men that discusses women 90% of the time. Which is kind of the opposite of the sub's title"

264,thoughtpixie,"I got banned for...
Well idk, either because I’m a chick or because I genuinely was trying to understand their logic- or both.. probably both.

I had pointed out that I was gaslighted by my ex boyfriend and somehow found myself at 19 years old paying all the rent, all the groceries, and meanwhile my ex boyfriend five years older than me- lying, cheating, and spending his money on a new bong or Xanax addiction- I was trying to point out that it wasn’t because he’s a man that he’s a shitty manipulative person.. 

I’m all for men feeling empowered without women.. but I found myself at mgtow because just like with “man haters”, neither gender should be held accountable for the world’s problems, or an individual’s problems.. and I was wondering what kind of logic they use since it does seem they blame women for all the world’s problems. 

I’d argue a lot of women’s problems are culturally pushed on women by other women, and same with men. 

And also, I have more male friends than female friends... like the two genders aren’t strictly romance based... but mgtow makes it out to be just a biological reproductive thing between the genders.. platonic relationships are important."

No reply from the mods, so I’ve decided I am going to keep messaging them until I get a response. I don’t want back in, if anything this is a blessing, but just want an explanation.

What I am trying to say is a lot of these issues are to do with partners not matching ( ugly or ugly etc) and the capitalist system which is destroying the environmental and sociological spheres of life. We need to truly look at what we NEED in life not what we want. Because right now basic needs are not being met by 60% of the population. We are all connected and have the ability as a species to inflict pain on someone else emotionally and even subconsciously.

293,In_This_Here_Economy,"MGTOW went to shit for the exact same reason feminism did: the reactionary, fringe elements have become the leading voices of the movement.  I don't share the beef with feminism that a lot of MGTOW men believe that they have to have.  I know and understand that feminism, at it's core, is just as much about dismantling gender roles for men as it is women.  If I am to be honest, it was actual feminism that taught me self respect as a man and why I was compelled to a lot of the behaviors and concepts of myself, women and the world that I had, and that reason is patriarchy.  The same men who brag about how it's been primarily men who've created civilizations and governments are the same ones who deny the existence of patriarchy unironically and under the spell of cognitive dissonance.

It's ridiculous, actually.  

The most important thing, I think, for a man to remember is that he doesn't have to hate women to recognize and respect himself as a human being, and he doesn't have to hate himself to recognize and respect the humanity of women."

I've been banned from dozens of subreddits, especially LGBTs, feminists, cuckoldery fetishists, adulteries, affair advices, cheating experiences, and I'm cool with getting banned from there, because they are my ""enemy"" territory, getting banned from there is EXPECTED. 
but when i got banned from mgtow? hell no, i wasn't expecting that. i was a men's right activist and a mgtow commentator at the time, and i always considered manosphere my FRIENDLY territory (except PUA and Incels, we don't share much in common) but i never expected a BAN from mgtow. 
the problem is, they won't tell you WHY they banned you and they'll never give you a SECOND chance ever again.
so if the moderators don't want to give a fuck about banned members, why should banned members give a fuck about them? 
and again, they're NOT the OFFICIAL mgtow, as they have confessed it themselves in subreddit. 

but after that, i can't trust any FRIENDLY territory anymore.

Basically the synopsis said the woman got away with the crime, she was released no charges.  But the article said she was re arrested, charged with multiple crimes, and was undergoing a psych evaluation.

Proof positive that the narrative is the most important thing there and not any form of truth.  Sounds like /r/politics."

334,Implausible-asset,"I can tell you why I avoid women 24/7. Speaking only for myself:

1. Marriage is a raw deal for men. Everyone knows this. I dont want to subject myself to that kind of slavery.

2. Dating and girlfriends: Every girlfriend I've had has either cheated on me with someone who had more money or a better position in life. Monkey branching. I dont fault them for it now, it's just their nature. And I dont enjoy the feeling of a breakup when I was thinking everything was ok. Casual dating equates to more buying free dinners than romantic reward, and it's expensive I'd rather use those resources on my self. Also the breakup psycho factor. Consensual sex and turn into a rape claim that without any investigation at all can ruin your life. No thank you 

3. Women in the workplace: I am 100% professional all the time, and make sure I'm never alone with one. A false claim to HR about touching her butt or her being offended by a joke  can have you out on your ass faster than 5pm comes on a holiday weekend. It's not worth the risk.

4. Day to day life: they only talk to you if they want something from you. And I dont want to give them anything. I want to do what I want to do. 

Staying away from women keeps me focused, energized, and moving forward. It's the way I mgtow, and mgtow is freedom. "

337,-Ecliptic-,anything besides hardcore female hate will get you banned sooner or later.
338,Yasai101,I agree
339,xpillx,"Ohhh I think I know why I got banned from reading mgtow vs mgtow2 topic. There was a thread some mgtow made and he posted a sexbot and said he would rather fuck that than a real woman. I was instantly wronged about it. I said something like:
""I dunno man... stuff like that creeps me out. Id rather fuck my hand watching porn or fuck a real woman (escort or maybe relationship but no marriage).""

I think thats healthy mindset and my preferance. Seems like those sweaty losers got triggered and banned me lmao."
340,jasonmiles2014,It is really incredible the vitriol being spouted there.  Failing to adhere strictly to their holier than thou philosophies will lead to you being called every name imaginable.  
341,Yasai101,"hah ""dick in a butt,"" he got served."

344,squiddy_s550gt,I got heavily downvotesd for the same thing on my previous alt
345,,That's the issue. Anything to fit the narrative that women are evil. How is that any different than what a feminist does to men. 
346,rw032697,"Exactly, occasionally I would comment ""w-who hurt you?"" like seriously just a bunch of people getting betrayed or dumped or rejected. "
347,Jmick1090,"Well just got banned today. Here is the post the got me banned.

348,Impossible-asset,"The mods are more sympathetic towards the angry Male/woman blaming crowd than the men who are trying to apply gyow philosophical and lifestyle ideas. 

So when someone says anything that isnt in line with that narrative, the OP or commenter is reported and banned. 

It's unfortunate to see it go in that direction, because it makes it annoying to sort through 50 posts of bullshit to find one good solid post about mgtow."
349,choosey-lover,Mods wake up in the morning and decide to choose hate instead of love. Everyone makes this choice themselves every day.
350,rinrits,"Seriously, I never posted anything more than some lame jokes, always within context, and I was still banned, no reason given; apparently all it takes is a whim for the shake of the hammer to take hold"

I talked sense. Bashed the trolls and I’m the one who’s banned.

357,sikki_nixx,Yes
358,mgtowthrowaway255,"Yeah I got banned that way too. I asked the mods and they never replied.

Honestly it's not MGTOW. It's either run by simps or wimps, or by women that are purposely messing with men."
359,30203forever,"Look at their 10 ""rules"". They are perfectly within their rights to ban anyone for any reason or no reason at all. It might have worked for a while (and it have) but eventually, the busybodies or people with some really nefarious agenda can (and did) become moderators there.  The real question is ""Why would anyone want to be a member of such club?"""

374,Uncle_Vodka_237,"I remember your posts there DrivZone, I was up voting you for them and I support your opinion.

I just got banned for posting in the same place. I'm not sure for what, but I'm guessing it was my post where I stated ""I see no good reason for hating women"" (in the sense that it's a waste of time/energy). Probably seen as white knighting/virtue signalling or some bullshit."

382,Impossible-asset,Cognitive dissonance: don't think one can be mgtow and be married. Pretty sure that puts you into MRA territory. I mean the whole premise of mgtow is men not getting married and exposing themselves to the inherent liabilities of it all.

385,ArmondDillo,"Those cunts use a lot of shady tricks, they were fucking with me for weeks before i finally got outright banned. That fag /u/ss_camaro literally bans people if they're getting too many points, because he gets jealous. Also they didn't like me using the term ""roast beef whore."" They must, themselves, be sons of roast beef whores."
386,In_This_Here_Economy,This.
387,Loban8990,"Something I've been afraid of for the last year or so is MGTOW becoming an echo chamber. There was a time when the sub wasn't so vitriolic. We would share ideas, and hobbies and give advice. I've been a member there since 2014 (this in an alt account). I remember those days."
388,-Entilzha_Valen-,"I'm too the point I think they ban for pretty much any post that gets reported.  So if you cause anyone butthurt and they report you, you get banned."
389,ksimbobbery,Literally worse than incels
390,yermanbob,"It occurs to me that both females and males, of all the flavours of pills, make these sorts of judgements based on their favourite celebrity of the moment.

To me it seams strange basing such a broad opinion on an extremely small evidence base of rich people.

Surely it would be easier to accept that normal people age in different ways, it's mostly dependent on lifestyle choice. Or am I missing something? While genes do play a role I'd argue that money /epigenetics is a far stronger contribution to change.

Perhaps I've had one to many beers?"
391,Dharmathinker,"I agree. Even if there is some things to criticize about modern day women. It does no good at all to spend so much energy and time hating on them.  The idea of mgtow was clearly to focus on self development. and alot of them completely miss that.  

And god for bid you bring up the idea of talking about other things and not women.  Theyll call you names and just defend them selves"
392,30203forever,"All their rules are bullshit and custom-made to be able to ban anyone for any reason or no reason at all. It appears to me though that they especially hate the MGTOW who are out of the red pill rage. No serious discussions allowed, methinks. But hey, I haven't been there for half a year since I got banned and not going back because that sub is as good as gone..."
393,FlourishedCass,I did the same thing. They really didn't like that.

395,FlourishedCass,Mad preacher lad by any chance?
396,NathanHollister,"In all fairness, it's easy to spread. Just drop redpills on your friends and family. And feminism redpills more men every day as they expand the welfare state and make the laws against men worse (TFM mentioned a woman who got away with stabbing a man, and another who got only 15 months in prison for being complicit in a man's death).

Conversely, having kids just makes one more future feminist. Because odds are good you lose the kid to a feminist wench, or the public school indoctrinates your kid, or college indoctrinates him. Kids are fine, as long as you adopt and homeschool him. Otherwise, he's probably fucked no matter how redpill you are"
397,Implausible-asset,"That's easy. Just apply mgtow philosophy to yourself when other men see you succeeding in life while they are struggling, theyll ask, and you tell them how. 

It's easy as that. Men know when something isnt working, but they do need to be able to see a logical, clear path out. And that is what mgtow is."
398,Uncle_Vodka_237,"Yep, It will be interesting to see what happens to that sub over time."
399,Tsukikoselenia,"Seems like a common pattern here. It's probably what happens when you go against what a mod thinks when he's in a bad day despite not having broken any rule. 

Which is kind of weird because you don't even have to defend women for this to happen; sometimes he's just triggered by what you were saying and seems to havethe self-control of a child."
400,BoskOfPortKar,WTF
401,AcrobaticAge,"What??? You were one of the few insightful guys there.

I better be prepared to be banned, since I have been openly vocal about how I don't like that sub getting ridden by incels."
402,redditicantrecall,that doesn't make sense considering all the unique profile names that are on there
403,BluetoothMcGee,Username (and subsequent projection) checks out.
404,XFinalPhantom,"Same, at one point, almost made me feel like I wasn’t Mgtow. But then I realized that it’s moderators who are assholes. Mgtow is a great train of thought, but we look no better than feminists. Sometimes I feel like they want women dead just like feminists want men dead. It’s toxic, I feel that not all women are bad, but marriage and relationships never worked to begin with. It’s society hoping for something to be true when it’s not in human nature."
405,Uncle_Vodka_237,"Man, I'll tell ya. Reading that shit makes me so fucking glad I've given up on relationships.

> I hate myself, I hate this, I hate how complicated relationships are.

I agree with you when you say both genders are susceptible to having relationship doubts. Those incels only want to see it one way. All women are cancer etc..."
406,DatingTank,"Lol, it was that same post that spiraled me to a ban. I just can't shut up when something is clearly fake or wrong, but people keep using it to confirm a narrative. It's exactly the same that the worst SJWs are known for. It's a shame they're not holding it to a higher standard in there. It's becoming increasingly toxic."
407,DJDickJob,"It really is a shame, that sub used to be awesome. I learned a lot from that place and felt like sharing my own stories might help younger guys gain some insight, but I got banned for agreeing with someone that said MGTOW1 had started to seem sexist. I added that I think it's because a lot of incels have come here, and got immediately banned. I had been active on there for like 1.5 years and never had any problems. There's a special place in internet hell for all these bitch ass corrupt mods and admins."

409,ButterfingersBiden,"It's not illegal to tip off the authorities their info just saying

410,MParry6,Pretty much what I got banner for. IG related post saying men are bad on it too.
411,Impossible-asset,Why am I not surprised at all to that nonsense on mgtow. Has nothing to do with  mgtow at all.
412,Impossible-asset,"I'll leave it up because:
1. If that's what you did to get banned from the mgtow sub, then that's what you did.
2. Please do not repeat that sort of behavior here.this is not a sub to engage in inflammatory commentary on
 Thank you."
413,ksimbobbery,"That just makes you a bad, hateful person"
414,MParry6,"It used to be about literally checking out and gong your own way. Now, with over 100k subs, it’s become some sort of mutated top trumps, women are pure scum zone that is so full of negativity and anger, it doesn’t help anything.

If you want to kill something, make it popular."
415,Impossible-asset,"Welcome to mgtow. The 2 is incidental...

It's not a movement, it's a sub where we try and foster active conversation amongst men who are going there own way. 

The mods spend a *slight* bit of time trying to curate it constantly so it stays focused on the positive. 

For the bad stuff if it gets through, that report button and the good old downvote button used properly is a big help. 

Enjoy it here and hope to read your good contributions."
416,Booksarepricey,A lot of it is just human nature. The negatives of it get lumped in as descriptors of the groups of people we don't like. It's incredibly polarizing.
417,,"Yeah. Those guys are getting unstable with every passing day. There was a post for people to talk about their difficult childhoods on that sub. Guess what? Those motherfuckers had to come and ruin that. A particular asshat called me my father's bitch cuz my father treated me like shit and said I'd go back kissing his ass when I need him.

What a toxic shitshow of a sub. I just replied to the bastard and reported his comments. There are too many assholes who hide behind their devices and talk shit on the sub.

I'm thinking of unsubbing from that crapwaste."
418,theanchorman05,Whoever the mods are have some power issues.  I hope they're not cops in real life.....
419,Impossible-asset,Thank you for being respectful of the sub rules. And Welcome to mgtow (the 2 is incidental).
420,Bl00_Berry,I don't even know why exactly I got banned but I know the comment had the word in incel in it(I know I wasn't name-calling because I wanted discussion not discourse) like an hour later..... BANNED!!

425,Implausible-asset,"I get it why they discuss women. Keyword being discuss. 
You have talk about what women do and their behaviors and how it affected you. It's good, its healthy. And it helps other men who may be stuck in similar situations find their way out of it. 

But what they do over there now is just bash bash bash women all the time but they dont offer solutions, advice, or success stories. "
426,-Ecliptic-,"I got banned for pointing out they are the flipside of the SJW coin.  They were bitching about Captain Marvel being to SJW because of female lead...

The time before that banned for pointing out they hate Game of Thrones because it has a few strong female characters.

It's hilarious how they bitch about the stereotype and then work so damned hard to live down to it."
427,glitchyjoe64,When you become actual meninists 
428,SleepyMethHead,"Just like you opened yourself to be hurt by that man... us men do the same thing with women. We just do it for different reasons. 

But like in any sub reddit you’ll likely get banned if your going against the sentiment within that bubble of thought.

I agree platonic relationships are important, but they are hard to sustain. Friends I have that are girls disappear when they get into relationships 9/10 times and I hate when they breakup and want to be my friend again. But yes I enjoy female friends."
429,nbjmcclellan,"Next time try pm’ing some user you see posting, MGTOW isn’t women friendly because it is men going their own way, not everyone going there own way. But if you’d like to pm me and ask about it feel free, I’m an avid humanitarian and a huge fan of almost all of what MGTOW stands for."
430,BluetoothMcGee,"You wanna know why you were banned? It's because it's blatantly obvious that you didn't read [anything from](https://archive.fo/wCyUm) [the sidebar](https://archive.is/xPOqz) or the rules of the subreddit and instead chose to be yet another one of our run-of-the-mill trolls who does exactly what we expected: start drama and conflict masquerading as a ""debate"", and when called out, proceed to shame, project, and gaslight. You weren't ""genuinely"" trying to understand us. At all. No one bought your BS. And of course you're here portraying yourself as the victim of the banning that you yourself have initiated. It's almost like clockwork.

And you wonder why we pledged to stay away from your gender as far as possible."
431,,"Originally MGTOW was more of a safe haven for men who have given up on women/traditional relationships. We dedicate the remainder of our lives to self satisfaction. I have no problems getting girls/laid/relationships, I'm just no longer intrested. 

Now the Incels (those who simply cannot get laid for the life of them) start claiming to be MGTOW, and spewing toxic female hate comments, have really ruined the face of the community. 

MGTOW2 is very humble and less interested in bashing women. I am open to discuss female nature, tactics, AWALT, but I don't hate them for being what they are. Its about us, not them. 

I was banned for my comments in MGTOW and really dont care. This sub is the true face of rhw community, and represents what it stands for. "
432,Talkytalktalk,"globalist coq, u mean.  too many globalist libertarians stinkin up mgtow.  mgtow is politically diverse, as long as you're a globalist libertarian."
433,Impossible-asset,Mgtow is normal. Its self-preservation. That's how its grown like it has. Lots of guys just doing what they need to survive.
434,Trek13,"your history and mine are pretty much the same.   Was on r/mgtow from around 20K users to around 100K.   When they banned me (the second time) I pretty much knew why.  Didn't ask why, just sent them a ""thank you"" note.   Needed the clean break from too much toxic negative shit."
435,Impossible-asset,Follow your own example and leave out the angry politics please. Thank you.
436,-Entilzha_Valen-,"If you claim to be MGTOW and are voting democrat, that may be the most blatant case of voting against your own interests ever.  Considering it’s the Democrats who keep passing all these laws that shit on men and ALWAYS support women over men, facts be damned.

EDIT:  The Republicans, may not go out of their way to help men, but at least the aren’t actively hostile to us."
437,vsamarda,"I'm not mgtow, but I just find it strange how so many people on a sub that's all about going your own way and not focusing on relationships spend their entire time hating women and calling them names and focusing on their hate instead of bettering themselves."

442,ksimbobbery,Go through the top posts of MGTOW its all sexist “all women are the same” garbage that you would expect to hear from braincels
443,ElMatador_33,I think I got banned for telling someone they might be gay. I was only half-joking. They really hate LGBTQXYZ

449,BoskOfPortKar,You were criticizing Vilar's work or a female on the post ?
450,Spike-Ball,"Thank you for this. I was really interested in MGTOW at first, until I spent some time on the sub Reddit and saw by far mostly posts that focused on hating women. Hating women makes them just as bad as the extreme feminists that hate men. The existence of one justifies the other, and perpetuates it.

I thought it was great to see posts showing a member enjoying their life and doing something fun, until they make additional effort just to hate on women within the same post. And of course they ban anyone that criticizes or calls out their bullshit."
451,Impossible-asset,"We do not ban users lightly. Obvious and repeated trolling, calls for violence, spam, and bots, yeah that'll catch a ban.  

I spend a lot of time removing posts that dont meet sidebar rules (please everyone read and follow them), and sometimes it's a judgement call on my part. 

But using bans as a downvote button? No."
452,ksimbobbery,MGTOW is just a bunch of angry incels now though
453,throwawayapparently9,did you remove that post? i searched your post history and i couldn't find it.

456,throwawayapparently9,"to be honest, as a former mgtow user (got banned of course) I'm still a little misogynistic. not in the way you think, i don't want to cleanse the earth from women, no. but take a look at my posts history to see how many bad women are out there. 
i just can't look at women the same way i used to look before becoming red pilled.
it's just not worth the risk for me."

However, the occasional angry post amongst red pill knowledge posts and men's rights issues, seasoned with links to some amazing MGTOW channels is far from that. 

If we take huMAN as an example, he is calm most of the time so the rare anger-jerks undermined with cusses are really impactful and memorable. "

Honestly, a lot of the things posted there would cause those men to get fired if their employers saw it. That would explain why they ban people who make sense.

MGTOW is married to the idea that you'll be happier without solipsistic women in it. But you become self-serving solipsistic yourself. You also become utterly miserable without fulfilling your biological imperative. It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons. 

Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men. So what's the difference? Because all I see is men like this too. Especially MGTOW men who aren't interested in building community. I spent a year trying to build a community around MGTOW with users and they were never interested. All they want to do is moan about women all day. 

MGTOW doesn't make you happy. Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving. Society as an whole has become too big. Where as men and women would thrive in smaller communities. There are too many issues just to blame it all on women. And as society increases so does its lack of empathy and the feeling you are just a number. So better to build small communities.

I do not agree with that and feminism is actually damaging woman on the long road. Just as men are *better* in natural fields, woman have insticts and operate on levels unimaginable for men. Man can be Simping for years and could not see it but woman will notice the shit much more quickly. You can lie a woman for a year but to a man awhole life. They have *antennas* or special instincts (mother instincts) that cannot be accessed by pure logic and intellect.

567,,">The idea of MGTOW isn't about building a community. 

The fact that it's a community based subreddit that states to its members that it's nothing to do with community goes to show you that it is utterly self-serving. How is that any different than any woman or man you meet today in society?

MGTOW just plays into the narcissistic division segregationist society. It literally says, ""Okay society, you win! Now let me get my fill"" and instead becomes exactly what nihilist society wants in a MGTOW's own image. 

How did I draw that conclusion? That chase of career. The chase for material. Elliot Hulse said it better that ""I'm with you MGTOW but you focus too much on the matter. The mother world. The material.""

And I believe he is right to some extent. There's no harm in bettering your career but if that's all you do and all you aspire it material, what is your legacy? 

>Being self-serving doesn't mean I'm harming anyone else in the process

Not at all but its essentially why societies collapse. It's a communist-like mindset. And as the population grows into self-serving narcissism so does the utter disdain and divide amongst people. 

>MGTOW has made me happier than I've ever been, so I don't know what you mean by that. 

It's all about how it makes you feel. Which is the issue with this society. It's always self-entitled. Self-centered thinking about its own self. It doesn't want to better the lives of those around them. It is one degree away from feminism.

>Learning to not depend on anyone but myself for happiness is the biggest step I've taken in my entire life. The fact that there are shitty people from both genders has nothing to do with why MGTOW is still relevant.

MGTOW is relevant in a nihilist society. I've come to the conclusion its a way of coping and becoming just like modern women. Which only serves to divide and segregate everyone. 

But you never see MGTOWs want to get together and build a community. All you get is, ""MGTOW is about your own path"" And being surrounded by self-serving entitled men just reminds me of a male version of feminism. 

What beyond the basics of don't get married and be careful does MGTOW provide? There's no pearls of wisdom beyond a few YouTubers. Majority of golden posts are from The Red Pill and books that don't follow the self-serving approach.

And MGTOW can't even do what they set out to do anyway. They focus too much on negative female experience. They talk about women all day on MGTOW1 and how much monsters they are. They give women their power away by making them the boogeyman/woman.

Atleast The Red Pill aspires for community. Atleast it brings men into its fold and looks after them within their small community. MGTOW does nothing but worship the self. And that's how we got here in the first place.

So you can say MGTOW has helped you. Perhaps it has. But I didn't come here to serve myself. I came here for brotherhood because without it any community inevitably collapses. Just like the PUA community did.  Stronger together, divided we fall. And it will always be this way. A community without guidance is going nowhere. 
"
568,Impossible-asset,"One thing that is an important consideration when you are talking about the principle of ""AWALT"" (all women are like that). It is pointless to bring up ""NAWALT"" (not all women are like that), because unless someone is genuinely disturbed in the head, they will know that out of the 4 billion women on the earth, it is not even statistically possible that every single one will be an ""awalt"" type. 

The whole reason that AWALT is even a saying is because there is enough of a risk in dating, relationships, and marriage today that AWALT is a reminder of a real danger you face as a man. 

If I were given a 50 gallon drum of apples, and only 10 of them were poisonous, but the only way to tell the poisonous ones from the good ones is after I take a bite, I wouldn't be worried about what my odds are of ""finding a good apple"". I'd slap a big warning label ""DANGER: POISONOUS APPLES, DO NOT EAT"" on the side, and leave the whole thing out by the dumpster for trash pickup. 

That's what AWALT is. It's a warning that engaging in an activity has many detriments, and few benefits. It's not a scientific statement. 

Many guys get stuck in being angry after being on the receiving end of a ""poisonous apple"" when it comes to women. And so they choose to walk away from that in the future. Some stay angry, which is what I am hoping to help get them out of by having a sub like this where they can talk with other mgtow men about how they can move on successfully. The other mgtow sub is for staying stuck in the anger side of things. 

What women do mgtow men want? well, depends. When it comes to marriage and cohabitation, the answer is none. For myself, I extend that to girlfriends, dating, and any non-professional relationship. Though some mgtow men are open to that."
569,Deadpanpancakes,"Its not so much that there are a few ""good women"". I think looking at people through the lens of good and bad are too simplistic. People as a general rule are selfish and self serving. Obviously it is to a degree that doesnt jeopardize other things they want. Also, people tend to delude themselves into thinking that they arent ""wrong or bad"" when they want to justify doing something that is pretty abhorrent. Im more concerned about the society around us that holds women to many double standards or the fact that theres sometimes no recourse for a man and nobody seems to give a shit.  You take the shaky moral relativistic nature of women and their selfish attitude and combine it with the male hating legal system and you get men opting out because it is the reasonable thing to do."

This is an out right lie. Having a woman does not make a man happy. If you are a miserable man when you have a woman you will just be a miserable man with pussy.

>It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons.

It does matter that not all women are evil as you say. There are plenty of evil women to go around and all it takes is one to destroy a man's life.

>Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men

This is the men and women are equal lie. Why? Because lets say you have 2 children, the one every time he does something wrong you punish and the other child you allow to do what ever he wants. Who do you think is going to be well behaved the child that was getting punished every time he did something wrong or the child that you did not punish when he did something wrong? It's obvious that it's going to be the child that was getting punished when he did something wrong. In our case men are being punished and women are being allow to go unpunished or get a slap on the wrist. Just look at
all the women that have falsely accused men of rape for example. When was the last time you heard of a man falsely accusing a woman of rape? There is no way men and women are going to act the same when women have the state backing them and men just have
themselves backing them. Also men and women are different so they are not going act the same. Men were the protectors and providers because men think others. Just look what happens when there is a catastrophe. It's men that jump into rescue others at a risk to their own lives.

>All they want to do is moan about women all day.

What this guy is effectively saying is if you're going way why do you talk about women so much. The reason men need to talk about female nature is because we are trying to help other young men not to fall into the traps women and society are trying to get young men to fall into.

>Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving.

Obviously men are going to start becoming self-serving. What did you expect men to be generous when women are so selfish? So men should just continue to give and give and give while women continue to abuse men?

>Society as an whole has become too big

So this guy is into eugenics.

>There are too many issues just to blame it all on women

MGTOWS don't blame all issues on women. We know simps are also part of the problem too.

BTW: This guy is not a mgtow."

618,NakedValhallaBoyyy,"I was a bit surprised just how upset they got over that sort of thing. I understand why they got upset, but I thought they'd at least fight that instinct with the whole going your own way bit. Not everyone who breaks away from the norm and goes their own way is going to go away they feel is preferred.

You don't need to embrace femininity though. We live in a time that people say you need to accept who you are as if that is unchangeable. I tried to just embrace it when I was a feminist and one day I looked at myself and felt like I was a caricature, that 'leaning into it' was just as much an act as trying to hide it.

There is a similar movement that says we need to accept our bodies as they are, but that isn't true. There are certain parts of you that you shouldn't try to force a change on, aspects that deal with your emotional well being and your happiness. But the way you pose, the way you speak, the words you use, how you dress, those are easily  changed things and more than one path can make you happy. These aren't 'who you are'.  These are just the cosmetics of behavior, things that can be easily changed to suit who you want to become."

648,drops_of_Sunshine,"Absolutely loved it! Most modern blockbusters lack the ability to connect us to the character, MCU and Star Wars (Disney) are so fast paced and filled to the brim with jerk-neck transitions and action that I find it incredibly hard to soak it in the way I could with movies from the early 2000s. 

This film had a stillness to it that I particularly enjoyed, you felt each moment of the journey, you were uncomfortable when they were, scared, sad, you felt the emotions of the character on screen and when I walked out, I felt sort of somber, and reflective, the way I do after finishing a good book. 1917 used music effectively, there were lots of quiet moments, and some really beautiful shots as well, but I never got the impression the film was trying too hard to show off visually. 

Went and saw it by myself, and very glad I did! I don't watch reviews or trailers, but apparently it's been hyped up. I've since recommended it to all my friends."

Was at Gallipoli and at the end ended up in Ireland when the uprising started. Was an engineer at the front from the start to the end of the war. Told my father many tales... piles of body parts. How the Anazacs wouldn't salute the British officers, how he got lucky when a shell obliterated all the men near him. The screams from no mans land during the night. How he was angry that in the 1930s depression ex soliders were literally left to die on the streets, how poppy day proceeds were given in greater amounts to widows of officers than ordinary soldiers."

The sniper must have been like a hundred feet away with a clear shot, multiple shots. This movie was a joke.

You’re right; driving on that farm reduced some of the risks. Something could have gone horribly wrong as well. I knew what the risks were, so I took my chances.

My mom used to do it to me. She'd give me points for doing good things like getting good grades, helping her around the house, helping dad with his office work etc.

And then I could use these to buy myself things, like a new toy helicopter, or a bike or a game boy or something.

But the difference is, I was fucking 5 years old and this is a grown ass man, who I presume makes his own money. 

It made sense when my mom did it to 5 year old me, and I'm thankful she did that, she and dad taught me about managing responsibility and the value of hard work among other things.

I'm 19 now and my mom and dad don't do it anymore, since they know that the system has outlived its usefulness

With America's steady rise in popularity in terms of entertainment and politics over the decades, people all over the world have been increasingly made more ""western"", which translates into taking in all the bad points of being an american.

Even in countries like mine which couldn't be further from US, both geographically, and socially, you can see the cancer of western feminism creeping in and breaking society from the inside.

It's difficult to think where feminism is going right now, but for me, feminism as a movement became redundant by the year 2000. Hey, atleast you don't have to worry about fake allegations right?"

810,,"The problem is that the extreme majority of women who are anti-feminists still want all the power and privileges feminism has brought them.  They are against feminism for victimizing men (and for being crazy), but just as strongly against removing things that give them advantages and power.  Such as legal preference in child custody and alimony and the stupidly easy divorce laws, etc.  And when I say ""legal preference"" I mean that the woman is by default the legal provider to the child and so there are actually men out there who pay their ex-wife child support even though the men in question have custody of the child.

Basically, most women who are anti-feminism are pro-girl power.  Which is feminism just without being openly anti-male.  Feminism = anti-male to get power, girl power = pro female to get power.  The power and privileges and dominance they want is the same, they just try to get it by being nice instead of by being hostile."

One of them is a libertarian voting white man, while the other is a Republican voting latino man. One of the my other trans friends is openly pro-Trump, who she sees as the only person who's crazy enough to stand up to the ""liberal"" left (her words, not mine).

On the larger screen there are groups like Gays for Trump who are definitely not aligned with #metoo folks.

As all of you know, there's a personal and professional cost to not being on board with these liberal movements. Especially if you're living in a large, ""liberal"" city, it can be very isolating for LGBT people to be vocal about their beliefs about these catchy-named movements which lack any substance. Not making any justifications though  


Though overall -- I do agree with you. Most of the LGBT people around me have bought the idea that they're ""oppressed"" because all of their ridiculous demands aren't met."
815,,"Genuine question - how do you think I could've stopped getting the award? 

I shared here because I wanted to get it off my chest and fwiw, this seemed like the only place a post like this would be tolerated (even with a throwaway account). Do you think I was treated more positively because I was a woman? If yes, how could I have stopped that?"
816,,"Skepticism is very healthy, especially of things online.

I mentioned elsewhere that I do believe I got and still get special treatment. I despise that, but most of the time it's out of my hands. Those who know me will vouch for the fact that I don't seek it out.

I do think I can be metooed falsely. False allegations of this kind are usually made by people who are mentally unbalanced, and there is no scarcity of psychological issues in the lesbian community. I've had one very close encounter with something like that. I'd share it, but I feel I've shared too much identifying information already, and I don't want to get doxxed.

I'd probably get 50/50 custody ... unless my ex could spin my lack of support for feminism into something evil. I don't know, and I don't want to find out.

Our experiences are definitely different. But that doesn't mean that I can't see absolute abuse of the social and judicial systems at the hands of these women. I have seen more things than I've written here. It's not just about me receiving shit at the hands of women."

818,,"I have to make sure that I'm not being put in leadership positions just because I'm a woman. I've actually been offered to lead teams in areas I'm not comfortable in, and it's a bit of a pickle trying to figure out how to weasel myself out of it without ruffling feathers or causing drama. If I say that I don't think I'm capable enough for the role, people seem to want to ""encourage"" me (because women need encouragement?) 

Luckily, the team I'm with right now, I'm fully certain that I'm a right fit for them, and they for me (at least till six months ago, when they hired the other two women). I know I'd be miserable if I were in a position I wasn't qualified or capable of being in, and I'd fight that tooth and nail. I take pride in my work, and I derive a lot of my self esteem from doing a good job at whatever I do -- I'd hate it to be taken away from me.

This is precisely why I'm against how programs advocating more diversity in tech fields are structured. It just makes everyone miserable.

Having said that, I'm sure I have received opportunities because I was a woman. The prominent one that comes to mind is that I funded my graduate studies partially off a women-only scholarship. I'm not sure how I feel about that. On one hand, I feel that if someone wants to pay money to a certain group of people, they should be allowed to do that. On the other hand, it sucked very bad to see my male peers go through financial difficulties I didn't have to go through, for the most part (though all of us, men and women, were broke, to various degrees, in grad school)"

A nitpick with how you phrased this: I think most women have no idea that MGTOW exists. 

Women and **men** discount MGTOW when they initially hear about it because it goes against the current narrative: men should get married, or at least pursue women, so that they can be happy(!) 

I think the kick-back against MGTOW is through a genuine desire to help men achieve happiness(!) by getting married. 'Won't you be lonely', etc. Painting it as though women hate MGTOW because it teaches men to put himself first is too broad a brush. Certainly some women might see it that way, but for the majority of women who hear about MGTOW: their criticisms of MGTOW are similar to men's criticisms."

That wasn't long ago. And for the most part, it's business as usual in this feminist society, but the cracks are present. 

What I predict will happen is either society will self correct completely, making gender distinction once again fashionable and even marketable. A push back mechanism against this gender neutrality. This could make this whole gender war just a cringe phase in our history. There's still room for ""Something in between"" in this. 

Another possibility is the eventual elimination of traditional roles or behavior models attached to sex. This is the ultimate end game of this feminist agenda. 

Either is a solid possibility. Humans are a highly programmable species. Our sense of morality and normality changes over time, and if things continue as they are now, it's inevitable."

Ultimately our logic and reason tends to crumble when tingles take over and drive us to be able to have some thrill.  This applies to both sexes, though women as the emotionally driven sex are definitely more apt towards this behavior.  Also many people knowingly behave in a hypocritical manner as a way to advance socially. Not everyone has morals and behaves in an ethical manner. Think middle management types and office personnel.

Ayup... I have noted that many, **many** times within my comments in /r/MGTOW.
-
Even came up with a term for them: they're not so much MGTOW as they are the **""Ex""-**Men -- as in **""Ex""**-husbands (the ones who were married & got divorce-raped) and **""Ex""**-boyfriends (the ones who were just cohabiting or in some other ""LTR"" short of the official-legal paperwork) -- and generally speaking they're just going through their *""I'm DONE with women! [And THIS time I really mean it!!]""* phase.

-
I've also noted that -- per both statistics on divorced guys, and my anecdotal observations of men in general -- THAT stage typically lasts anywhere from a month to about a year or so (maybe a bit longer if it was a ""brutal"" breakup or devastating divorce-rape) -- before they start ""testing the waters"" (flirting, eyeing up women to at least potentially ""date"" or ""hookup"" with, logging onto {or back onto} Tinder, etc)...

-
And then, in about 2/3 of the cases, within 5 years they're ""remarried"" again (in scare quotes because they MIGHT just ""cohabit"" instead, avoiding the official-legal paperwork, as if that will save their arse)... with **most** of the remaining 1/3 just taking a bit longer (possibly having one or more ""aborted midstream"" attempts at relationships that fell short of an actual LTR/cohabit/marriage).

-
Overall, I'd bet that LESS than 1/10 (~10%) of them **actually** manage to live the rest of their lives as *true* ""MGTOW"" -- they're just TOO habituated to either the sex and/or the ""in a relationship"" identity, etc -- and too ILL-equipped to actually ""go it alone."""

873,Frelsi_8899,"I view most women this way. 

Here's an experiment. 

Try to have female friends where the quality of the friendship is on par with your guy friends. Suspend any sexual desires, and just try to have a friendship. 

It's when you start holding women accountable to the same standard as men. When your expectations of their behavior are the same as men, that's when you'll start seeing the core problems. 

Most of them are psychotic. Most can barely keep an actual conversation. Most cannot escape their nature and cannot fathom you in any other context outside that of utility. Regardless of your best efforts to befriend a female with any hope of forming a normal friendship. Disappointingly you'll end up just being that nice shoulder to cry on. 

You'll quickly fall into the stereotypical bullshit where you sit around listening to her relationship woes. Until she's vented enough, has a paradigm shift and now has no need for the dynamic of the relationship she pushed. So she will drop you. 

Sorry to say this, but we only ended up in this shitstorm thanks to feminism. In our school days, we had it right. Most of us weren't friends with girls. We had a saying ""Chicks are for banging"". 

I'm 42 now, and yeah I even have a few female friends. They're all ""normal"" by female standards, but when you get closer they're flakey, self-absorbed and frankly a bit insane."

And then the irony of it is that the ""new"" one they eventually pick -- choose or fall for or end up with depending on how you look at it/label it -- is often (and we're talking *blatantly/obviously*) ***cut from the same EXACT cloth*** as the one they just divorced/got divorce-raped by/were alternating between crying & raging & grieving over just a year or so prior when they were in their reactionary (faux-MGTOW) ""I'm DUN with women!"" stage/phase.

-
We're talking almost IDENTICAL... as in even down to their NAMES\*...
-
So they divorce and/or get divorced by *Louisa* (that bitch, can you believe she cheated with the NEIGHBOR, expected to be forgiven and for hubby to still be NICE to that neighbor?)... but then FF a couple of years and who do they hookup with and marry but a 2x divorcee (with kids and thus one or more of her ""ex/baby-daddy"" guys nearby), and she is named... wait-for-it... *Luisa!*  

-
WTF? That's like trading off an old used Chevy because, well *""it got dented up in an accident""* and you just CAN'T STAND the idea of driving a dented up car (etc) -- but then going out and buying **another** old used Chevy, except one that's even MORE dented up because it's been in *multiple* accidents (and from the looks of it possibly even driven in a ""demolition derby"").

-
Moreover, while there usually ARE some -- relatively superficial -- differences (i.e. the first wife was a blonde, the second a brunette, etc) when it comes to voice & speaking pattern, inflections/accent, even general overall behavior & ""character"" of the person... DESPITE the insistence of the guy that ""this one is DIFFERENT from the other one""; the resemblance is sort of ""uncanny""

-
A half dozen guys that I know PERSONALLY (as in been friends either with them or with their families for decades) have followed that EXACT same pattern\*\*... it's to the point that I figure one can PREDICT (with something like at least, *if not better than,* 50% accuracy) both when and who (name/character) they WILL ""partner up with"" again in fairly short order.

-
**But to get back to YOUR point...**
-
Yes I'd say you're correct in that it is somewhere *around* if not ***more than half*** of the guys on various MGTOW forums (/r/MGTOW and /r/MGTOW2 especially) who follow that pattern.

---

And then, as you said at the end of your prior comment:

>>On the other had you have guys like me that aren't mad, we just don't give a sh!t.

EXACTLY.
-
Unfortunately... because MGTOW forums are virtually the LAST ""male space"" that allows such bitching *(sort of the same as why the guy being cheated on/divorced ends up calling his [never-married] BACHELOR buddy at 2AM*\*\*\**)* -- we end up getting painted with the brush of THEIR ""blue pill raging."" (And while **WE** calmly, coldly, objectively {and yes often a bit harshly/brutally} talk about the REALITY of female nature {and MALE nature as well, though that is often overlooked/forgotten}; **THEY** {recently or 'in the midst of' divorce/d guys) come in, repeat & exaggerate the points about WIMMIN... in an angry ""red pill"" RAGING-story fashion, bitch about their wives/gf's {especially the ""cheating"" etc}... and so the accusations of ""misogyny"" {which then have some validity}.)

-
Just like the ""incels"" -- the not only NEVER been married, NEVER ""fucked""; but *most often NEVER dated, kissed, or been even the least bit 'intimate' with a female in real life* -- who plop in, MISunderstand what MGTOW is about (often only imbibing and regurgitating the superficial ""meme-pic"" garbage), and thus contribute to the mischaracterization of the whole enterprise.

-
**The TEMPTATION** is to BLAME them... but of course the fault really lies with US (the true/actual/real ""MGTOW"" -- that is time-tested/proven as such); in that **we take PITY on these ""pathetic"" creatures** and let them into our ""clubhouse.""

-

---
\* Which I often have to wonder whether it isn't ""on purpose"" as a sort of safety/insurance -- I mean so long as the name SOUNDS the same, then if in some moment of passion (or memory error) they say their EX's name, well no one will be the wiser -- but regardless, it's rather WEIRD/TELLING that the guy who WAS married to ""Louisa"" ends up marrying a ""Luisa""; or likewise with other name-combos; the guy who divorced ""Cathy"" then marries a ""Katherine"" [Kathy], or yet again from Sarah to Sara, Susan/Suzzane[Susie/Suzie], Mari/Mary & even Marianne/Mary-Anne, Ginny/Jennifer[Jenny], Kristina/Christiana [Kris/Chris & even Krissy/Chrissie etc] and so on...

-
\*\* And there are other elements too: basically the DEPTH/HEIGHT of the ""RAGE"" and/or depression/crying that ensues... is a predictor, **not** of them *truly* becoming or following MGTOW, but rather the opposite; the MORE they rage (or cry, complain, etc -- same thing really) the MORE likely they are to ""return to the plantation"" for round #2 (and #3, etc).

-
\*\*\* Mainly because -- well not only do WE actually ""understand"" the situation (we've seen/heard it dozens if not hundreds of times before) -- but we're the only ones that will (or even practically CAN) actually TAKE their calls... especially at that hour of the day/night.  They DARE not call their other ""married"" buddies (assuming they even have such), lest they create further problems."

Over the last year I definitely see tiredness and bleakness wash over him. To me this reinforced my idea of ""shut up and do."" The time for talking is over. You want to help men? Mentor them, guide them, help them network and get jobs. No need to talk to anyone, that is what females do...sit around and gossip to get another being to do the heavy lifting.

They also have far too much time on their hands and get deeply caught up in first world problems. 

Now a subset of these due to their vindictive nature and misguided compasses are just in it to stir social unrest. Some even might believe they're doing good, but without the intelligence and foresight, they cannot fathom the deeper implications of their agendas and they have no empathy to begin with anyways.

894,,"I specifically said ""in my experience"" for that exact reason. You may have a valid argument if I implied this was a fact in all cases. However, I made it very clear that my statement was based upon pure anecdotal evidence. Why are you so determined to be combative over such a non-issue, anyway? In my observations, that, indeed, is usually the case. That's strictly *my* reality. If you've observed and/or personally experienced differently, that is strictly *your* reality. It doesn't make either of us entirely right or wrong, nor does it suggest that the scenario described in the OP is purely a fabrication that never happens. I was offering a different perspective on the point in the discussion which is based on a false premise; that all single mothers are proud to be single mothers and shamelessly flaunt such a status. 

There are multiple causes of single motherhood where praising said mothers for raising their children alone is appropriate. The example I listed  in my original post is common in my community. Right below that is the father being murdered. Right below that is the father being imprisoned. All of these examples were caused by either the fathers themselves or third parties. The single mothers who manage to raise their kids alone when faced with these situations deserve to be encouraged for it.

On the flip side, single fathers get special attention as well because they go against a negative stereotype that fathers turn deadbeat when they separate from the mothers of their children. They also receive well-deserved praise if they raise their children due to the mother being an addict, imprisoned, or dead. There are many variables to these situations, and frankly, I find it crass and myopic to paint all single mothers with a broad brush because of this."

I would say guys do it to but they are either assholes or being sarcastic and will let you know right away. But even the assholes are rather rare in doing this because they know such behavior could lead to an asswhupping or at least people not wanting to hang around them.

Some single women seem to think they are above society's niceness as though they were a celebrity. They see nothing wrong shit testing their host despite the obvious rudeness of it all.

However there is another reason for it as well. They think being a bitch makes them more attractive because they have been picked up by guys who were jerks to them. It's a reversal of expectations. Girls are used to guys being nice to them so they take it for granted. When a decent looking guy comes along and doesn't kiss her ass, she thinks he must be on a higher tier therefore she finds him more attractive than the nice guys. 

Guys are more used to women being bitches to them or at least cold and indifferent. Guys are just likely to be put out by a bitchy woman either getting angry or losing their self esteem. The guys not phased by it are the usual pump&dumpers whom the girls later will claim they are tired of due to all the ghosting."

This is extremely true. I don't come from a background of having been screwed over, my marriage never had time to go bad. So i never developed the personal distaste. Thus, i don't avoid women at all except the part of being alone with one.   


But i do see that the more attractive ones are the ones that can't in the least understand why they're not wrapping me around their finger.   


To be honest, If i would say that I have a ""type"" these days.. even though i don't engage.. It would be the plain janes. They are usually much more relaxed about things. And they can often spend a whole evening being just pleasant company. Something a hot woman can't do nearly as often.

919,iluvfrostidflaks,"i’m kind of confused about what a shit test is. my ex wife used to demand i let her go to clubs and hang out with guys etc. is that a shit test? or how about, if i was in an argument or confrontation with a stranger, she would butt in on the stranger’s side if they were guys. is that a shit test? or how about, she would always make snide/snarky remarks, disagree just to disagree, make disparaging comments daily. is that also a shit test? and what response are these women looking to in these shit tests? my ex never acted this way before we got married. only afterwards did the ugliness start (literally on day 1). i didn’t give into her bullshit and she eventually took off and filed for divorce. what are they trying to accomplish? find a man who’s the perfect chump who will tolerate their shittiness for a crumb of pussy?"
920,BoomFreedom,"F, for solipsism."
921,Heisenbergeffect,Thank you!
922,Heisenbergeffect,">d and accomplish big things for yo

Best of luck to you. I really have no good advice for your situation, i'm sure that there are others that can do better. What I do know is that you need to make sure that the finances gets in order. Nothing, and i mean nothing will allow you to be a better father than not having to constantly stress over that.  That breathing room has been my saving grace in so many ways i cannot begin to tell you."
923,ValhallaBoundBoy,I am curious about your story here.
924,Dls95405,"The boy's mother is dead. Not only did you miss that important fact, but now we must assume you are critical of his story, since she is 'non-existent'. So, what's the criticism?"
925,ace_kantrillo,"> My wife passed, and I was left with my son who is 6 now, (he was 3 then)  

Literally the second line in the OP."
926,MementoMordor,"No, shit test is when they try to figure out how you deal with being dissed by them by for example talking your fries or insulting you in a more or less obvious way.
They don't want a push over but they might settle. Just know that a woman who views you as weak will resent you. 

What your woman did was just shitting on you, sorry. 

There are videos about shit test on YouTube and I think The Rational Man (book) explains it too."
927,Uniqueinsult,"The last part made my day a little lighter. Thanks. I'd also like to try to answer your question. As a young man who has seen some shit, I'd say the females get a taste of power every time they do that. It strokes the ego and eats the soul- I did not intend to get philosophical with this. They want to feel like they've made a guy their little chump, to manipulate.
I'd say its quite fashionable for the female to have a little pussy-begger-slave behind her as I see this sort of behavior quite frequently. In my opinion, it gets her respect and jealousy from the others in the female collective or ""hivemind"". This phenomena seems to be quite ubiquitous these days, given the emasculating soy boy producing society we live in."
928,BadDad01234,"Thanks! And yeah getting financially stable will be my #1 priority. Will be tough and my family is out of state as are my friends. So basically I'm hitting the reset button on my life which I think i need. So definitely not going to be in the dating scene and MGTOW helped me in that regard. I'd like the company of a lady every now and then but right now I just have to focus on me and my child and no one else. When the time comes I'll be more financially secure, in better shape and will have options. And will never remarry. Life will be good it just will be a tough road but I'm looking forward to it!"
929,BadDad01234,"I made a couple posts you can read. A lot of it is on me. I was in a dark place for awhile and didn't know it really. Caused chaos (affair with a co-worker, how cliche) But I've been in therapy, stopped drinking and have been doing the best I have ever been physically and mentally. And despite my username an excellent father as well haha. We've been talking divorce because despite doing well I just haven't had the ""passion"" she craves. Kinda hard to be passionate when she won't even touch me.  But I do speak her love language which is gift giving and words of affirmation. It just hasn't been doing anything. I told her maybe talking divorce would ignore that spark in me to want that from happening. How could I fear losing her and divorce if we didn't go through with it? And it did. Started researching and man...fuck I just don't want to do it lol. I know id be settling and that's a bitch thing to do but I just want to be absolutely sure for the sake of our child.

Well come to find out she's been cheating on me. Just found out last week actually. I don't know all the nittty gritty details and honestly I just don't care or need to know..I know all I need to know which is to get the fuck out while I can. 2 wrongs don't make a right and we both have contributed to making a shitty situation

So yeah...I just have zero fucks to give right now. We're going through with divorce and keeping it amicable. We're going mediation route, no lawyers. We make the same amount and want to split everything evenly which I'm cool with.

I'm just a bit scared in how I'll survive on just my income. Family is a state away. Ill be ok just may have to do some side gigs or get a 2nd job and figure out if renting an apartment or owning a condo/townhome would be best for me. A lot to think over.

But red pill philosophy has helped me so much. I've learned a lot about myself, my wife and life in general. I'm a MUCH better person than I used to be and will continue to be so for the sake of my daughter who is my world now"
930,iluvfrostidflaks,"having dealt with one who literally left me for not putting up with bs, i was under the impression that a push over is what these cunts want. but oh well. i think anyone who feels the need to test someone is a piece of crap and not worth any effort."
931,principledbeast1,"Boundary pushing is also a shit test, though less obvious. This is how men end up saying "" I have to check if it's okay with my wife""."
932,iluvfrostidflaks,this is what i was thinking. i disagree with the prevailing attitude that almost all of them want a guy they see as strong. i think what they are looking for is that docile and thirsty chump who will worship them no matter what they do.
933,Heisenbergeffect,"Here's some things that helped me early on.   


Set up a home, make it your way and start living in it like YOU want to. But, my one big advice is this. Keep it clean. There is nothing that can bring your spirits down like a messy home, and once it gets really messy, the task of cleaning it seems bigger and bigger. It took a long time before I managed to pull myself together and start doing this right. But it made a huge difference in how i felt about myself. As well as being able to open the front door and not be embarrassed. I was in a long slump and my house was a total mess.   


Don't live to impress, get only the home you need. There's only 5 people in the world that actually care about your home, the rest are either ok with whatever you have or jealous. And you don't need jealousy in your life.   


Wealth protection before generation. Pay off your debts, even if it sucks. Don't start to try and invest etc until you have your debt situation well under control. ESPECIALLY high interest debt. a 19% credit card is a much better investment to pay off than the stock market. And once you start owning things that other people have payments on, you'll see how much money that actually is. I couldn't believe how much money I was able to save once I had no more payments. Even though I understood it theoretically, the feeling once you see the numbers start adding up in your accounts is pretty powerful.   


And above all else. One day at a time, nothing happens immediately."
934,ValhallaBoundBoy,You're getting full / majority custody?
935,MementoMordor,"They can't help it. It's in their DNA to test potential partners, they are not bad people. Just be aware.
In your case, she probably saw you as a provider of some sort. They have different rules for this and the ones they really want. 
Maybe you are soft or you got played by her or yourself. Learn, accept, adapt! (sounded like a self help book there :))"
936,Uniqueinsult,"Well this is how the story goes these days man. I woke up at 17 after dating a crazy young woman, tested the waters of a relationship again at 18. Conclusion: weird world we are living in."
937,BadDad01234,"This is all amazing advice thanks! Especially keeping my place clean. Our house as it is is a nightmare half the time and constantly smells. My STBXW just doesn't clean. At all. So most of the cleaning duties fall on me so I'm already used to it but it will be much easier solo. 

Fortunately I'm debt free. Unbeknownst to me my wife wracked up quite a bit of debt over the past few years. I might have some responsibility with that which sucks but you're right I will get whatever comes my way cleaned up first. I don't know much about investing anyways I do have a 401k going which is good tho"
938,BadDad01234,50/50 which we are both cool with. She needs her mom and dad and we don't want anything less. As shitty as it is to say the week off will be nice to recharge (and make money hopefully) We've been doing it for a bit actually in just handling responsibility and it's honestly made me a better dad. I go hard on the love and attention and focus when I know she relies on me and no one else. I like it. And like that Louis CK bit at the end of the week I can take a bath in vodka and my own filth lol. I can be a killer dad half the time
939,,[deleted]
940,Heisenbergeffect,"Not sure about the facts in your case, but yeah, depending on your state and WHEN she racked up that debt, you're probably going to owe half of it. 

Seen that happen too many times."
941,ValhallaBoundBoy,Ah okay. When I hear 'single parent' i tend to think of the parent having majority / full custody.
942,ValhallaWillCome,">They have different rules for this and the ones they really want.

He's implying that you were not the one she really wanted. It's not a diss, he's merely implying she may have thought you fell under the beta bucks category (aka, the one she wants to settle for) and you not accepting her bs put an end to that. You did the right thing."
943,nostonewhereIlay,"I see your in the States, not sure about your laws but in Canada you are not responsible for your wife or live-in’s debt unless you specifically signed for joint responsibility. Luckily I was just reading this yesterday at a consumer proposal site. So if you didn’t sign specifically your in the clear, at least in Canada."
944,BadDad01234,Ah yeah that makes sense. Wrong phrasing lol. Divorce isn't actually too common in my circle I guess. Divorced dad I guess I should say.
945,iluvfrostidflaks,i’m referring to his “maybe you are soft and got played” comment. nothing i posted earlier even implies that. thats a passive-aggressive sneak diss from out of nowhere. you gotta be a real bitch and a loser trying to build self esteem to act that way.
946,ValhallaBoundBoy,"Your vernacular is cool with me, pretty sure most people use it the way you do, not the way I do. NGL week on and week off does sound like a nice lifestyle. Perhaps I'll find a lady one day who wants that kind of arrangement."
947,ValhallaWillCome,"Rereading the entire thread, it may have been a diss indeed. Problem is that I can interpret  “maybe you are soft and got played” two ways. One being a diss and the other being a hint. Not putting up with BS is one, it's how you end the argument that either shows her whether you are ""strong"" or are feigning ""strong"". This is something women will pick up on rather easily, where you may not have. If he meant that, it's a hint. If not, a diss."
948,iluvfrostidflaks,"i see your point. if thats what he meant then i’ll apologize for my other comments, but it really looks more like some random sneaky insult. and the point of what i said earlier is that these sort of tests and other asshole behavior won’t get women very far with men unless they find one who is willing to put up with it. in my case most of it was unwarranted and i stood up for myself early on after noticing a pattern of totally unwarranted bs. thats when she took off. lol."

Guys. Am I missing something here? This sub states it's for focusing on independant male life, not for focusing on women, and yet here is another shitpost about johnny Depp's girlfriend.

So. Heres what I'm thinking. Since I can remove these posts / lock these posts all day long and they just seem to keep on showing up. I'm thinking every time some OP who isnt an obvious alt account or troll breaks the rules, I lock the post, and then give OP 24 hours to post something about how mgtow is helping their life. With a positive perspective, or take a ban that gives them enough time to think something up. 

I'm serious... this is NOT a carbon copy or refugee camp for men who want to lay claim to being ""mgtow"" and just spending their time bitching and complaining about women. 

THINK about what mgtow is doing for you to make YOU better. Then post that. You can talk about where YOU used to be when you were blue pulled, and you can relate that to where you are now that you are a mgtow. 

That's what this sub is for, and constantly removing posts and saying ""refer to sub rules"" is not being as effective as I'd like in promoting the content this sub was meant to showcase. 

So... comments locked. Timer started. OP will you be a participant of this sub how it was intended for mgtow men? Or not."

They all neglected to mention the poor woman broke her arm when the dog attacked her, so she was in shock and unable to fight the dog. Luckily, a man was there to step in and save the child. He motioned for her to get help while he dealt with the dog.

Everyone in the thread ignored this part of the story, even when other people were posting links to the news article explaining the circumstances. The comments were disgusting, and not at all about GYOW.

1027,ValhallaBoundBoy,"Banned with no explanation. After weeks of messaging mods one said that I was banned for 'concern trolling' and cited a specific post. The post in question was about a comment that people on the board make a lot, that 'women have nothing to contribute to a relationship'. Which made me think, What do we have to contribute to a relationship as men? Perhaps money, but what else?

It wasn't concern trolling it was a genuine question that wasn't just about everyone else, but about me as well. What do I really offer in a relationship?  A lot of people freaked out in the comments, kept insisting they have 'love, loyalty,' those vague intangible things a girl would say as well.

But some of them made a really great point: men are a human shield. We are expected to lay down our lives to protect a woman, even if we aren't dating her. If we are just walking down the same alley as a woman and someone comes after her, we are expected to put ourselves between her and the attacker. As for women we actually date, its basically a 'get out of jail free' card for as long as they keep us around"

1029,UnfunnyName22,"Things Are Getting Out Of Hand (repost) (got banned from MGTOW for this statement)

Both MGTOW and feminism are at each other's throats like cats and rats and I'm getting confused about it all. There's so much hate that both sides have lost sight of what the actual point is. 

I thought we were all for equality, but all I see is women giving advice on how to subjugate a man, or men pushing for dystopian misogynistic ideals. At first, I was completely and utterly fooled by the MGTOW movement (being a man, of course) then after going through all the hostility, I see one post about someone climbing a beautiful mountain, achieving satisfaction, and being a better person from the experience. 

When I saw this, and then looked back at all the women slandering comments, I was like Jesus, this guy really knows what MGTOW really is. 

The people in that sub have got it all wrong, sure there IS inequality, but, throwing more fuel in the fire for feminist activists ain't gonna help.

I remember seeing a black man on TED who went to talk to the leader of the KKK himself, (link here -> https://youtu.be/ORp3q1Oaezw) and after so much diplomacy, got him to leave the group. It showed me that if each party respect each other, they'll bond and find trust within each other to work forward towards a common goal.

But with feminism (in it's current state) and MGTOW, it feels like the point is to pull each other apart as much as possible until a breaking point. Sure, there are pretty bad cases out there, but don't you think we should band together for a common purpose to change those laws and make it truly equal?

Both sides, men and women, have lost the point. MGTOW, if they are going their own way, need to cut out the obsession. Feminism and predominately 'feminine' groups such as the female dating advice subreddit, need to stop clearly trying to provoke bitterness between the genders and look for a common ground to start building good relationships with men over.

I'm just sick of it all, you can't trust neither side."

1031,Gozie5,"The first sub I was ever banned from. I mentioned that it was being infiltrated by many that do not know the meaning of it. 

I was having a nice discussion with another and our of nowhere the admin banned me. 

Terrible admins."
1032,HohmannTransfer,When r/incels shut down I knew they would leak into a bunch of other subreddits and fuck them up.
1033,Mr_Crick84,"I was banned a while ago for simply saying a grown man had made the choice to be with a single mother and there is nothing wrong with that.

MGTOW was completely overrun with hateful incels and for some reason the mods were supporting them. All of a sudden incel terminology was being used to shame people that often had done nothing wrong.

To me, MGTOW was about internalising the rational male principles and choosing not to go along with it, Not trying to change human nature by shaming and hating on people.

For a group of incels that hated women and simps so much, They sure are sacrificing a lot to increase their SMV and be with them. I should have left a long time ago"
1034,Great_Sandwich,"Wtf..?  Seriously??  Yeah, I just got banned yesterday.  Why?  Couldn't tell you.  I think it could possibly be for referring a guy who laid out a bunch of VERY specific standards for the women he was looking for to a Christian dating site.    

Suddenly... banned. 

The fuck is with those guys, over there..?"

I basically just said that my thoughts vary from ""I'm 100% with you"" to ""sounds bitter, but for understandable reasons."" to ""WTF is wrong with you for glorifying sharia law?"". What should I say? Approximately 5 minutes after I posted this I got the notification that I'm permanently banned. I couldn't even have a look at the reply to my comment because everything went so fast."

I'm going to get downvoted, but I think it needs to be said.

There are many people here in the rage stage, and some incels that have moved to a new home, and that's okay, but it's not a place where you get to bitch, ad infinitum. At least it wasn't before at 60k.

For many men it doesn't get better, particularly if the child died instead of just being taken away."

1050,MisanthropeArtichoke,"I guess I have to join the club. The comment for which I was apparently banned related to a female astronaut collapsing during a press conference. The assertion made was that the collapse is proof that woman shouldn't be astronauts. 

My reply: ""Eh, I'd be leery of making assumptions. Maybe she's sick. Maybe her blood sugar was too low. There are a lot of explanations for a collapse. Maybe the stress of space travel, lack of gravity and whatnot, acts different on a woman's body. Who knows. 

Just because one female astronaut collapsed doesn't necessarily say anything whatever about female astronauts in general.""

1089,redpl4net,i got banned for telling a tranny that shes not a man
1090,Aladdin70,Just got banned for downvoting a couple of nasty posts against female homeless .. and some other low effort female bashing. it's pretty funny how you can be a member of a group for months and the moment you say something against them you're gone.

1095,Kratos_Junior,"We gonna come back stronger...

1096,Silva_Shadow,"As a subscriber to both, I can say that I don't believe many of the negative posts in here about mgtow, because I've not seen that on there, mgtow is literally calling out has behaviour from women and they don't like it.

R/MGTOW has been infiltrated by feminists and women complaining, this place is next because you Simps create divisions instead of just saying the truth, which is no one was breaking the rules in mgtow, no one was inciting hatred, only support and calling women out in their bad behaviour was what it consisted of. Anyone else saying bad things about mgtow is lost likely lying."
1097,whotfleap,"There was a post that I replied on saying how if you're not on Nofap you're not a real MGTOW. Got banned from the commenting again. I have come to a conclusion that it's either undercover simp maginas or feminist in this subreddit. And I'm standing by my argument that it you're not on Nofap you're really not MGTOW. No fap should be practiced by everybody in MGTOW, but I guess it's okay to jerk off to a chick that you can never touch. I shouldn't be banned for speaking my mind, that's literally what the community is about.

1098,RyansPutter,"Some guy was hawking fleshlights as a way to get over horniness without having to deal with women.  I said that it's possible to have relationships with women without marrying them or engaging in a LTR and called OP an incel because he is.  Not Reddit's ""If you point out sexism against men you are an incel"" definition but the actual definition.  


I'd been lurking there off and on for a while.  But the bullshit's gotten out of hand.  Yeah, there are a lot of shitty women out there, but I'm old enough and experienced enough to recognize red flags and avoid them.  Most of the posters there see fake red flags everywhere.  


Reddit's just an echo chamber.  I remember on an old account I got banned from /r/conservative for calling out anti-Trump conservatives prior to the election.  Then later I got banned from /r/The_Donald for criticizing a couple of Trump's policies.  I got banned from /r/news even though I never posted there.  I got banned from /r/datingoverthirty for going against the grain when there was a ""single moms are so strong"" circlejerk."
1099,FaAlt,"I know /r/mgtow got quarantined, but I really hope they don't flood this sub.  This sub is about living your life single, not about complaining about women.  Although the titles are similar, the theme is very different."

1104,Wokchefjosh,"I haven't been banned, because I don't post there. I read their BS sometimes to understand their perspective though. Basically, they just want to have their bitterness/hatred affirmed by other males who feel the same way. It's one big, depressing circle-jerk. It must be a sad life, to go there and engage because it's the only place you feel validated. Pathetic, really.

Then, there's the female version... How many of these places exist?

Edit: These people just needed a friend to tell them...give it time and it'll happen/you will meet someone. I didn't have sex as early as a lot of people. I remember some athletes at 16 and then through high school everybody acted like they were having sex. I'm glad I never got any STDs or had any kids too early for me to handle. I eventually blossomed. Everyone does...except these losers. I wish I could reach them but they're done listening."

Why is it always about what the men are doing and how do we stop that? What is it with society wanted to put so many different controls in motion on every level of a man from his dick/circumcision all the way to his psych, to laws of the land marriage/divorce, expectations as far as being provider, protector. What did they think would happen! Are we really just a slave gender that gets rewarded with ""a good life"" unless we screw up? Bummed out."
1112,the_ultimate_salvaje,"Left a comment on mgtow and got banned

So someone posted a picture of baby yoda saying he was born a mgtow and I explain that there is no such thing only incels are born that way. I explained that Incels love to claim mgtow cause they can’t get women but the women they do they will become a fierce little male feminist and will turn on mgtow. I know this cause I seen it with my own eyes and for saying this I was ban.  Luckily I used a throwaway account but wow I can’t believe that mgtow defends incels as if we are all incels if I wanted to be part of a incel community then I would but then again I can’t cause I’m not ugly or fat or short so I don’t fall under any of those categories. The reason why I’m a mgtow is cause I been with too many women and they are all the same. Incels want to believe they are truly mgtows but are you truly a mgtow if you never even experienced betrayed by a women? Dated one after finding mgtow and realizing that everything said her is true? Maybe is just me. 

Ps don’t ban cause I’m not a fucking incel. I’m a mgtow but not a incel."

&#x200B;

1115,durzashade22797,"Someone posted on the subreddit trashing K-pop groups for wearing makeup on stage calling it the results of women's drive to feminize men and all that BS, calling them Simps and shit. Now I didnt care incredibly much about K-pop I'll admit, but what I did care about, and I felt was worth discussing is the stigma behind makeup itself and masculinity, and how just because someone wears makeup to enhance their features and cover imperfections so they'd feel more confident about themselves doesnt make them less manly or a simp or a fag (a word I saw frequently in the comments) because there are plenty of perfectly good (and straight) dudes who rock a face of natural makeup. It was a stupid argument I'll admit, and I regret getting involved in it, however i dont I deserved a ban. Especially since the way I see it, a man going his own way to feel confident about himself in whatever ways he sees fit whether it be regular gym visits or regular sephora visits without worrying about what other think is a fairly MGTOW concept."
1116,RetroSpud,"Beaned for calling out misogyny, my comment had like 20 upvoted lmao"
1117,NotAnotherDingBat,I simply mentioned that most of them have not gone their own way. They’ve replaced dating women and being taken advantage of with using all of their energy with resenting them. Moving on is moving on. They’re out of sight out of mind. It shouldn’t mean you become more obsessed. And I was banned
1118,Immarrrtal,Got banned for asking about wanting to live life with a kid or two but without a wife. Like wtf MGTOW
1119,RIPOldAccountF,I got banned for saying that telling women that they should have kids asap because their best years for statistically having the best chance at healthy offspring is probably not the best idea. That along with welfare(single moms make up 75% of welfare) are contributing to young single moms which lowers the pool of women men would want to date.
1120,TheValhallaBoy,"I haveb een banned again. This is my third time. The mod I had reached out to last time suggested I just create a new account so I did, and it's been less than a week, I've only gained 100 karma, and I'm already banned. No idea why. I refused to even get into disagreements this time, but it looks like asking for male only movies and making the title a tongue in cheek 'sexist movie club suggestions' was enough to do it."

Since MGTOW supported men, I asked about what the men of that sub thought regarding forced and toxic masculinity, and their personal experiences regarding it. I just asked.

But it seems they want psychopaths and dumbfu#ks on their site instead. For some of the cretins on that site, emptying their bowels without it being in their pants is a success.

1149,totallossguy,Gtfo this sub is not for you
1150,l0nes0mec0wb0y1306,So MGTOW nowadays is about bitching like a feminist but in opposite direction. What a joke.
1151,MGTOWMODSSUCK,this is exactly where I got my username from; calling out racism on the sub and getting banned.
1152,realMisterBryan,"Yeah I got banned for something similar. Someone was insulting the fact that AOC (who I don't even like) is *just a bartender* (which is totally false, she's a congresswoman now) and I said it would be like insulting Trump because he's *just a TV show guy* (which is also false, he's the president now).

Here is the comment:

https://old.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/ekenqp/the_word_men_is_missing_from_this_because_men/fdb5vf4/

TL;DR - there must be a real fag in the MGTOW mod team. I bet he rides a harley too."
1153,bhfanatik,"seems like it has become a MAGA sub. Any opinion criticizing Trump is downvoted to the abyss or even banned. They pretend they're going their own way but they fantazise about a conservative society and obssess about ""owning the libs""."
1154,MuleFool42,"Yep. They trigger easily to anything that doesn't conform exactly to their belief system. I don't get it. MGTOW should be for every man to understand as a lifestyle or philosophy to live by if they so choose. Everyone guy will have his own version of MGTOW, it doesn't have to be one-size-fits-all. 

Very limited thinking over there."
1155,Impossible-asset,"Men dont need a safe space. 

That's not what this sub is. 

This sub is for showing yourself and the world how you can succeed and do well and be happy in adverse conditions. 

That you dont need women, or any of the bullshit that femenism sells you. 

That you can live and be perfectly happy with your friends, your wealth, your health, your wisdom and hobbies that you enjoy. 

You dont get banned here for saying ""men only"". And women dont get banned here either just for being here. 

Anyone who comes here, and very simply follows the sub rules, is welcome to talk."
1156,Lil-Leon,If only that had been true and the sub wasn’t used to post super misogynistic shit at best and radicalized right-wing shit at worst. Then it would probably still be around.

1159,MyLittlePonyofDoom,"Yeah I think you’re right. Alt right redditors managed to take over subs by infiltration, somehow banned other mods and poisoned them. Now incels have done the same to r/MGTOW."

1163,TalosSquancher,"It's Reddit's shadow sensor, that awkward turtle fucker."
1164,Impossible-asset,"You're right. ""Calling attention to"" something =/= hate. 

Here's the rub. It is *easy* to bitch about something that bothers you. It often takes much more introspection and thought to come up with a solution. 

Here, this sub is aimed as representing the positive sides of mgtow. What is can do *for* a man, vs just complaining about women. 

Now, maybe by tightening things up on the posting guidelines, the sub might shrink. I'm good with that if what does get posted is positive and helps men show their accomplishments, or have meaningful discussions focusing on living a full and satisfying life vs complaining about the ""nature of wahmen"" and such. 

Jokes and memes and posts bitching about women have their place, it's just not this sub, and to allow the posts that focus on women or ""calling then out"", just detracts from the goal of this sub."

1173,MuleFool42,"At least you got a response. Most of the time they are scared to say why a person was banned. I was banned after I told someone that hate is a bad thing for many reasons. First, it means that you care and that you're giving power to the other person. It also isn't good to let hate rule your life because it's unhealthy. 

They absolutely couldn't have that, I suppose. I was banned with no explanation because their a bunch of scared little bitches that can't actually admit to their hate or they'll be quarantined. So they won't say anything,just ban people with no explanation."
1174,Great_Sandwich,Same for everyone here.  Nobody ever gets an explanation from the mods.
1175,Impossible-asset,"I think you're confusing mgtow with mra's.

Mgtow gives zero shits about any of that. It is what it is and we're perfectly content to walk away from it, and the culture that goes with. 

I have no bitterness towards women or feminists. Their bullshit doesnt stop me from getting laid as I please, without having to compromise my own self-interest, and no risk of sexual harassment or divorce rape.

I just go to other places where the cancer of femenism has not spread. 

If you want to change laws and have some sort of ""come together"" moment, you are in the wrong place. 

We dont care. We're finding our own way to happiness and satisfaction in life. We've figured it out that quite simply, we dont need women.

1181,MuleFool42,"That's terrible. I think women should know about MGTOW and understand why it's important for men to be MGTOW. Not because men and women need to hate each other (we don't), men just need to be aware of how society views them and how to mitigate society's negative influence on their lives. 

Instead, the focus is on hate and negativity. It could be so much better but the mods are children that can't see the big picture."

Ultimately, they're giving true MGTOW a bad name."
1234,Impossible-asset,"I disagree with that assessment. 

You're combining two different things.

Men who desire women but cant ""get"" them are involuntary celibate men aka incels or omega males etc. 

Mgtow men are men who *could* (and in the vast majority of cases, have) had women, and were often married, but have been burned by the courts in a divorce or seen how society supports the word of a woman in judgement versus the evidence given by a man. 

Both men may be angry, but incels *stay* angry. 

Men going their own way have decided that they want to simply walk away from the laws, gynocentric society, and drama that marriage and formal relationships bring."

You sound like one of those feminist women complaining. Or maybe you're an incel or a troll, I don't know, but you sound pretty out of the loop on this. r/incels got banned, then r/MGTOW went to shit, and now your stupid ass is on here calling us simps. Go fuck yourself. The original sub did start becoming hateful, that's why the first rule of this sub says no women-hating, hate and negativity. 

And when it comes to the negativity part, I consider all the shit I just said to be pretty fucking positive, considering the fact that you just called all of us simps when this a place for people that live a life of not being a simp. Go fuck yourself. ❤️"

Why?

Because his posts on ""pointing out the misandry"" were removed. He was told why. He was told this is not the sub for that. He wanted to insist that oh yes it was too the sub for that, and went posting more ""misandry"" stuff. He was again told not too, and instead this time told to focus on himself in a post not on women or the system... he again refused.. so .... yeah, the guy caught a *Temporary* ban, and was told he'd be welcomed back to post content that follows the rules and spirit of this sub when he returns. Instead he went to another sub and started yapping about this one. Ok then. 

Glass house my ass .... go over to mgtow1 and post some shit there and see how far that gets you with the mods. 

See if they dont bamhammer you immediately with no explanation or response to a message. 

Maybe go over to r / aww and post pictures of animal abuse because you're trying to ""expose those abusers""... let me know how fast you get banned from there. 

Dont come here, break the rules, ignore warnings, then get pissy when you catch a temporary ban because of it.

I didn't even reply to the notification because I knew this would be a battle that's not worth to be fought and I have bigger problems that require my energy. 

Your right. It's time that women learn about the reasons why more and more men are disinterested in marriage, having own kids or just being in a relationship. It doesn't have to be in a way that tells us ""you're all a bunch of disgusting evil shits without morals and the only way you're good for is to wreck a men."" more like ""hey. No need to be mad. It's just that the current laws disadvantages us and we don't want to risk losing our money and even freedom. It's just self defense that, hopefully, sounds logical to you."" just to answer some questions other women might have. 
I understand your reasons why you avoid women in the way you do and I feel really bad for you. If it would be men who could completely destroy me after divorcing I would want to stay away from them as well. 

Let's just hope that government wakes up, changes the laws that allow women to ruin their men if they divorce and starts letting men keep their money and property and treats them equally to women when the question who gets the custody over the kids needs to be answered. Society could be so much better if this change takes place."

On the other hand, the vast majority of these feminazi subreddits ban men/people subscribed to subs regarding men's rights. This way it's even better from a political standpoint - while they are unable to hold a serious, respectful and sometimes unpleasant conversation with those who they supposedly have problems with, we can, which makes us actually more inclusive and open than places like FDS or TheBluePill for that matter.

I'm not a mod there so I dont know the policies or whatnot, but it's not the moderating path I goto. A lot of subs do it, but that's up to the moderating teams.

I do think that talking shit about women certainly has its place. Consider golf courses or cigar clubs or poker tables. Men need a spot to complain amongst themselves about shit that frustrates them, and for a lot of men, that is women. 

I agree there should be subs that allow for that. There does need to be moderation though because the incel rhetoric can easily grow out of that, and that should be kept in check. A lot of that shit is pretty unhealthy."

>We need a community that doesn't ban men for trying to gather and help each other, and every other social media platform is happy to censor or ban any and all men's content if it isn't tits, ass, and/or beer.

Reddit admins are far above mods. If they don't like your sub, they'll find an excuse to quarantine/ban it. See the Trump-friendly sub for example.  They can even go into the database and directly edit comments without any trace. If you want to create a free speech community, reddit is not your best bet, and I have no idea what is. Sites like discord demand your phone number for """"verification"""", and if you happen to live in a country where burner phones are banned _(muh terrorism)_ then it's pretty much self-doxxing."

2020 going to be hella fun.  75% of China is shut down due to coronavirus.  2nd largest economy in the world.  Its lot worse than they letting on.  Bet that virus was leaked out of Wuhan level 4 Biolab thats literally 10 miles from that seafood market.  China’s Chernobyl.  Couple of countries were already in a recession especially China.   US is not far behind with their QE repo market.  All that Central Bank money printing can’t go on forever.  

Feminists sjw failure, pending very bad recession and a very contagious coronavirus.....  lol.  This clown world is about to get worse while I just sit back in my chair eating popcorn.   Strong and independent?  Don’t need a man?   Ok...  I’m stepping out.  Lets see how women do without men.   lol"
1454,TimJohnsonIII,This is why I don't give a crap about reddit. Women write bad things about men all day long on reddit and their groups don't get banned.
1455,Muslim_Jesus,Social Justice Warriors at work
1456,PutridMeatPuppet,That was fast.
1457,sean_lx,"I think reddit needs to come out with a “public warning” on subreddits that let’s the subreddits users know that it is violating its policy, give it a few strikes before a quarantine takes place. That way maybe more corrective action can take place. Quarantines should be temporary depending on the circumstances as well. 

I understand that many MGTOW people have far right views.. but there are legitimate issues that men face today (as there are with women) that have discouraged them into relationships and so fourth. 

Personally, I see courts bias  (child custody/divorce), state laws bias, a need for mandatory paternity test at a child’s birth and cultural expectations that reduce men’s equalities in some areas. These I believe, are legitimate and noteworthy concerns.. I don’t understand why instead of a actual debate of these issues, that I ought to be labeled an “incel” or some other derogatory name.

Hopefully freedom of thoughts, expression and speech prevail on reddit. And if not, perhaps a non-profit version of reddit can be developed that is self funded through its users that donate to keep it running. (Like Wikipedia)"
1458,someonequeefed,Wait this can be banned/quarantined but girls titties and assholes are ok on Reddit? What the fuck planet am I living on?
1459,mansrandom,"I disliked it over there because of the constant bashing, but I really hate censorship more. It’s not going to fix things, as they’ll just find a new platform. 

I’m glad for this sub as it’s primary focus is self-improvement. The mods will be pressed a lot more the coming weeks, and I hope that this sub remains. 

It’s important to have a group that shows that we can all be better no matter our circumstances and what heals the burns of being a lone wolf."
1460,wishiwasthruhikin117,It’s men aren’t allowed to voice their anger and dissent. Trust me them banning this will only piss people off more. I guarantee it.

1467,Usuqamadiq,"Reddit (and Google) is a state actor of China. They accepted $300 Million to fund the site and regularly suppress content critical of the Chinese Government and actively allow pro-communist and socialist propoganda and posts to flourish. 

https://fortune.com/2019/02/08/reddit-is-blocked-in-china-but-may-land-a-massive-investment-from-tencent/

Their lack of action to outright calls to violence from the Socialists and Communists on reddit and failure to equally enforce the rules/TOS are a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the requirements of 47 U.S.C. § 230. 

Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco and thus must abide by US laws. It isn't in their Terms of Service or rules that they are acting as a Chinese State Actor, thus they are conducting fraud against US Citizens. 

This censorship of US citizens is a violation of their First Amendment rights and private company or not, they operate a social media company on US soil. In the 2017 US Supreme Court case, 2017 Packingham vs NC, the Court stated that social media companies and cyberspace are the modern public square for discussing and disseminating ideas and this First Amendment protections apply.

Reddit acting as a state actor of China and censoring, banning, shadowbanning, or deleting US Citizens posts or quarantining communities is National Origin Discrimination pursuant to 42 USC § 2000a. US citizens and Patriot's have a right to free enterprise even on social media and it is a violation of US Federal Law to discriminate based on their National Origin, even Patriotic Americans whose pride and beliefs including gender roles and outright opposition to systematic Misandry prevalent in modern western society you may not share. 

Please copy and share this everywhere. Feel free to improve upon it which better research as I am not a lawyer. Mods should really add it or a version of it to the bot post at the top of every thread.

The feminist cunts get their way, yet again. Reddit is a cesspool of cucks & simp libs. I've literally seen hundreds of posts dehumanizing, vilifying, abusing, ostracizing men all over the place and they get thousands of upvotes. But, god forbid if you ever criticize women. Lol pathetic. 






What's the ""official reasoning"" they gave for quarantining?"
1469,FrozenVoid,"Quarantine is an early warning to archive their content/links ASAP.
Many quarantined subs get banned later."

Couple this with the fact that the mods ban anyone who gets reported for any reason, and the sub is going to die, and the potential growth of the movement with it."

1483,MuleFool42,"I think that in general, Reddit is too censorious of ideas. Our whole world now, seems to be based on right/wrong think and if you hold a minority view on something based on lived experiences that go against the accepted group think, then you get censored. 

That said, I don't feel sorry for r/MGTOW. They express too much hate for women and other groups. That is not what MGTOW should be about. It should be for every man because it is beneficial to their overall well-being and long term prospects and happiness. 

Hate is not required."

1485,NotherThrowaway284,"> We don't need a bunch of posts about it clogging up the feed. Other posts on the subject will be removed.

Amen to that!

I still suspect the news report of that guy who was planning a shooting was what actually got them quarantined.  I mean, Red-ditz is a corporation and corporations are always, **always** giving themselves heartburn over liability issues.  After the incel and alt-white invasions, though, I say ""no love lost.""

1492,Fer1015,"I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand I feel that they took what they deserved, when they proceeded to censure and bann everyone for holding and sceptical view about how they were handling the movement. On the other hand I'm not very confortable with the way Reddit is going, it might be the first step to label whatever subreddit they want under ""hate speech"" for staying in the opposite side of the spectrum of some minorities conformed into pressure lobbies who wants to impose their views as the only accpetable in the name of social justice here on the internet."

1494,OfftheHeezee,that's what those clown ass fools get. always bitchin' about females.
1495,redzox18,"CMIIW but isn't MGTOW supposed to be the 'fraternally supporting men into maturity and good masculinity' kind of sub? 

70% of the hot page as I see is all about 'women/feminist being assholes' but it always appealed to me that being an asshole goes both ways. 

Seeing the bashing posts only seemed like some people spent too much time on the sub and not on ~manly~ self development. Not on ~going their own way~  No wonder it got quarantined if that's the case

I mean yea women could be hoes (experienced it first hand) but men could be playboy assholes too.  It's not *Men Going Their Own Way* if they keep talking about women."
1496,NaturalisticPhallacy,"This sub is like /r/ExMormon, but you’re not allowed to complain about why you left the church. Pretty pointless."

1504,sigma4488,"Of course it’s quarantined, it’s an incel breeding ground with self deprecating people that cannot look themselves and blame others for their problems. 

I’m sorry you had no game or social skills in high school and couldn’t get a girlfriend. The world isn’t evil or out to get you. It’s time to grow up and not be self hating. 

Act like an adult instead of crying over spilled milk. Get off the internet. Socialize. Be better. Do better"
1505,unknownmgtow,Did they shut down feminists subs too.. or is reddit being sexist?
1506,bluehorserunning,"The R0 of the Wuhan novel coronavirus is between 1/3 and 1/4 that of influenza, and the mortality rate is between 2-5% (probably closer to 2).  The people who die are exclusively immunocompromised, elderly, or otherwise already ill. 

Yes, even a 2% mortality rate is very bad, and yes, an R0 of 2 is enough to sustain transmission in a large population... but it is nowhere near what you would need for a bioweapon.  If it goes global, it will be like the modern era’s bad flu years at worst, not like the WW1 flu. Which is bad, but not the end of the world. All of the data suggest that it came from bats (like most of the Coronaviridae), via some other animal. 

Please do some actual research before you spread conspiracist theories and fear-mongering."

See every believe women argument for proof."
1509,VestigialHead,"I agree with this.  Insta quarantining is not a sane thing to do.

Same with insta perma bans.  Should be removed.  Ban for three days as first warning.  If the person then continues to break rules and a mod goes to ban them it will then open up more long term bans.  Only giving the option for perma bans after three lesser bans have been completed.  Anyone who is then perma ban could be checked by the higg tier reddit mods to make sure it is not simply mods drunk with power."

1511,FirmFirefighter,I don't know but I am raising a toast to its obnoxious moderator being banned.
1512,TigPlaze,"Plus, they used a straw man as an excuse.  They claimed some MGTOW member was planning terr0r attacks and that law enforcement tracked his web searches of dangerous topics.  They didn't quote a single post this person made on MGTOW.  So someone can click on the ""join"" button and then search for nefarious things in a search engine, and get a sub banned.  Notice they never explain exactly how a MGTOW moderator is supposed to police what a member searches with a search engine or why that's supposedly a reasonable expectation."
1513,,"True, but the real reason it's quarantined is because many young men come across it while browsing reddit. There's a fear that if more men continue to leave the plantation, feminism is dead in the water. What an embarrassment that would turn out to be."
1514,Trek13,Reich wing shit like this is part of what doomed MGTOW1
1515,redsenior,Double standards
1516,imthewiseguy,I got autobanned for posting a comment in menkampf literally seconds after.
1517,VAJattConfederate,Issue is this mate Reddit is a private web site that pays for it's own server space. They can ban and censor what they want. I myself am an ardent MGTOW and reject a lot of hate society places on us  men especially in family court. If you all want your own spaces go to separate websites and servers managed by MGTOW supporting reddit is useless.
1518,,"I remember reddit being vehemetly opposed to PIPA/SOPA legislation in whichcensorship was the main concern, and now THEY'RE censoring stuff they don't like. Bunch of hypocrite wankers."
1519,MrDanduff,Goes both ways man. I remember at the beginning the sub was full of posts focused on empowering men without being toxic when discussing about women. It became real nasty the past 2 years.

1523,Terminarch,"...no. I won't speak to the China thing because I haven't done that research, but there is no precedent for that being discrimination based on National Origin. It's just regular violation of Free Speech which frankly is worse anyway.

1529,Skywilder,"Nope. It’s gonna stay quarantined and a dead mass of toxicity. Used to be a kickass subreddit about dudes being dudes, going their own way. Now it’s a clusterfuck cancer shitshow of overflow users from r/incels and a bunch of them got modded and now circlejerk each other over banning people for wrongthink."
1530,Bloodrain_souleater,Spoken like a true feminist. You do know the so called feminist sisterhood preaches the same damn thing. Mgtow is individualism not group cult bullshit.
1531,BilboBagginhole,There is this:  [https://www.goingyourownway.com/](https://www.goingyourownway.com/)
1532,thisisd0g,"It's called MGTOW2. The original mgtow was packed with incels. Which by itself isnt necessarily a bad thing as I can understand where incels are coming from - dealing with similar problems when I was younger. But it becomes an echo chamber which can produce some pretty malignant attitudes. 

MGTOW (at least to me) isnt about hating women. It's about being indifferent to them."
1533,Pedang_Katana,How come it doesn't count? I rarely visit that site so I've no idea what's going on behind the scene.
1534,fmanly,"Yeah, I had seen the same thing. It is just quarantined.  Here is the behavior I saw:

1.  The sub disappeared from my list of subscribed subs.
2.  The sub's content disappeared from my front page.

I then navigated to reddit.com/r/MGTOW directly, and got the quarantine warning.  Once I acknowledged it I was brought to the sub.

At that point the MGTOW sub STILL doesn't appear in my list of subscribed subs, but now the articles do show up in my front page feed alongside other subs.

Bottom line is that with quarantine they are trying to get people who aren't actively visiting the sub to forget that it exists, and taking subtle measures to try to decrease the popularity of the sub, without outright banning it.  I suspect they have statistical data that the measures they're taking lower traffic over the long term, otherwise they wouldn't be stopping at what they're doing.  

I believe it also makes it less likely to show up in search results.  The goal is probably so that when guys type in the search bar ""does anybody else think marriage isn't worth it?"" or something similarly general they don't get pointed at MGTOW subs.  If they haven't heard of MGTOW already the goal is that they don't hear about it.

I'm skeptical that this sort of thing will do much in the case of MGTOW.  The trends that are driving men to go their own way are so large that it is going to be almost impossible to stop this without making big changes in how society works.  Half the trends on twitter/etc are practically advertisements for MGTOW..."

1552,Americanpewdiepie,"Why do you think? It’s obvious. They don’t want this idea spreading. Men, especially white men, are probably the most attacked people right now. It’s like a fucking white genocide right now. Obvious. Anything that gives men power back is being crushed."
1553,rak__z,It's incredibly common for subs to limit discussions about current events to only one stickied post to prevent floods of low effort posts that are the same thing. They're literally providing you with a platform to discuss the event why are you even mad.
1554,Impossible-asset,"Because the sheer volume of people talking about a certain issue in a new post every 2 minutes would quickly overwhelm the sub. 

Placing a mega-thread provides a place for people to discuss the issue or event without constantly rehashing the same point over and over, and leaves space in the sub for the content the sub is setup for."
1555,Dissentient,"This sub was made in the first place because people wanted a place to discuss MGTOW, without being drown in posts bitching about women, which is 90% of content on /r/MGTOW. If you remove that rule, there's no point existence of this sub. You can just go to original sub instead."

1559,SmexyCucumber,"I'm not saying that either is right. But women need to stop being treated like babies. They're grown ups whether they act like one or not. It's unfair on the men who lost their MGTOW sub, when the women over there are given free reign to rag on men unchecked. Double standards aren't cool. Unfortunately, I doubt something will ever happen about that sub because they're women and society won't see under their facade. They can do no evil, right?"

1561,jcar99,"this was my main issue with that sub. i had to unsubscribe because after a while it was extremely obvious that a majority of the people on there didn’t really care about self growth on their own as a single man, but instead hated women for virtually no other reason than because they were women. 

i was so sick of people just being blatantly sexist on their with their old, shitty, boomer facebook memes and everyone in the sub just eating it up. honestly glad it got quarantined"
1562,MrJugsMcBulge,"There was always a bit of that in the sub, but it got a LOT worse once the Incel sub was banned.  Also didn’t help that TFM and other content creators embraced the “WAHMEN ARE ALL STUPID WHORES” incel faction."
1563,Impossible-asset,"I disagree. This sub is geared to help you move forward. 

This is a place to put your money where your mouth is. 

You a mgtow? Ok. Put up or shut up. Post it. What are you doing with your freedom from women and the societal laws that aim to tap your resources and use you as a battery?

You making money? Getting healthy and staying fit? Out for a 3 week hike in the mountains with your dog? Travelling europe maybe? Or just enjoying a peaceful evening of quiet in a home you own (or even built?)?   

A lot of redpill subs provide a space for whinging about what made you angry. This sub is for you to show ""where are you going, now that you're going your own way?""

This sub is for looking forward, not backward."
1564,rojhalat,Exactly. People saying don’t tell other men about the women that made you go mgtow are just trying to kill mgtow.
1565,lonewolfhistory,"To be fair, Redlib dose NOT communicate and when they do they lie and Mislead on why they do anything. And honestly, the sheer hypocrisy is part of the outrage"
1566,rojhalat,And you do? Whats the reason? Don’t tell me misogyny or some bs because femnazi subs are still up and running.
1567,Carlooos_uhhuh,Shut up

1582,MgtowData,That suggestion is absolutely laughable. You have a large philosophical community you will inevitably have a large amount of different view. Aswell to suggest that was the reason it was taken down is even more laughable. The reason is to shut peoples minds to options and information to more easily control them. Aswell to  keep the welfare system going through theft of money via child support.

Somewhere it turned into a wall that incels hid behind as a reason to justify why they couldn’t get laid or were scared to talk to women."
1594,30203forever,Have you ever tried posting anything there? I dare you to try...
1595,fugluru,Well it’s nothing new that a quarantine is just a ban but without being honest about it. Wouldn’t want to say you hate the content. But anybody with half a braincell.(so not the average ahs follower or anyone that thinks mgtow is a hate movement) will see that it’s just a complicated ban
1596,binkerfluid,it also hides the number of subscribers and online members as well

There is a user on there I won't post his reddit screen name but he is literally all over it. Anytime there is anything said on there he says women only want money. This is guy is clearly rich but it seems his money is driving him mad. It is almost pavlovian as well as boring and annoying. He seems to be in denial that women want anything else in the world other than money. I can think of a lot of things they want that aren't about money (but probably require it- but hey thats how we are all enslaved if money didn't exist we would be murdering each other ). If you go on there and you don't know who I am talking about you will. Except oh you are banned!

**People need therapy, which requires talking about past traumas. Just like denying ex Mormons the right to complain about “the so called church” as they call it, denying men the right to complain about their relationship traumas with women is doing them a **massive** disservice. **

This sub is not geared to help anyone because it’s actively censoring the elephant in the room, By refusing to be even acknowledge the reason why men go their own way more than half the discussion and healing that could be had is denied. 

Again, **this sub is pointless** bordering on actively harmful."

Current numbers suggest about 85% mild illness, 15% serious illness (which is very high), and 2-4% mortality within Wuhan (overwhelmed medical system) with mortality 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower outside of Wuhan, where more ICU beds are available.  

N19Coronavirus appears to have originated in Wuhan and has not ‘Run its course’ there or anywhere yet. None of the reputable projections I have seen propose 33% mortality there or anywhere else."

Good overall summaries for non-healthcare people

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/
About 2% based on *known* cases. There are certainly many cases so mild that they do not come to the attention of health care. The vast majority of those severely affected and dying are elderly, ill, or otherwise immunocompromised. Last I heard, no one under 15 had died (unlike influenza, which kills many children every year). 

Now, how about you provide your sources for the conspiracy claim that it’s a bioweapon (note that I don’t take YouTube or shock jocks as ‘sources,’ and I’d prefer valid medical sources), and that everyone is going to die and civilization will fall?

Think about the torrent wars 20 years ago.  Imagine instead of shutting down napster/etc the RIAA managed to find a way to throttle it so that downloads worked, but were painfully slow.  If they found the right balance then a lot of people would have stuck with it due to the effort required to create something new, and then the painful experience would have helped reduce the number of people pirating content.  Instead they used a sledgehammer and shut everything down, and thus there was a huge void and somebody created a new technology to fill the void. Then because there was no competition, everybody rapidly adopted the new technology.  If there was instead competition between the legacy technology that had a painful experience but an extensive library of content, and a new technology that was better which nobody actually used yet, then that would have fragmented the community and slowed adoption.

I think that is the goal here.  Don't scatter the roaches.  Instead get them to huddle up while the oxygen is slowly removed from the compartment.  Plus you get less outrage because it isn't a complete ban."

As I've said before to posters in the past who want to some here and just try and hijack the sub to turn it onto the ""mgtow is about complaining about women"" train tracks, I'll give you 24 hours to read the sub description and rules, then post *literally anything* that follows those rules and relates to YOUR mgtow journey and how it is impacting your life in a positive way.

I mean that if you get infected, you either defeat the virus or die from it, given enough time. Most of the lamestream media only tracks how many people get infected and how many die on a day, they don't track the infected ones whether they can fight it off or die from it on longer time periods.

It's like marriage and divorce stats. The state gives you how many marriages and divorces happened in X year, and the _crude divorce rate_ is simply calculated from these two numbers. They don't track individual marriages to find out if a spouse died or they got divorced after 45 years."

Except that is far from the only rules as published in your side bar,  if those where they only rules I may not have a huge problem with them.  Personally the rules I find most objectionable and subjective is the ""effort and quality"" rule,  ""civility"" rule, and ""relevance"", all of which are WIDELY subjective

Then there is of course the rule about ""No denigrating other subs for the quality of their content."" which is routinely violated when it some to talking about MGTOW1  and other subreddits you dislike which is amusing given your complaints about how MGTOW1 is moderated, a complaint I disagree with having seen nor had any issues with the moderation there.

>If your idea of ""going your own way"" is complaining about women, then this probably isnt the sub for you. 

While my idea is MGTOW is not complaining about women,  I left my rage phase well over 20 years ago.  I have been MGTOW for longer than MGTOW has been a thing on the internet,  and longer than many on this subreddit have been alive.  

However this subreddit seem to be more about Physical ""success"",  believing that the ""true path to MGTOW"" is body building gym rat shit.  I have no interest in that.  I pursue wealth building, FIRE, intellectual interests,  not dieting and exercise which seems to be focus of this place,  so you are likely correct this is not the subreddit for me

I mention the moderating habits of mgtow1 because it's relevant to this exchange as I'm expounding on the sub reddit rules for you. There are different moderating habits for that sub than there are here. For example, you havent been banned here for questioning the mods. Try that on other red pill subs and see how far that gets you. 

You may object to the content here. You may object to the rules and how they are enforced. Id refer you to the banned from mgtow mega thread to get a good idea from people who have had dealings with the moderation practices there.

I have on MGTOW,  I was not banned. MGTOW and MenRights are the only to men subreddits I post to,  the others do not interest me.  

I challenge mods all the time in Subreddits,  sometimes I am banned most times I am not.  I have challenges mods in MensRights, MGTOW, KIA, KIA2, and several others

I do not fear bans,  reddit to me a time suck,  something to do when I am bored.  I express myself if people want to ban me for that well that is their problem not mind.  Being a closed minded fool generally results in a shitty life. 

>But I'm not changing any of this sub because you disapprove

I am not asking you to,  I was simply pointing out the hypocrisy and bullshit.  I never had any expectation that my words would result in any changes. 

Subreddits like this never really grow beyond  a few thousands members because of the massive limitations on what can be talked about.  That can be a good thing, close knit communities can be good.  Sucks for a movement,  sucks if you are trying to bring actual awareness to what MGTOW is and how it can save men, but...

I browse MGTOW and MenRights in the hope that I can help a man cope with what is happening to him in his life,  this is why I am not put off by the posts in MGTOW1,  I want to help those men move past that rage on to something better.  You want to reject them and isolate them.  Different paths, different goals

>If you dont like them you can move on if you prefer. Nobody forces you to participate here. 

I probably will,  There is not much discussions here that interest me. I like to talk politics,  I like to discuss how the Culture war effects men, how politics effect men,  etc.  This is what I want to discuss,  you ban those discussions so...

Also I have had this account for 2 years, so it about time I nuke it anyway and start over....."

The reason is that, for the past several years, we've seen nothing but all these stories about how ""science shows"" that men ""need"" sex and female companionship to be ""healthy.""

There are still some who are sticking by that, like the Campaign Against Sex Robots woman.  I've also seen some pushback against that from the femmstappo, specifically the whole complaint about the tendency for men to be ""emotional golddiggers"" on their wives, and that the wives need to be compensated for the ""unpaid emotional labor"" of loving their husbands...or...something...

Which means that more and more people, I think, are going to come around to our point of view.  And if folks like Sprankle won't, the feminists surely will, when they actually think about this ""need for human companionship"" and ""empathy,"" and realize the implications for them."

1736,Robert_is_a_Loser,"Yes absolutely get a life before considering getting a girlfriend. The last thing you want to do is make your girlfriend your ""life"" It's a mistake many guys make (including myself back in the day) 

Just become familiar of female nature to protect youself. If you have a life before dating you have the freedom to ""not take no shit"" when it comes to her because if you leave her you will immediately have more time and money to do what you want to do."
1737,Hawgster,After being betrayed and divorced. Still losing so much financially to it every month. I don't think I care to find a woman ever again. Just look forward to the rare times when I can get my kids. Pretty much what I live for at this point.
1738,GlobalAsshat,"That's really the way to do it. You hear that old cliche that you have to love yourself before you can love someone else. Life goes in a natural progression where important skills are built as you grow up and a lot of people get fucked up in childhood by not having good parents, a good father figure, or a good circle of friends, and that fucks up their personality, so they end up socially awkward, lacking the ability to hold an interesting conversation or make people laugh or in general small talk, and for men this really gives them a big disadvantage with women and life in general if they can't fix it.

Social-proofing is by far the most important skill to have in life. It's one of the essential skills that leads to a stepping stone to bigger things in life. A large majority of men have varying levels of beta in them but the ones who don't grow up socially well adjusted really end up being the ""creeps"" of society. There's also the matter of having no father figure and an overprotective, coddling mother... I've seen examples of what happens to kids with this situation, still living with grandma at age 40.. nice enough guys but never really pushed to be independent in any way. Women can get away with this because men are always chasing and ""saving"" them, but for men this will lead to a feeling of unfulfillment because men are biologically wired to want to achieve greatness."

1745,Traveler11819,"what's the old saying?

You will lose a lot of money chasing women.. but you won't lose women chasing money"
1746,rockstarsheep,"No matter what anyone says, your biology is going to predispose you towards wanting to mate. At a certain age, when your sex hormones kick in, and you have a sex drive, as sure the moon exerts an influence on the tides - you are going to feel a pull towards whatever is your sexual preference. That's just Nature / Life at work. It's an undeniable fact, for most people. 

Unfortunately, this can play havoc with you. And it does; for men and women. As this sub is focused on men and men's issues, we focus on that. In a way, ""MGTOW"" or ""GYOW"" is really a form of transcendency. That is to say, to transcend your natural drives; master them and shape them, so you create a form of life that suits you best. That's really just the beginning though. 

Over time, you change as a man. Your testosterone levels go up, peak, and then come down. Many men, mellow out, with time and age. They are less aggressive or seek to be less dominant over others. And a whole host of other changes.

There's inherently wrong with having different kinds of relationships with people. In fact, you need to relate and work with many different kinds of people over your life time. Men and Women, have been trying to figure each other out for who knows how long. Perhaps since the dawn of time. We form complex relationships with each other; whether it's family, friends or lovers. Some are long term relationships and some are short term. We all make mistakes; every single one of us. It's how we work towards resolving them, which counts more than anything else. Unfortunately we live in a very strange time, where there is a sort meaning vacuum and people are just super confused. A lot of ""traditional"" ideas, have been thrown away, being considered old fashioned, useless and meaningless. However, that can't all be true though. 

* Dignity
* Trust
* Faithfulness
* Honour
* Responsibility
* Integrity

Are these values and virtues, really to be thrown in the trashcan? I don't think so. 

And really, finding someone to really bond with, is incredibly, if not the most difficult thing to achieve. It does seem like a fairytale. I can maybe count three couples, over the course of the last almost half-century, that I consider to have a really good, mutually beneficial relationship. The next segment is okay, to not so great and then there's a vast gulf of just mediocre, to terrible and then awful. But it is indeed possible to find someone decent. How, when and where? Nobody can answer that. 

And my friend, the only thing set in stone is that you are born and that you will die. Everything is up for grabs. Probabilities and possibilities; you just don't know. The likelihood of better results, depends on you and the decisions that you make. You may need to take your time and work hard at yourself and those you allow in to your inner world. You probably will. 

The only ""advice"" I can give is to vet everyone in your inner world. Make sure that they add to your world and you add to theirs. More than likely the emptiness you feel, probably really has nothing to do with women as such, but about the meaning and purpose that you are going to give and find in your life. Seek that out first, and everything else can fit in around that."
1747,starfox863,Good for you
1748,Erwinblackthorn,"Women don't fill the void. They chain us to decrease our options. That's why they are called the old ball and chain.

Think about trying to travel somewhere. First you need permission from your bank, to see if you have the money. Then you need permission from your job, so you don't get fired. Then you need permission from the government to see if you have a visa. Then you need permission from the airline to see if you have a plane that will take you. Then after all that, you need permission from the girl.

She's at the top of the permission pyramid. The one factor that doesn't even involve the actual travel process, and this is the one that has top priority. And if you don't please that one, your trip becomes a miserable mess that you paid for.

That's the kind of stuff that makes us go ""why the hell do I bother adding that extra factor, when it doesn't even please me? What are my options?""

1750,Aszourus,"Saying the point of MGTOW is to not have a girlfriend is thinking with the original r/MGTOW mentality. Not all women are the same just like not all men are pigs. AWALT is a childish concept.
There are still women who submit to their men and are mother and caretaker figures who don't mind life being that way, these women are also hated by feminists. There's even women who actively have been fighting for men's rights before you guys even knew of this whole movement so be a little adult and logical and realize that while the majority of women all think the same there's always an exception to the rule.
Saying stuff like this is just like feminists saying all men cheat and all men are toxic.
MGTOW is putting yourself first, learning to recognize the toxic women and avoid them, doing what you want on your terms. If she wants to be in your life there's sacrifices she should make. And just like people said here, don't settle with anyone in any way that makes them entitled to take your shit from you. Be the best version for yourself that you can be, and don't let any woman stand in your way. If she doesn't like it that way then she can take the highway."

The mainstream media (from Shakespeare to Tinder) is selling you the notion that you need a girlfriend. 

There is no reason that you have to do what they say. What's more, unless you build up yourself and your life and your status first you probably won't even mix with the kind of women that would enhance your life.

And maybe this is a part of our nature that works against us, an evolutionary baggage we're better off casting aside. By definition, only a minority can achieve greatness, because to be great means to be great relative to someone else. The majority of men are going to lose in the arms race of greatness, just like the majority of men will be betas no matter how much lifting and self-improvement they do, because the game is always graded on a curve. Individual men can rise up and down the hierarchy, but only at the expense of other men, as the 80/20 rule remains in place.

For some MGTOW, a STR MAY be a risk worth taking, but NOT to cohabitate or to intermingle finances in any way. 

For others, it may mean Monk Mode, whether that’s be for a short term or permanently.

Truly it is a treasure trove of what not to do, and occasionally a nugget of wisdom. 

What have I started, very slowly, is to create some YouTube content. It's not specifically MGTOW, but it is related to finding and living in a meaningful way. Believe it or not, I have some training as a therapist, so it integrates some of that.

1791,impossiblezagnut,"It's only expected because men were and still mostly so widely inclined to do so.

More people, and more importantly, young men are increasingly becoming conscious of this, which is why we see a large shift in dating strategies and the masses abandoning the olds traditional ways."
1792,rockstarsheep,"Pick something that is relevant to you. That always makes it easier. 

You have touched on a very interesting subject though. In fact this might be something to explore. What is it though? 

There is no *summa summarum*; which means. There is a sum of all sums. A coherent system of hypotheses; whether these are ideas that come to us from the sciences, philosophy or any of the other humanities - that neatly folds things together. At least not in this particular subject. 

It would then appear, that there is no central theme, beyond the very narrow confines of such ideas as - hypergamy^•. 

^•= I call to attention, the notion of hypergamy, because it is one of the bedrock concepts of RP ideology, as it relates to the nature of women; and for two reasons. 

The first is that it might very well be a retrospective projected idea, less than what reality actually is, in itself. Some academic work has begun to actually interrogate this concept, and it would appear, that it may not be completely true in an absolute sense. 

Now, this is not unusual. Often, with knowledge, and the discovery of it, we can at times, mislabel certain phenomena, because we either do not understand it.  Or, out of convenience, impose a definition that is meant to be temporary, but through common use, becomes the standard definition. 

That is to say, it may indeed be incorrect. This poses a problem to someone like Rollo Tomassi, Richard Cooper and a whole slew of others, who have purchased their position of authority on either, misinformation, disinformation, or pure chicanery. They have a vested interest in maintaining and defending their position, because, in one way or another, their relevance and in some cases, their income relies on this. They have a vested interest in their truth, as it pays them to do so. They have an incentive here, which also stretches further in to the lives of those who take their thoughts, opinions and insights as incontrovertible truth. 

As no one has risen to the challenge, or indeed opportunity, to test the hypothesis of hypergamy as such, the idea and those who advocate it, have been safe in their assumptions. However, this is slowly changing. There may be an element of truth to it, however, it may also be, that it has been starkly over emphasised. 

Just recently, Shawn T. Smith; a highly trained and capable psychologist, has very politely, questioned hypergamy. And it with some interest that I watched Rollo squirm, as the headlights of professional rigour and experience, started to question, what really might be a pet theory at best and pure speculation at worst. 

Rollo has the gift of the gab, and can twine a word salad of concepts and ideas, in order to muddy the water. He can, as a fall back, cling to the notion of the stories he has heard from others, and use this as proof. Now, there may be some truth, in the stories of others, but there is such a lack of sophistication in terms of definitions and the collection of data, for the purposes of deriving some sort of truth; that cottage wisdom will do ... for now. 

That is not to victimise or lionise him. We all make judgments of error, and believe in incorrect assessments. Every one of us. It just gets highly amplified when a personal misgiving is transmitted to a broader audience, that then accepts it as unquestionable truth. The concept may require some calibration, however, that may cause the invalidation of some of the key premises. 

We will see if the truth is more important than the individual, in good time. 

Now, the second part is this. 

The nature of men. I have yet to encounter a term, such as hypergamy, when it relates to the *innate nature of men*. I am quite confident that the feminists would clamber to screech out the term; Patriarchy! 

Laughable as that is, it is still a very powerful concept at play in our world. It is at best, a shorthand summary to describe how women have been exploited and victimised for the benefit of men. Now, before I descend in to that pit of hell, I'll stop. And continue as such.

Men **and** Women can behave themselves in less than ideal ways. Both sexes can be destructive, shameless, thoughtless, cruel and otherwise indifferent. On the reverse of this, both sexes can be creative, remorseful, thoughtful, kind and interested. Some men **and** women, can exhibit more or less of the above. And we can further narrow things down. 

Moving on; some men are not particularly fantastic human beings. They can exhibit some of the lesser qualities that they're accused of, but to wholesale clump everyone together, is a massive mistake. This also brings in to question, the measure or measures by which we want to judge men or women. Who is deriving the score card, and how are they keeping score? What are they enumerating and quantifying, for the purposes of judgment. Nobody really seems to know. It is taken as a given. 

There are no easy to grasp values to use, but general concepts of acceptable behaviour. They in themselves can be horrible stereotypes, or indeed, truths. 

So, we seem to lack a critical framework, by which to evaluate and comment on the nature  of men and women. Beyond the tropes of; ""Lift and make bank!"" 

My little conclusion is this. We need to be critical of accepted wisdoms, or apparent truths, and not go with face value agreements of their validity. We need to have proper discussions to explore the ideas that we have been given. To me, that is an essential part of going your own way; responsibility for the evaluation of information, for the purpose of defining a set of values that you can live a good life by. 

A very big problem to overcome, is the demands of immediacy. Now, now, now. Most good things, do not come about in the - *right here and now*. They take time to cultivate. It takes work. It requires some humility, patience and courage. And most of all, it demands honesty. That my good friend, is quite difficult to achieve. And it is a problem that has been with us, for a very long time.

So, there you go! My little thoughts for the day. Thank you for your kindness and I hope that you are keeping and doing well."
1793,Aszourus,"I am talking about also our responsibility, you say media as if it's an entity of its own run by itself. Let me remind you most big media corporations are run by men themselves. So yes we have been digging our own graves for years. The existence of simps should be proof enough that enough men keep catering to women and in turn making then expect that kind of behaviour from everyone. and BTW I'm not the op, I'm not chasing any dragon. I am a happily single man doing my thing. But that doesn't mean I am not reasonable or logical enough to realize that you can not neither man or women 100% all in one group and say ALL of these people are the same. Believing that is plain ignorant, even though j agree there aren't many women who are different."

1809,Impossible-asset,"Tomorrow is Valentines day. 

I call it Ballentines day, (an ENTIRELY underrated scotch, fellas. I mean no shit, its GOOD).

So I treat myself usually by getting dressed up, I buy myself a long-stem rose and go to a steak house. I'll have a scotch (most places have at least a couple good selections). And I'll have a big fat porterhouse. I have beer with my porterhouse. Good Dark beer. Then I pay my bill and leave. But heres the twist. I leave the OTHER rose that I dried over the mantle for a year on the table, and take the new one home to dry. I put it in the mantle over the fireplace to dry out in the coming year. Yes I do this, yes its kindof stupid, and I enjoy it immensely.

I take the bill for the evening and I total up the cost of the scotch, meal, and uber to and from the steakhouse, and then I double it and put that extra amount (I would have spent on a dste) into my stock funds to make interest in the coming year). 

It's a stupid ritual I've done for the past 10 years or so. It just reminds me of how short-lived a valentines day celebration can be, and when I look at the rose that's drying on the mantle, I think of the money that is making me interest instead of just being gone. 

Sunday I'll be getting myself a nice young Korean whore in DC for a couple hours to enjoy, my dose of eros for the quarter.  

Then I'll kick back with some more ballentines on the rocks, and some good english tobacco from my grandfather's pipe, and enjoy picking my guitar on the back deck and watch the sun silhouette the hills before dipping behind them. 

Love yourself. Treat yourself, have a tasteful reminder of what you walked away from, and associate it with your increasing wealth as you do something for your own, pure enjoyment. 

That's what I'm doing on ballentines day weekend."
