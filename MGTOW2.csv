And I‚Äôll admit it  was to have an area that I could entertain women.  Over time and a few shitty relationships I  started asking myself the tough questions and first was do I really want a women moving in or marriage for that.  I have always had a very low trust factor for women. And without going into it the lack of trust stemmed from some very criminal things by women, that no one would believe.  I wasn‚Äôt an INCEL, far from it, but after the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù I retreated and stopped dating.  And witnessed other warning signs with friends and coworkers .  So I asked those questions, do I really want to have a wife/women in my life to the extent of bring them home or marrying, and the answer was no, hell no.  So I bought a huge screen, cut a hole in the dinning room table to mount a tv in to play games with friends, decorated my walls with dragon heads, swords , and so on.  So now my man cave is my whole house and I vouknr care less what any women would say, because I‚Äôll probably be pushing them out the door to a cab.and I love my childish dungeon."

The compliment should be delivered in a certain tone of voice, given at the appropriate time. etc etc etc.  It's far, far more trouble than it's worth.

&#x200B;

Feminism exist today only as a function of censorship, and that is exactly why they try to paint you guys with that brush, to silence you and redirect from your argument.

&#x200B;

Look, I'm an MRA, but not MGTOW. I'm married, long term (I found a great one from a previous generation- well I may be MGTOW because I did go my own way), but the message is as clear as if it were a written like a flash burnt across the sky, and the only way it can be defended is by calling you ""misogynist"" or some other vile name so as to dismiss you and silence the conversation, keep people from looking up.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately there are too many women out there starting to agree, and as Dr. Smith stated, ""if men are not allowed to speak, I will speak for them"". I had a phone conversation recently with one of the most notable women in the MRM, and even she replied to my comment that ""I don't subscribe to women bashing"" with, ""well, society and women have a lot to account for"".

97,,30203forever,"And by ""family courts"" you mean the ""Divorce tribunals""? Because they're neither ""family"" nor ""courts"", IMHO...."
98,,30203forever,"I agree with what you wrote. Personally, I define feminism as the political movement of the sub-par females to leverage their vote in order to get their hands on the resources which they ""deserve"" but are not able or unwilling to get the traditional way (i.e. scamming the males out of their money under the current gynocentric laws). And they're using their phony ""victimhood"" because it helps greatly with that. The ""equality"" which the feminists are constantly harping about is actually the ""equality of outcome"" along the lines of: ""that woman was able to secure a good husband &/or job and  I was not; therefore, it's obvious that the patriarchy is oppressing me and I deserve to be compensated by society for being persecuted."" That's how the feminists really think and that's the very reason why you never argue with them: it's next to impossible to make someone understand something when their income depends on NOT understanding it. IMHO, the equality of outcome (i.e. communism) is not equality at all and I'm talking from personal experience, actually. As Aristotle said 2.5K years ago, ""The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal."" The feminism is evil in its most basic form and must be fought with everything we'we got because if it wins, the men will become the abject slaves, no doubt about it...."

102,,WildChad,"I have come to the exact same end conclusion that feminism, the way it trends, leads to re-introduction of slavery as it ultimately desires to have the power to arbitrarily call any sexual act a criminal offense whenever it wants - Only dictators are in the same position as the power they have is to command the hand of the law according to their will - In its completion this would reduce men to a slave class while women would be elevated to noble citizenry / master class, just like Ancient Greece and Rome had a slave class of sub-humans who were there to do all the work that could be exploited in any way on the whim of the master class citizens.


This is the end game agenda, even if not conscious one, of feminism.
In other words, even if well intended, this is the automatic final state if feminism does not meet enough resistance."
103,,DJ-Roukan,"You are not alone my friend. Most people have not heard a great many truths about feminism...because they have become so adept at the lie, have so much power, they can not only censor the movie, but the very fact that they did censor it.  They censor the truth, then they hide the truth, then they hide the fact that they hid the truth.

&#x200B;

Most people that I speak with on line, that still believe that feminism is about equality and not a hate group aimed at men, are so naive of the truth, have so little understanding, that it would take ten posts to bring them up to speed.

109,,DJ-Roukan,You bet. Glad to help.
110,,30203forever,">Maybe the femanuts try doing one of their ""studies"" on male Humor.

Not going to work because stupid people do not usually understand humor and hate the people who do (usually, the men). That's because the feminists are not only devoid of the sense of humor themselves, jealous of others who have it but are also very suspicious & fearful that people are joking at their expense (which is not entirely untrue...). As far as ""get a life"" goes, that's the core of the issue: they are feminists precisely because they can't get a life and NOT the other way around...."
111,,30203forever,"I saw that post an agree with that. In addition, the females want the right to reinterpret consent post-factum and sometimes years or decades after the fact. Case in point: the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. Not only that, they want their claims to be judged to be ""true till proven false"" and not the other way around (i.e. #BelieveAllWomen). In short they want the end of the Due Process but only in one direction because ""reasons"". I have a simple solution to all that mindfuckery, at least on the personal level. Do not engage with any ""regular"" women in the West. Avoid them like the plague they are. To me, they are all the property of the state, their real daddy-husband and I do not mess with the government property.... P.S. You're ""better"" than me because I reported, blocked that person & forgot about it..."
112,,DJ-Roukan,"and you are getting smarter every time I read you...

kidding of course, but dead on the money accurate."
113,,WildChad,"Oh yeah, I didn't even remember post-factum which is horrible.

In the worst case not only you'd need to record all your sex acts with women, you'd have to store them forever - And when it comes to the current practices of divorce courts, evidence for the man is often completely ignored by the judge - So practically you'd never be safe even with consent.

I think you are completely right about ending Due Process, which is currently in the process of being eroded for women just because vagina.

And yes, avoid all BP women in the West and gauge actively for these belief systems in any women you engage with in order to stay safe."

Politics should be on the sidebar as not allowed and I mostly could ignore the Freeper types on that sub but over time the stupidity just got under my skin.   Also, too many ""victims"" there.  Pretty sure I pissed some people off pointing that out.  Sure, things are somewhat stacked against men in our society, especially white men right now, but if you stand back and objectively look at things it is mostly background noise.   I will take being a white male in this society any day, we are NOT oppressed and if you have half a brain it is not hard to compete and succeed.   Thank god I am not saddled from birth with the crutch of ""victimhood"" like women and other groups are.

And I can say as far as ""MGTOW"" as a concept, probably 90+% of of guys on r/mgtow are just not there.   It seems more of an AA for men in pain dealing with redpill truths.    I wish them goodluck in their pursuit of ""mgtow"", its not for everyone thats for sure.   But FFS keep the reich wing political BS out of it.

129,,,"I left voluntarily. Too many self-defeatist foreveraloners that are not interested in self development. Not interested in sharing life strategies. Too eager to fall for the clickbait media. I've also been guilty of this in the past. It's very easy to get into the bitter loop concerning feminists. But brandishing all women as having the same agenda is just as stupid as a libtard saying all men are toxic. It serves no purpose. It brings nothing to the quality of your life. MGTOW subreddit in its current state is an echo chamber.

I've seen a conversion from when the incel subreddit got banned. Most of the MGTOWs who shared their wisdom are no longer on the subreddit. A MGTOW I met in London even calls them menimists and refuses to go back on there. A few good posters remain. But they are drowned out by the overwhelming outrage porn.

It's a sinking ship. And that's because visiting the subreddit leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. A hyper focus on the worst of female nature. The worst of society.

Men need male spaces though. Men need brotherhood. Is this subreddit got the markings to provide that? I'm not entirely sure at the moment. However, for me it's time to turn a new leaf. Get back to the original intention of MGTOW. It wasn't to shun yourself away from society. It was to avoid commitment aka marriage and anything that does not serve men on his path. It was to place your hobbies and interests at the forefront. To realise that you're more than just your biological imperative. And I kind of deviate here from most MGTOWs, I don't think hooking up with women is bad if you are smart about it. Essentially the first inception of MGTOWs were the single bachelor types. I think through MGTOW subreddit getting popular. With YouTubers echoing clickbait  like TFM reading out the horror stories of gynocentrism it's become a bastardised version of itself.

So much inexperience with those guys on there, as a 34 year old who has been through a lot with women, they became pretty transparent.  Got easy to tell who hadn't been with a girl and who had. "

135,,mcsimeon,I got downvoted to hell just for questioning why they would actively avoid women 24/7. Seems a bit like the old Braincells subreddit.
136,,Liquid_Leopard,"Well, I always wondered what you had to get banned from /MGTOW and I found out! Apparently, well thought out answers and trying to have an adult conversation with mildly differing opinions is all it takes. "
137,,yermanbob,"Just unsubbed at the same time as getting banned, apparently you can't ask why an idiot 20 year old got banned, I started to talk about the purity spiral and the creation of there own bubble vs free speech that I've seen kill many communities since athieism+

I predicted that sub will be going down within 18 months because they have lost focus on the welfare of men instead preferring to have a bitch fest at women. "
138,,xpillx,"I just got banned from mgtow lol. They turned into a fucking hatred incel group. The amount of man jumping on high horse and virtue signaling there is astounding. I dont know a reason why I got banned. I had many good convos there but I guess ban was for 1 comment in thread where guy was virtue signaling to others about not wanting to fuck that chick he posted that actually looked amazing to me. I suggested that he hates looks too much and maybe he likes a dick in a butt. These guys turn into sjw feminazi that try to control freedom of speech. I dunno maybe they will make safety rooms for those incels soon too. There is a difference in not liking some women behavior and just her looks...
"
139,,ArtDeve,I am relieved I finally got banned. /r/MGTOW is full of toxic and hypocritical incels.
140,,NYLON_G,"I challenged a so called MGTOW on his slut shaming of an Asian female. I asked the question why he was so concerned about something he had no choice over and no control over.

His response was to launch into a personal tirade about doing whatever he wanted to do. He then attacked me personally and to top it off resorted to racial attacks. This from a MGTOW who has never met me and doesn't know anything about me.

I am convinced that r/MGTOW has been feminised and corrupted by feminists and anti-MGTOW shills. To be banned from the subreddit for having a discussion about MGTOW while the racist idiot sits in there doesn't surprise me. The fact that a text if admin would take sides with a racist does surprise me.

Race has nothing to do with MGTOW. However on racist Reddit subredfits this is not only permissible. It is supported and it is promoted. I will not be going back into that subreddit even as a lurker. It has become a hive of scum and villainy."
141,,TimJohnsonIII,Got banned. No explanation. No reply when I questioned.
142,,,"Yes. I did. I've also been banned from r/IncelTears and r/TrueFemcels. I was going to give r/feminism a shot, but I absolutely refuse to visit that sub under any circumstances.

You either hate the targeted gender of those subs or get out. Reason and neutrality are not welcome.

Honestly, I'm convinced incels have taken over r/MGTOW. They're just so hateful and miserable over there. It's depressing. Do you know not one of those men have posted anything to honor Father's Day? They're so busy hating women they forgot to show all the dads out there love today.

HAPPY FATHER'S DAY TO ALL OF THE GOOD FATHERS OUT THERE!

150,,,What‚Äôs happening with the ppl being banned so much? Who‚Äôs running the MGTOW? It seems the ppl who are being banned are more MGTOW than not. I was just banned yesterday for no good reason
151,,13Heathens,"Apparently, this warranted a ban:

""True love exists, but it's super rare in our generation.

I know these older couple, pretty well off and retired at about 50? The dude fell sick and was hospitalized, they had the option to discontinue treatment as it seemed hopeless (and was expensive as hell). I would've pulled the plug tbh but the lady did everything she could to treat him; risking their retirement plans.

Thankfully, he didn't have to go through the full course of expensive treatments and they're now enjoy their golden years.

I found out that they were each other's firsts and both worked hard together to earn their wealth. Guy's not a chad too.""

Some guy responded with ""Go. Away.""

""Not sure why you're so hostile. If you disagree with me, we can have a proper discussion.

Think of it this way.

Getting a unicorn is like winning a lottery. It's so rare that you might as well treat it as non-existent.

But are there lottery winners? Yes.

Should I spend a lot of resources in trying to win the lottery? No.

But the fact remains that there are lottery winners.""

Same guy responded with ""Wrong.""

I reported the last one for low effort and got the banned message shortly."

154,,,This guy was saying OP‚Äôs dead brother (who had committed suicide) was a failure so I called him out and got banned when he told me to fuck off and I replied that he should fuck his anime pillow. Is MGTOW full of furries and anime queers?

156,,lordlahmacun,"I wasn't banned. I left myself. r/MGTOW sadly turned away from a supportive group for men who don't want commitments into a nightmare fuel of incels and alike. I am so disgusted with myself for actually falling for their misogynistic trap for months...

Well, i guess that's just another dialectic. My life prior to MGTOW was antithesis and MGTOW was thesis. Now it's time for synthesis."
157,,TigPlaze,A friend from MGTOW PMed me about having just gotten banned.  They gave him no reason why.  I made a post asking how someone can contest a ban in the event of a mistake.  My post vanished immediately.  This makes me think they have no interest in running MGTOW with integrity.  I invited him here to MGTOW2.
158,,Implausible-asset,"Yes I got banned from r/mgtow for ""concern trolling"" on my old account. Nearly all the karma I had was from upvotes in that sub, but they banned me anyways.

Yeah sorry no sorry, but when someone is complaining about not getting laid and is saying they're going to buy a gun and let fate decide, then yeah I'd say concern is warranted.

I'm hopeful that here I can see the good posts on how mgtow helps men be better at being themselves, keeps them out of the trap of the marriage contract, and provides cautionary tales based on our own learning experiences with women.

And mods for inevitable showing of the incels here, please hand out the bans like candy. Those fools are subreddit cancer."
159,,Tsukikoselenia,"Been banned because.. I have absolutely no idea, honestly. Not even incel-bashing, defending women, or anything like that (it really isn't my type), just a sudden ban out of nowhere, maybe because of a talk with a guy about how improvement is important but saying that hard work will always work is false, since this guy's posts got deleted? Who knows.

For a sub that wants to reach the 100k ans is so proud of it, randomly banning people doesn't exactly sound like a smart idea."

Shows you everything you need to know about them. Those aren't true MGTOW and if they are that cowardly on the internet, you have to wonder how bad they are in real life. That's also why that subreddit attracts the lowest quality posters, who mostly seem to want to brag that they have money and women chase them now, which is ridiculous. If you want to attract women that's the opposite of MGTOW."

179,,russpav,"This is the comment that got me banned 2 months ago. When they banned me I realized they did me a favor.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad others are seeing this trend and speaking up as well. I first subscribed to MGTOW because there were good articles about self improvement and building better habits. The trend seems more and more externally focused and less and less about self improvement.

Repressing others (individuals or groups) does not free my mind, it traps it in a negative feedback loop of anger, fear and resentment. All of which I want to let go of and put down.‚Äù"

186,,purge1,"Just happened to me, honestly I just thought to look up MGTOW on reddit and found out the MGTOW sub is filled with women hating incels. The thread was the guy talking on Facebook with a girl about that the dogs are better than women, because dog won't divorce you and dog won't take your kids, and asked her what is the womens argument and she said vagina, he was like ""mhm, ok, what else?"". And one of responses there was ""vaginas stink anywhere, I don't need your disgusting hole"" or something, so I responded ""is this sub just riddled with incels?"" And they proved me right, by banning me. Is that really what MGTOW is about?"

The moderators are not replying to my reply to their 'ban message' (although they said ""reply to this message to get an explanation for your ban"") ... so, it appears the mods on r/MGTOW are not doing their job in a timely fashion, or they are corrupt.

Now almost all of that helpful knowledge and sound advice is being clouded by articles and rants that reflect misogyny, and at times, pure black pilled hatred.

[Just out of curiosity, can‚Äôt this be applied to males as well? A lot of my mates are pretty promiscuous dudes and have had plenty of one night stands. So with this logic, are they no different from the women this excerpt aims to shame?

Not trying to ruffle feathers, just kinda curious on the stance about men that do the things MGTOW hate about women (cheating, sleeping around, using another person for any kind of temporary/ personal gain, etc.). I try not to keep dudes like that in my friend circle anymore,  I can certainly say I‚Äôve seen a lot of men do these things that women are so demonized for.  I‚Äôve certainly been fucked over by the opposite sex, but a lot of my mates have done the same to some genuinely nice women.

As a single male, I wonder about the MGTOW movement and if it is too extreme of an ideology for me. Don‚Äôt mind the GMOW part, since that is the life I tend to lean towards as an introvert, but I love my mother, and sisters, and have met genuinely kind women.]


Hopefully some of you in this sub can answer this without me being banned first. I‚Äôm looking for camaraderie with people who aren‚Äôt so relationship focused and driven by the need for someone else in their life to make them happy, but MGTOW might be too extreme or me."

254,,Memekip,"Yep

I'm all for male independence, but I feel that constantly going around in a circlejerk of hating women just proves that the people who hang out there are clearly not over it. Being one sided and keeping an eye out for only bad women which fit the narritive in your head is just asking to get into a toxic mindset imo: vicareously playing the victim of a minority of women who play the victim to take advantage of men

Well idk, either because I‚Äôm a chick or because I genuinely was trying to understand their logic- or both.. probably both.

I‚Äôm all for men feeling empowered without women.. but I found myself at mgtow because just like with ‚Äúman haters‚Äù, neither gender should be held accountable for the world‚Äôs problems, or an individual‚Äôs problems.. and I was wondering what kind of logic they use since it does seem they blame women for all the world‚Äôs problems.

I‚Äôd argue a lot of women‚Äôs problems are culturally pushed on women by other women, and same with men.

And also, I have more male friends than female friends... like the two genders aren‚Äôt strictly romance based... but mgtow makes it out to be just a biological reproductive thing between the genders.. platonic relationships are important."

I don't share the beef with feminism that a lot of MGTOW men believe that they have to have.  I know and understand that feminism, at it's core, is just as much about dismantling gender roles for men as it is women.  If I am to be honest, it was actual feminism that taught me self respect as a man and why I was compelled to a lot of the behaviors and concepts of myself, women and the world that I had, and that reason is patriarchy.  The same men who brag about how it's been primarily men who've created civilizations and governments are the same ones who deny the existence of patriarchy unironically and under the spell of cognitive dissonance.

It's ridiculous, actually.

I've been banned from dozens of subreddits, especially LGBTs, feminists, cuckoldery fetishists, adulteries, affair advices, cheating experiences, and I'm cool with getting banned from there, because they are my ""enemy"" territory, getting banned from there is EXPECTED.
but when i got banned from mgtow? hell no, i wasn't expecting that. i was a men's right activist and a mgtow commentator at the time, and i always considered manosphere my FRIENDLY territory (except PUA and Incels, we don't share much in common) but i never expected a BAN from mgtow.
the problem is, they won't tell you WHY they banned you and they'll never give you a SECOND chance ever again.
so if the moderators don't want to give a fuck about banned members, why should banned members give a fuck about them?
and again, they're NOT the OFFICIAL mgtow, as they have confessed it themselves in subreddit.

but after that, i can't trust any FRIENDLY territory anymore.

Basically the synopsis said the woman got away with the crime, she was released no charges.  But the article said she was re arrested, charged with multiple crimes, and was undergoing a psych evaluation.

1. Marriage is a raw deal for men. Everyone knows this. I dont want to subject myself to that kind of slavery.

2. Dating and girlfriends: Every girlfriend I've had has either cheated on me with someone who had more money or a better position in life. Monkey branching. I dont fault them for it now, it's just their nature. And I dont enjoy the feeling of a breakup when I was thinking everything was ok. Casual dating equates to more buying free dinners than romantic reward, and it's expensive I'd rather use those resources on my self. Also the breakup psycho factor. Consensual sex and turn into a rape claim that without any investigation at all can ruin your life. No thank you

3. Women in the workplace: I am 100% professional all the time, and make sure I'm never alone with one. A false claim to HR about touching her butt or her being offended by a joke  can have you out on your ass faster than 5pm comes on a holiday weekend. It's not worth the risk.

4. Day to day life: they only talk to you if they want something from you. And I dont want to give them anything. I want to do what I want to do.

And feminism redpills more men every day as they expand the welfare state and make the laws against men worse (TFM mentioned a woman who got away with stabbing a man, and another who got only 15 months in prison for being complicit in a man's death).

Conversely, having kids just makes one more future feminist. Because odds are good you lose the kid to a feminist wench, or the public school indoctrinates your kid, or college indoctrinates him. Kids are fine, as long as you adopt and homeschool him. Otherwise, he's probably fucked no matter how redpill you are"

You weren't ""genuinely"" trying to understand us. At all. No one bought your BS. And of course you're here portraying yourself as the victim of the banning that you yourself have initiated.

MGTOW2 is very humble and less interested in bashing women. I am open to discuss female nature, tactics, AWALT, but I don't hate them for being what they are. Its about us, not them.

Hating women makes them just as bad as the extreme feminists that hate men. The existence of one justifies the other, and perpetuates it.

MGTOW is married to the idea that you'll be happier without solipsistic women in it. But you become self-serving solipsistic yourself.

Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men. So what's the difference? Because all I see is men like this too. Especially MGTOW men who aren't interested in building community. I spent a year trying to build a community around MGTOW with users and they were never interested. All they want to do is moan about women all day.

MGTOW doesn't make you happy. Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving. Society as an whole has become too big. Where as men and women would thrive in smaller communities. There are too many issues just to blame it all on women. And as society increases so does its lack of empathy and the feeling you are just a number. So better to build small communities.

The fact that it's a community based subreddit that states to its members that it's nothing to do with community goes to show you that it is utterly self-serving. How is that any different than any woman or man you meet today in society?

MGTOW just plays into the narcissistic division segregationist society. It literally says, ""Okay society, you win! Now let me get my fill"" and instead becomes exactly what nihilist society wants in a MGTOW's own image.

How did I draw that conclusion? That chase of career. The chase for material. Elliot Hulse said it better that ""I'm with you MGTOW but you focus too much on the matter. The mother world. The material.""

And I believe he is right to some extent. There's no harm in bettering your career but if that's all you do and all you aspire it material, what is your legacy?

>Being self-serving doesn't mean I'm harming anyone else in the process

Not at all but its essentially why societies collapse. It's a communist-like mindset. And as the population grows into self-serving narcissism so does the utter disdain and divide amongst people.

>MGTOW has made me happier than I've ever been, so I don't know what you mean by that.

It's all about how it makes you feel. Which is the issue with this society. It's always self-entitled. Self-centered thinking about its own self. It doesn't want to better the lives of those around them. It is one degree away from feminism.

>Learning to not depend on anyone but myself for happiness is the biggest step I've taken in my entire life. The fact that there are shitty people from both genders has nothing to do with why MGTOW is still relevant.

MGTOW is relevant in a nihilist society. I've come to the conclusion its a way of coping and becoming just like modern women. Which only serves to divide and segregate everyone.

But you never see MGTOWs want to get together and build a community. All you get is, ""MGTOW is about your own path"" And being surrounded by self-serving entitled men just reminds me of a male version of feminism.

What beyond the basics of don't get married and be careful does MGTOW provide? There's no pearls of wisdom beyond a few YouTubers. Majority of golden posts are from The Red Pill and books that don't follow the self-serving approach.

And MGTOW can't even do what they set out to do anyway. They focus too much on negative female experience. They talk about women all day on MGTOW1 and how much monsters they are. They give women their power away by making them the boogeyman/woman.

Atleast The Red Pill aspires for community. Atleast it brings men into its fold and looks after them within their small community. MGTOW does nothing but worship the self. And that's how we got here in the first place.

So you can say MGTOW has helped you. Perhaps it has. But I didn't come here to serve myself. I came here for brotherhood because without it any community inevitably collapses. Just like the PUA community did.  Stronger together, divided we fall. And it will always be this way. A community without guidance is going nowhere.
"
567,,Impossible-asset,"One thing that is an important consideration when you are talking about the principle of ""AWALT"" (all women are like that). It is pointless to bring up ""NAWALT"" (not all women are like that), because unless someone is genuinely disturbed in the head, they will know that out of the 4 billion women on the earth, it is not even statistically possible that every single one will be an ""awalt"" type.

The whole reason that AWALT is even a saying is because there is enough of a risk in dating, relationships, and marriage today that AWALT is a reminder of a real danger you face as a man.

If I were given a 50 gallon drum of apples, and only 10 of them were poisonous, but the only way to tell the poisonous ones from the good ones is after I take a bite, I wouldn't be worried about what my odds are of ""finding a good apple"". I'd slap a big warning label ""DANGER: POISONOUS APPLES, DO NOT EAT"" on the side, and leave the whole thing out by the dumpster for trash pickup.

That's what AWALT is. It's a warning that engaging in an activity has many detriments, and few benefits. It's not a scientific statement.

Many guys get stuck in being angry after being on the receiving end of a ""poisonous apple"" when it comes to women. And so they choose to walk away from that in the future. Some stay angry, which is what I am hoping to help get them out of by having a sub like this where they can talk with other mgtow men about how they can move on successfully. The other mgtow sub is for staying stuck in the anger side of things.

What women do mgtow men want? well, depends. When it comes to marriage and cohabitation, the answer is none. For myself, I extend that to girlfriends, dating, and any non-professional relationship. Though some mgtow men are open to that."
568,,Deadpanpancakes,"Its not so much that there are a few ""good women"". I think looking at people through the lens of good and bad are too simplistic.

Also, people tend to delude themselves into thinking that they arent ""wrong or bad"" when they want to justify doing something that is pretty abhorrent. Im more concerned about the society around us that holds women to many double standards or the fact that theres sometimes no recourse for a man and nobody seems to give a shit.  You take the shaky moral relativistic nature of women and their selfish attitude and combine it with the male hating legal system and you get men opting out because it is the reasonable thing to do."

This is an out right lie. Having a woman does not make a man happy. If you are a miserable man when you have a woman you will just be a miserable man with pussy.

>It also paints every single woman as the evil out-to-get-men self serving instagram obsessed morons.

It does matter that not all women are evil as you say. There are plenty of evil women to go around and all it takes is one to destroy a man's life.

>Truth is whilst most women are like that so are men

This is the men and women are equal lie. Why? Because lets say you have 2 children, the one every time he does something wrong you punish and the other child you allow to do what ever he wants. Who do you think is going to be well behaved the child that was getting punished every time he did something wrong or the child that you did not punish when he did something wrong? It's obvious that it's going to be the child that was getting punished when he did something wrong. In our case men are being punished and women are being allow to go unpunished or get a slap on the wrist. Just look at
all the women that have falsely accused men of rape for example. When was the last time you heard of a man falsely accusing a woman of rape? There is no way men and women are going to act the same when women have the state backing them and men just have
themselves backing them. Also men and women are different so they are not going act the same. Men were the protectors and providers because men think others. Just look what happens when there is a catastrophe. It's men that jump into rescue others at a risk to their own lives.

>All they want to do is moan about women all day.

What this guy is effectively saying is if you're going way why do you talk about women so much. The reason men need to talk about female nature is because we are trying to help other young men not to fall into the traps women and society are trying to get young men to fall into.

>Both men and women are becoming utterly self-serving.

Obviously men are going to start becoming self-serving. What did you expect men to be generous when women are so selfish? So men should just continue to give and give and give while women continue to abuse men?

>Society as an whole has become too big

So this guy is into eugenics.

>There are too many issues just to blame it all on women

MGTOWS don't blame all issues on women. We know simps are also part of the problem too.

574,,drops_of_Sunshine,"Absolutely loved it! Most modern blockbusters lack the ability to connect us to the character, MCU and Star Wars (Disney) are so fast paced and filled to the brim with jerk-neck transitions and action that I find it incredibly hard to soak it in the way I could with movies from the early 2000s.

This film had a stillness to it that I particularly enjoyed, you felt each moment of the journey, you were uncomfortable when they were, scared, sad, you felt the emotions of the character on screen and when I walked out, I felt sort of somber, and reflective, the way I do after finishing a good book. 1917 used music effectively, there were lots of quiet moments, and some really beautiful shots as well, but I never got the impression the film was trying too hard to show off visually.

Went and saw it by myself, and very glad I did! I don't watch reviews or trailers, but apparently it's been hyped up. I've since recommended it to all my friends."

How the Anazacs wouldn't salute the British officers, how he got lucky when a shell obliterated all the men near him. The screams from no mans land during the night.

You don't need to embrace femininity though. We live in a time that people say you need to accept who you are as if that is unchangeable. I tried to just embrace it when I was a feminist and one day I looked at myself and felt like I was a caricature, that 'leaning into it' was just as much an act as trying to hide it.

There is a similar movement that says we need to accept our bodies as they are, but that isn't true. There are certain parts of you that you shouldn't try to force a change on, aspects that deal with your emotional well being and your happiness. But the way you pose, the way you speak, the words you use, how you dress, those are easily  changed things and more than one path can make you happy. These aren't 'who you are'.  These are just the cosmetics of behavior, things that can be easily changed to suit who you want to become."

With America's steady rise in popularity in terms of entertainment and politics over the decades, people all over the world have been increasingly made more ""western"", which translates into taking in all the bad points of being an american.

Even in countries like mine which couldn't be further from US, both geographically, and socially, you can see the cancer of western feminism creeping in and breaking society from the inside.

It's difficult to think where feminism is going right now, but for me, feminism as a movement became redundant by the year 2000. Hey, atleast you don't have to worry about fake allegations right?"

They are against feminism for victimizing men (and for being crazy), but just as strongly against removing things that give them advantages and power.  Such as legal preference in child custody and alimony and the stupidly easy divorce laws, etc.  And when I say ""legal preference"" I mean that the woman is by default the legal provider to the child and so there are actually men out there who pay their ex-wife child support even though the men in question have custody of the child.

Basically, most women who are anti-feminism are pro-girl power.  Which is feminism just without being openly anti-male.  Feminism = anti-male to get power, girl power = pro female to get power.  The power and privileges and dominance they want is the same, they just try to get it by being nice instead of by being hostile."

One of the my other trans friends is openly pro-Trump, who she sees as the only person who's crazy enough to stand up to the ""liberal"" left (her words, not mine).

On the larger screen there are groups like Gays for Trump who are definitely not aligned with #metoo folks.

As all of you know, there's a personal and professional cost to not being on board with these liberal movements. Especially if you're living in a large, ""liberal"" city, it can be very isolating for LGBT people to be vocal about their beliefs about these catchy-named movements which lack any substance.

I mentioned elsewhere that I do believe I got and still get special treatment. I despise that, but most of the time it's out of my hands. Those who know me will vouch for the fact that I don't seek it out.

I do think I can be metooed falsely. False allegations of this kind are usually made by people who are mentally unbalanced, and there is no scarcity of psychological issues in the lesbian community. I've had one very close encounter with something like that. I'd share it, but I feel I've shared too much identifying information already, and I don't want to get doxxed.

I'd probably get 50/50 custody ... unless my ex could spin my lack of support for feminism into something evil. I don't know, and I don't want to find out.

If I say that I don't think I'm capable enough for the role, people seem to want to ""encourage"" me (because women need encouragement?)

Luckily, the team I'm with right now, I'm fully certain that I'm a right fit for them, and they for me (at least till six months ago, when they hired the other two women). I know I'd be miserable if I were in a position I wasn't qualified or capable of being in, and I'd fight that tooth and nail. I take pride in my work, and I derive a lot of my self esteem from doing a good job at whatever I do -- I'd hate it to be taken away from me.

This is precisely why I'm against how programs advocating more diversity in tech fields are structured. It just makes everyone miserable.

Having said that, I'm sure I have received opportunities because I was a woman. The prominent one that comes to mind is that I funded my graduate studies partially off a women-only scholarship. I'm not sure how I feel about that. On one hand, I feel that if someone wants to pay money to a certain group of people, they should be allowed to do that.

A nitpick with how you phrased this: I think most women have no idea that MGTOW exists.

Women and **men** discount MGTOW when they initially hear about it because it goes against the current narrative: men should get married, or at least pursue women, so that they can be happy(!)

I think the kick-back against MGTOW is through a genuine desire to help men achieve happiness(!) by getting married. 'Won't you be lonely', etc. Painting it as though women hate MGTOW because it teaches men to put himself first is too broad a brush. Certainly some women might see it that way, but for the majority of women who hear about MGTOW: their criticisms of MGTOW are similar to men's criticisms."

What I predict will happen is either society will self correct completely, making gender distinction once again fashionable and even marketable. A push back mechanism against this gender neutrality. This could make this whole gender war just a cringe phase in our history. There's still room for ""Something in between"" in this.

Another possibility is the eventual elimination of traditional roles or behavior models attached to sex. This is the ultimate end game of this feminist agenda.

[And THIS time I really mean it!!]""* phase.

-
I've also noted that -- per both statistics on divorced guys, and my anecdotal observations of men in general -- THAT stage typically lasts anywhere from a month to about a year or so (maybe a bit longer if it was a ""brutal"" breakup or devastating divorce-rape) -- before they start ""testing the waters"" (flirting, eyeing up women to at least potentially ""date"" or ""hookup"" with, logging onto {or back onto} Tinder, etc)...

-
And then, in about 2/3 of the cases, within 5 years they're ""remarried"" again (in scare quotes because they MIGHT just ""cohabit"" instead, avoiding the official-legal paperwork, as if that will save their arse)... with **most** of the remaining 1/3 just taking a bit longer (possibly having one or more ""aborted midstream"" attempts at relationships that fell short of an actual LTR/cohabit/marriage).

-
Overall, I'd bet that LESS than 1/10 (~10%) of them **actually** manage to live the rest of their lives as *true* ""MGTOW"" -- they're just TOO habituated to either the sex and/or the ""in a relationship"" identity, etc -- and too ILL-equipped to actually ""go it alone."""
843,,EmptyRedCloud,">even my dad who knows nothing about MGTOW

Yeah my Pops told me on the phone the other day, while talking to me about my younger brother with 5 kids and a ex-wife/2 baby momma ex-GF's milking him for child support and giving him a bunch of drama that would drive any man insane.

""You can do anything you want. Blow a whole paycheck if you feel like it, because you're free. But you're brother is stuck. Them women control his ass now."""

He may not know the term, but he's apparently ""getting the message"" regardless."
845,,Frelsi_8899,"I view most women this way.

Here's an experiment.

Try to have female friends where the quality of the friendship is on par with your guy friends. Suspend any sexual desires, and just try to have a friendship.

It's when you start holding women accountable to the same standard as men. When your expectations of their behavior are the same as men, that's when you'll start seeing the core problems.

Most of them are psychotic. Most can barely keep an actual conversation. Most cannot escape their nature and cannot fathom you in any other context outside that of utility. Regardless of your best efforts to befriend a female with any hope of forming a normal friendship. Disappointingly you'll end up just being that nice shoulder to cry on.

You'll quickly fall into the stereotypical bullshit where you sit around listening to her relationship woes. Until she's vented enough, has a paradigm shift and now has no need for the dynamic of the relationship she pushed. So she will drop you.

Sorry to say this, but we only ended up in this shitstorm thanks to feminism. In our school days, we had it right. Most of us weren't friends with girls. We had a saying ""Chicks are for banging"".

I'm 42 now, and yeah I even have a few female friends. They're all ""normal"" by female standards, but when you get closer they're flakey, self-absorbed and frankly a bit insane."

Like just to debate that there are gender differences I have to disarm the previous points; which these points aren't even freaking real. It is exhausting...and a waste of time. We know next year will be even more ""topics"" created to slow the rational minds down."

What's worse, he was arrested for...wait for it, failure to pay child support. All of [this](https://youtu.be/U50gOUGQzLk) was for failure to pay child support.

And then the irony of it is that the ""new"" one they eventually pick -- choose or fall for or end up with depending on how you look at it/label it -- is often (and we're talking *blatantly/obviously*) ***cut from the same EXACT cloth*** as the one they just divorced/got divorce-raped by/were alternating between crying & raging & grieving over just a year or so prior when they were in their reactionary (faux-MGTOW) ""I'm DUN with women!"" stage/phase.

-
We're talking almost IDENTICAL... as in even down to their NAMES\*...
-
So they divorce and/or get divorced by *Louisa* (that bitch, can you believe she cheated with the NEIGHBOR, expected to be forgiven and for hubby to still be NICE to that neighbor?)... but then FF a couple of years and who do they hookup with and marry but a 2x divorcee (with kids and thus one or more of her ""ex/baby-daddy"" guys nearby), and she is named... wait-for-it... *Luisa!*

-
WTF? That's like trading off an old used Chevy because, well *""it got dented up in an accident""* and you just CAN'T STAND the idea of driving a dented up car (etc) -- but then going out and buying **another** old used Chevy, except one that's even MORE dented up because it's been in *multiple* accidents (and from the looks of it possibly even driven in a ""demolition derby"").

-
Moreover, while there usually ARE some -- relatively superficial -- differences (i.e. the first wife was a blonde, the second a brunette, etc) when it comes to voice & speaking pattern, inflections/accent, even general overall behavior & ""character"" of the person... DESPITE the insistence of the guy that ""this one is DIFFERENT from the other one""; the resemblance is sort of ""uncanny""

-
A half dozen guys that I know PERSONALLY (as in been friends either with them or with their families for decades) have followed that EXACT same pattern\*\*... it's to the point that I figure one can PREDICT (with something like at least, *if not better than,* 50% accuracy) both when and who (name/character) they WILL ""partner up with"" again in fairly short order.

-
**But to get back to YOUR point...**
-
Yes I'd say you're correct in that it is somewhere *around* if not ***more than half*** of the guys on various MGTOW forums (/r/MGTOW and /r/MGTOW2 especially) who follow that pattern.

---

And then, as you said at the end of your prior comment:

>>On the other had you have guys like me that aren't mad, we just don't give a sh!t.

EXACTLY.
-
Unfortunately... because MGTOW forums are virtually the LAST ""male space"" that allows such bitching *(sort of the same as why the guy being cheated on/divorced ends up calling his [never-married] BACHELOR buddy at 2AM*\*\*\**)* -- we end up getting painted with the brush of THEIR ""blue pill raging."" (And while **WE** calmly, coldly, objectively {and yes often a bit harshly/brutally} talk about the REALITY of female nature {and MALE nature as well, though that is often overlooked/forgotten}; **THEY** {recently or 'in the midst of' divorce/d guys) come in, repeat & exaggerate the points about WIMMIN... in an angry ""red pill"" RAGING-story fashion, bitch about their wives/gf's {especially the ""cheating"" etc}... and so the accusations of ""misogyny"" {which then have some validity}.)

-
Just like the ""incels"" -- the not only NEVER been married, NEVER ""fucked""; but *most often NEVER dated, kissed, or been even the least bit 'intimate' with a female in real life* -- who plop in, MISunderstand what MGTOW is about (often only imbibing and regurgitating the superficial ""meme-pic"" garbage), and thus contribute to the mischaracterization of the whole enterprise.

-
**The TEMPTATION** is to BLAME them... but of course the fault really lies with US (the true/actual/real ""MGTOW"" -- that is time-tested/proven as such); in that **we take PITY on these ""pathetic"" creatures** and let them into our ""clubhouse.""

-

---
\* Which I often have to wonder whether it isn't ""on purpose"" as a sort of safety/insurance -- I mean so long as the name SOUNDS the same, then if in some moment of passion (or memory error) they say their EX's name, well no one will be the wiser -- but regardless, it's rather WEIRD/TELLING that the guy who WAS married to ""Louisa"" ends up marrying a ""Luisa""; or likewise with other name-combos; the guy who divorced ""Cathy"" then marries a ""Katherine"" [Kathy], or yet again from Sarah to Sara, Susan/Suzzane[Susie/Suzie], Mari/Mary & even Marianne/Mary-Anne, Ginny/Jennifer[Jenny], Kristina/Christiana [Kris/Chris & even Krissy/Chrissie etc] and so on...

-
\*\* And there are other elements too: basically the DEPTH/HEIGHT of the ""RAGE"" and/or depression/crying that ensues... is a predictor, **not** of them *truly* becoming or following MGTOW, but rather the opposite; the MORE they rage (or cry, complain, etc -- same thing really) the MORE likely they are to ""return to the plantation"" for round #2 (and #3, etc).

-
\*\*\* Mainly because -- well not only do WE actually ""understand"" the situation (we've seen/heard it dozens if not hundreds of times before) -- but we're the only ones that will (or even practically CAN) actually TAKE their calls... especially at that hour of the day/night.  They DARE not call their other ""married"" buddies (assuming they even have such), lest they create further problems."
861,,EnigmaticRonin,"Yup, you can see this with Jordan Peterson, and I'm not even a fan of him, but just watch how his logical points are completely disregarded.

""That's nice you just showed evidence that there are gender differences, what about racism, and the fact that Donald trump is president and had an affair, why do you hate trans people?""

Over the last year I definitely see tiredness and bleakness wash over him. To me this reinforced my idea of ""shut up and do."" The time for talking is over. You want to help men? Mentor them, guide them, help them network and get jobs. No need to talk to anyone, that is what females do...sit around and gossip to get another being to do the heavy lifting. Men just DO...period but this is getting lost."

863,,DWShimoda,"> There was a statistic that said that female prisoners were more violent and more prone to violence in prison.

Moreover, the following:

>>Usually, at least from my own personal observations, the single mothers who are getting praised aren't getting praised for intentionally raising their children alone, but for doing the best they can to raise them alone because the man bounced and is not being a father.

That ""Usually"" there at the beginning tells me you have an inherent **prejudice** in this regard... one that you are NOT being honest about."
865,,Frelsi_8899,"The enabling aspect in all of this is that many people alive today are just living off the technological advancements of others. They do not have the intelligence to actively participate in this. They have no real social obligations either.

They walk around with a very limited understanding of things because they're so arrogant they assume anything outside of their sphere applies through their projective nature.

They also have far too much time on their hands and get deeply caught up in first world problems.

Now a subset of these due to their vindictive nature and misguided compasses are just in it to stir social unrest. Some even might believe they're doing good, but without the intelligence and foresight, they cannot fathom the deeper implications of their agendas and they have no empathy to begin with anyways.

They're a product of ""Princess syndrome"". They believe they're special, better than everyone else and always correct.

866,,,"I specifically said ""in my experience"" for that exact reason. You may have a valid argument if I implied this was a fact in all cases. However, I made it very clear that my statement was based upon pure anecdotal evidence. Why are you so determined to be combative over such a non-issue, anyway? In my observations, that, indeed, is usually the case. That's strictly *my* reality. If you've observed and/or personally experienced differently, that is strictly *your* reality. It doesn't make either of us entirely right or wrong, nor does it suggest that the scenario described in the OP is purely a fabrication that never happens. I was offering a different perspective on the point in the discussion which is based on a false premise; that all single mothers are proud to be single mothers and shamelessly flaunt such a status.

There are multiple causes of single motherhood where praising said mothers for raising their children alone is appropriate. The example I listed  in my original post is common in my community. Right below that is the father being murdered. Right below that is the father being imprisoned. All of these examples were caused by either the fathers themselves or third parties. The single mothers who manage to raise their kids alone when faced with these situations deserve to be encouraged for it.

On the flip side, single fathers get special attention as well because they go against a negative stereotype that fathers turn deadbeat when they separate from the mothers of their children. They also receive well-deserved praise if they raise their children due to the mother being an addict, imprisoned, or dead. There are many variables to these situations, and frankly, I find it crass and myopic to paint all single mothers with a broad brush because of this."
