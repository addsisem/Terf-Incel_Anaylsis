0,four_q,I’m dead at Timmy turner being someone’s transition goals.
1,bakeryfresh,yeah incel cringelords are pretty gross no matter what variety. Better keep validating them to be on the safe side though
2,olivetree08,Discovery: TIMs triggered when we use the word vagina. Ya know what? I’m triggered by your girldick. So stop saying it. It gives me... dysphoria.
3,Zalmoxis_1,"traaaans is a cesspoll of lesbophobia, misogyny, and pedophilia."
4,antonivs,"This is a woman discovering what many of the members of the ""gender she identifies with"" are actually like."
5,QueenRowana,"On average TiFs seem much more reasonable than TiMs. I’ve had some crazy Tif in my inbox, but not nearly as many as the Tims. 

This seems like a woman near breaking point. I hope she realizes (even more) the madness she is subscribing to and gets herself out."
6,2or3thingsIknow,I am sure she was banned in less than 2 minutes.
7,,Some sense coming to them
8,rodrigo_vera_perez,This sub has taught me that everybody has a breaking point

10,,"Thanks to a tip, I took a gander at r/actuallesbians, and wow - what an obnoxious cesspool. The TIMs apparently hijacked it, and are posting gross memes about eating out vagina, you know like “women” do - and the kind of gamer-anime-fandom garbage you typically see on incel neckbeard forums. Compare that r/truelesbians where the natal women had to flee. Quelle différence!"
11,Lookismer,Looks like someone is finally peaking. Give her a few more months...
12,marianep2001,I really feel sorry for trans men. All the info out there is geared towards trans women who seem to have a hatred for natal women. The true trans people are not hateful towards women. It’s only the men (trans women) who seem to despise us so much.
13,komaedan,"sorry i’m new to the gender critical community, what does TIM or TIF mean? i know its T.I.Male and T.I.Female but idk what the other letters stand for :("
14,,"It would have been hilarious if instead of the rant they had really posted the picture, with 'goals!' to see the response."
15,throwawaydjdjxj,"its not really incels. Most of them have GFs. It are sex crazed pervs. There is a clear reason why These are ONLY MtF trans that we have a problem with. Only men get so crazy perverted that they Transition. 

This does not happen to female’s. That’s why I call them real Trans. 99% of them are actually valid while 99% of MtF are invalid"
16,Nibbana0,"Sure, thanks to them we're ""menstruators"" now, great. I have more empathy and sympathy for them but as stated in another comment, they chose to be men and crave that male entitlement and privilege, they'll never have it of course."
17,Chunkeeguy,"Actually no, she was in /r/truscum talking about /r/traaaaaaaans or however many a's it has. The truscumers hate the transtrenders and fetishists."
18,pynkecho,That’s exactly what all this comes down to. Most ppl are happy to support the trans community til they start being authoritarian and rapey and making all these out of pocket demands. They’re gonna learn quick it’s not gonna fly with everyone just like Johnica Yaniv did.
19,Chunkeeguy,Trans-identified
20,TyrannosaurusTERF,There’s still time
21,bakeryfresh,Just because someone isn’t sex-crazed or perverted doesn’t change the fact that a person’s sex is immutable.
22,Tsukinoakuma,So... transitioning makes a trans person invalid? I don’t follow.
23,robroy10021,I think one of the privileges sought by TiF's who are attracted to males is being on the same equal playing field with their partner; they essentially transitioned from straight woman to gay man.
24,duck0kcud,"As a shortening, use r/traa"
25,,so tempted.
26,silverfox92100,A similar thing happened to me. I got banned from r/gay for saying gays and trans deserve separate spaces as they have different issues. They banned me for being a bigot and when I asked why they muted me
27,StatsDog,"My boss is a lesbian, very proud and open of it, and our local diversity champion. And she fucking hates how T was added to LBG. She is quite vociferous about the issue, and argues that homosexuality and trans issues are mutually exclusive: they cannot both be simultaneously true, and thus the axioms of the trans position are a threat to all that has been secured by LGB so far."
28,AgentOfBliss,I actually saw your comment. Wow. These people actually go on acting like not getting a date is equal to being under Jim crow. Bunch of softies. It's as if the only reasons they even transition is to be attractive to folks who were not originally attracted to their natural body. Pretty dumb.
29,2or3thingsIknow,Trans insanity has spread. They infiltrate and steal pretty much all spaces they do not belong. If they receive any push back it's because TWANSPHOBIA. Not because they are insufferable fetishistic narcs. They have way too much social capital. They use it to destroy the safe spaces others fought for because their whole movement is based upon appropriation.
30,Pugsnotdrugs411,"Got banned from TwoX for saying men aren’t women and defending a woman who was told she “had no empathy” because she was hesitant to be in bathrooms with biological males due to her sexual assault

These are trying times 🙃"
31,Santasmother87,"You got banned from a sub about gays for saying ""Im gay""

Wacky

Edit: well I guess its not about gays anymore but you know what I meant"
32,yaxxy,I got banned for saying “my vagina doesn’t need to be fair to penis”
33,cursorylight,"> removed comments: 42/84 (50.0%)

34,viper8472,"Literally sharing your own experience without telling anyone else what to do, and you got banned. Did they delete your comment too? What was the rule they said you broke?"
35,ingridded,"You’re homosexual, not homo***genderal***. You’re attracted to actual men, not these queers or genderspecials.

Anyway, don't post in LGB**T** subs or any of those social justice type queer subs. Find actual, good LGB subs. This sub is a good one."
36,HolunderHexe,They are a bunch of Homophobes camouflaged as woke.
37,,I think ‘T’ is a completely different issue from ‘g’ and I agree with you that physically I can’t imagine being attracted to a trans-man.

46,aforg07, [**r/LGBDropTheT**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBDropTheT/)
47,NerdBrenden,Like seriously. I thought my comment was pretty neutral. It wasn’t negative or attacking in any way. It was simply me stating my sexual orientation. Which is totally unacceptable to trans radicalists.
48,mushroomyakuza,">These people actually go on acting like not getting a date is equal to being under Jim crow.

Male entitlement. Actual women would never dream of responding this way."
49,noT99009,"I’m late. But EXACTLY. These people change their genders to “appease” to the type of people they are attracted to. Like how a woman would say “he’s hot, I wish he wasn’t gay”.   So why not  “change” your gender so that that gay person will now find you attractive. it’s also like fetichizing homosexuality, gay or lesbian, as many straight people do, men fawning over lesbians and woman fawning over gay men, especially with porn (I didn’t know it was a thing amongst woman, but a lot of that crazy yaoi is written by woman so apparently it’s a thing). Some of them go so deep into their fetish that they want to change their gender to actually live it."
50,aforg07, [**r/LGBDropTheT**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBDropTheT/)
51,Yesnomaybluurgh,"> their whole movement is based upon appropriation.

56,NerdBrenden,YES. FACT.
57,NerdBrenden,They blocked me permanently for being against some of the anti-trans hate that I didn’t support
58,NerdBrenden,I refuse. Even if it kills me.
59,NerdBrenden,Trans people are not my community. I was kicked out of my community by trans radicals.
60,duluoz1,"That's absolutely insane. A gay person getting banned from an LGBT group, for coming out as gay. What's going on?"

74,thicky_kemp,"Yup, it’s a blatant attempt at dehumanising and invalidating people who disagree with you. Ad hominem attack reveals a weak argument."

76,mushroomyakuza,"There will always be outliers. I guess I'm saying most men act entitled, most women tend to be deferential in comparison."
77,NerdBrenden,Yup. But jokes on them because I still won’t date a trans person lol
78,NerdBrenden,I don’t even remember. People were shitting in trans people and I was basically like “they’re still people. Even if I disagree with their stance on gender and sex”. BOOM. BAN HAMMER.
79,ingridded,"I remember there was a TIF who said a lesbian stating she's open to dating TIFs and that lesbians who are attracted to TIFs exist makes her ""suicidal"" because she ""fought so hard to be seen as a man"". Another TIF was kicked out of a gay sauna after men complained there was a woman there . If they want to pretend to be men that's fine. But leave gay men and straight women alone. You aren't a man and never will be."
80,Gayosexual,That doesnt sound Ike something you should be banned for. There’s plenty over there that support trans but still want them separate. There are trans people too. There’s plenty of hardcore gc though. We have been getting brigaded maybe they thought you were trolling.
81,NerdBrenden,I was deff not trolling. And I’ve tried asking to be let back in.  No response.
82,Gayosexual,That’s not right... I guess you’d have to make an alt
83,NerdBrenden,"Nah, not worth getting banned for ban evasion. I have plenty of other subs I participate i."
84,all_the_people_sleep,"It's so bizarre how adamant they are and how indignant they seem when challenged, like ""TERF""s are the ones who are proposing something extreme and weird and unpopular. They even compare people who don't agree with them to flat Earthers. 

I mean, the idea that a woman can have a penis has only started to gain traction in the last ten years or so, maybe 20 at the most, and even then, it's a tiny fringe that believes that. Almost everyone in real life, outside of twitter, reddit, and other online hangouts, just think it's crazy.

Yet they always act like they're stating the most obvious thing in the world and we're the ones who need our head examined. It has to be deliberate. People will believe a big lie more than a small one."
85,SunflowerDevyl,"Went to that sub, was disappointed and unsurprised that males are including themselves in a sub called actuallesbians."

Addition: I’m sure it’s supposed to be “satirical”. Yeah... I’m sure.."
87,LesbianPrincess-,">Poly + pan = confused slutbag

Ahh, how they see women. “Slutbags”.

Btw thanks for doing this lol <3 😹"
88,whydenny,Aah yeah.. The subreddit with the most ironic name. What else can you expect from them.
89,talesofkenji,I suggested that TERFs are not universally bad people and got banned. I’m wondering if this type of thinking is a trend or here to stay
90,yishengqingwa666,Nice work.

92,archpope,"I generally see Reddit as a sort of melting pot where people can participate in discussions, even of viewpoints they don't share. Some are better at this than others, admittedly. /r/childfree is okay with parents posting, /r/libertarian has no issue with socialists posting, this sub lets women post, &c., as long as there is a respectful give and take to the conversation and not just a bunch of trolling and brigading. I haven't even visited that sub yet, but if I felt compelled to strike up a conversation there, I hope they wouldn't be such severe gatekeepers that they'd ban me just for being a man, so long as I was respectful of their community."
93,BenLewisWaddington,"Yeah, exactly what I was thinking. All very common in those subs."
94,BenLewisWaddington,You're quite welcome! I'm banned for it but I think I used my one life wisely.
95,NotTransphobic,Do you honestly believe the person he was “mansplaining” to is an actual lesbian? It seems far more likely the commenter is either a TiM who wishes he could be a woman or a libfem who thinks you can call yourself by any sex and we all have to accept it despite the damages. My bet is strongly TiM.
96,LesbianPrincess-,"That entire space is FULL of straight men. That is why I personally “peaked trans”. The tipping point was when they told me that penises can be feminine, and that after 3 months of hormones, a penis starts to “smell like a girl down there” (their EXACT words), have different “mouthfeel”, and so on. You don’t wanna know the rest. 

I applaud this man. Someone has to tell them.

Edit: Also it’s not “mansplaining” to state the obvious fact that lesbians are females who love females. Even the dictionary will tell you that. Is the dictionary mansplaining? 😹 Or is it just correctly using a term that has been around for over a thousand years? 🤔 

I wish more people would give these TIMs a reality check. I hope real lesbians saw it and started questioning their shit."
97,,"Mate, trust me when I say real lesbians appreciate this work. Because god knows how tired I am to have to explain the definition of what being a lesbian is."
98,BenLewisWaddington,"A lesbian space, right. Except actual lesbians. Why are you defending a bunch of men who mansplain to lesbians about what it means? I'm by definition correct."
99,Thatlikesomething,"With the mansplaining though?????

Example of mansplaining: speaking when hated."
100,SunflowerDevyl,"My apologies if you misunderstood my meaning. I should say I was disappointed and unsurprised males calling themselves lesbians in a sub called actuallesbians. 

Its been an annoyance for lesbians to be booted from subs designed for them by saying things like ""women don't have penises"" or that they are not attracted to penises."
101,radleaning,"For some reason, all lesbian subs except for r/truelesbians include not only anyone who identifies as a lesbian, but every other letter under the rainbow as well! Like, why would it be wrong to have a ""lesbian only"" subreddit? I as a lesbian would be 110% okay with subreddits only for bisexuals, only for trans people etc etc. Why do the lesbian subreddits have to be inclusive of everyone?"
102,LesbianPrincess-,You did :D
103,BenLewisWaddington,"I checked the profile, it was a Pre-Op TiM."
104,,"Mouthfeel is a weird term, but this is the first time is has made me shudder.

Is nearly as gross of a statement as all ththe tweets telling radfems to choke on ladydick.
Seriously something broken about the critical thinking there.

Christ. 


I stopped invading the feminist subreddits. <am straight married man> I had forgotten the anger for a minute at the shit that gets told.to women."
105,,[removed]
106,LesbianPrincess-,"No. It’s trying to explain things to women when women’s perspectives and experiences about themselves are more accurate. However, definitions of lesbianism and homosexuality are objective and universal. It’s not just his or any man’s opinion. 

It has nothing to do with “being hated”."
107,archpope,"Ah. I understand now, and agree. I suppose to clear it up you could say TIMs, but I understand now so no need."

109,archpope,"I can't think of a good reason not to, though the pseudononymous nature of Reddit would make it pretty easy to crash, unless you locked the sub and had everyone submit proof to a mod.

But I get what you're saying about ""inclusivity,"" though most of it seems like virtue signaling to me. ""Yeah, our group is just for lesbians, but we don't want to get attacked by the other lefties, so we'll let pretend lesbians in as well."" And this is why the right is so fond of saying ""The left will eat itself."""
110,SearchLightsInc,Pretty sure that poster derailed one of my posts on bad womens anatomy by first commenting that i was a terf because of my post history. Guess they really dont have anything better to do.
111,archpope,"Calling a man who identifies as a woman a ""trans woman"" is allowing TRAs to control the narrative through what amounts to newspeak. Granted, this is an incredibly common tactic, e.g., Pro-life, anti-immigrant, &c., but one that, especially in our own spaces, we shouldn't give in to."
112,BenLewisWaddington,"Thanks for your opinion, it is noted but not cared about. Flat earthers are mostly harmless, the other is coercive. All I was doing was highlighting the absurdity of a group called ""actuallesbians"" that denies the fundamentals of what it means."
113,LesbianPrincess-,"I’m a lesbian. I love what he did. I wish people would do it more often. These assholes need to be called out. I think it’s fucking hilarious, and honestly, it kinda made my day. Lol.

Btw going to a LESBIAN SUBREDDIT and saying that lesbians don’t have penises is NOT like your analogy. It’s seriously stating the obvious. Lol."
114,LesbianPrincess-,"They don’t want women to talk about our anatomy, but they will discuss ad nauseam about their own mutilated penises, atrophied “girl dicks” and bodies. It’s so gross."
115,NotTransphobic,"I’m fine with “trans woman”. I just feel the “trans” part is a necessary descriptor. He’s not a woman, never will be. If he doesn’t invade or erase women’s spaces, and can acknowledge his biological sex, I’ll call him a woman if he wants me to. I don’t have to believe it, but I’m not trying to hurt feelings for no reason. This guy though? Yeah, he’s asking for it by coming into actual lesbians with his bullshit."
116,SunflowerDevyl,"Ironically, actuallesbians is mostly TIMS and bisexual women. Lesbians aren't welcome there."
117,NotTransphobic,That’s so damn gross.. so what TwoXChromosomes became all over again? It almost feels like GenderCritical may be the last holdout for ACTUAL women.
118,brinkworthspoon,I don't see any issue with allowing bisexual women
119,SunflowerDevyl,"Yeah, there are very few subs left for women only, actualwomen and gendercrital being the most prominent."
120,throwpatatasmyway,Truebutches and truelesbians are a thing. They're pretty chill.
121,LesbianPrincess-,Yep! Hit the nail on the head there.
122,dickolaspatrick,"The irony is that the sub is called actuallesbians and there are no actual lesbians there at all. A bisexual woman is not a lesbian. That isn't to say they're not ""valid"" or whatever. Just you expect a sub with that name to mostly be lesbians. Now I'm just being redundant."
123,DoubleXcrew,"Truebutches is quite pro 'transman' though. It treats 'transmen' as another, higher, form of butch, which they aren't because butch is about masculine women not women who want to be called men."
124,brinkworthspoon,"Right but I don't know what can be done about that realistically speaking, there are more bisexual women than lesbians by a great margin, and a lot of issues affect both groups so they are more often than not lumped together. You could make a rule saying ""no posts that express or imply an attraction to men"" but I think anything more than that would cross reasonable limits to community policing"
125,throwpatatasmyway,"What.  I typed in transman, transmen, ftm in Truebutch and I didn't get anything like that. Are you talking about the same sub that I am. You might be talking about Butchlesbians. That sub jumped on the trans agenda train a short while ago."
126,Thatlikesomething,So they banned the one moderator who was gender critical. And happened to be the only female. Why don't they just change the sub name if the men no longer support the basis of the sub? Isn't that false advertising?
127,moonflower,"Yeah, you probably won't get away with that - I was banned for saying that male reproductive organs are male - I was disagreeing with someone who insisted that his dick was a female dick - they don't have much tolerance for basic biology over there"
128,Ramsden_12,"I got banned despite not being subbed, nor ever posting there, which I think should constitute harassment really. I had no intention of ever posting in a sub reddit misogynistic enough to believe female is a feeling or sex work is a choice."
129,__KOBAKOBAKOBA__,"For TRAs and their liberal wokeness entourages anything less than active trans ally circle chanting simultaneously whipping your cis back in solemn self-flagellation is a declaration of war and ban, dox and flame-to-death-worthy and, unless you're a man (whoops), physical attack worthy pretty much. Won't have it any other way than theirs, such resolve and madladdery, ah boys will be boys."
130,,"I really do not like the direction Reddit and the Reddit community are taking with regards to free speech. For example I saw a post at the top of the front page where everyone was applauding Twitter for banning a woman over racist comments. I hate racism, but I have to say, seeing that really gave me pause. This website was founded on the notion that anonymity would allow their users to speak freely. Acceptance of free speech should be in our DNA. Instead, everyone everywhere seems to think it is totally ok to ban dissenting opinions and people who have them. It really sucks."
131,Thatlikesomething,Any clue on who the female mod was and if anyone's tried to get her to join GC boards?

139,Lifeisstrange74,"You know, this got me thinking a horrible thought.

Sex Ed may one day become “Gender ed” where they teach kids that men can give birth too and that women can have penises too."
140,citrus_slinger,"Didn't you know that sticking up for biological females rights and not wanting them to be exploited for sex means that you're a violent bigot?

This shit makes me so sad to think about. I consider myself very progressive, but the social justice left has gone off the deep end and are closer to fascists than the progressives they claim to be."
141,twoXfeminist,I actually think that the mods stalk GC subreddits and ban any users who post in them.  I’d love to take the issue up with Reddit since that’s apparently against the rules :)
142,BenLewisWaddington,I came to Reddit after having my 11 year old Twitter account suspended for saying women don't have penises. It better not spread to that degree here!
143,kitsandkats,"You don't need to ""get"" me, I'm already here!"

145,Thatlikesomething,One of the commenters in this thread provided a link to see the censored comments. It took awhile to read through all of it but they put it out there that the only female mod in XX chromosomes was banned for her opinion on men in women's sports. Despite how friendly to opinion and discussion they present themselves as.
146,throwaway275445,I feel that should have gone to the front page multiple times but this is the first I've heard of it.
147,moonflower,It's pretty amazing to read [all the mod-removed comments on that page](https://snew.notabug.io/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/axe6pd/you_are_welcome_at_twoxchromosomes/) ... quite sinister to see how far they have gone to silence every hint of dissent
148,moonflower,"They are already teaching young children that females can be boys and males can be girls, so I suppose they will soon remove all gendered words from the sex education books, and talk about 'people with ovaries' and 'people with testes'"
149,Ramsden_12,"Yeah I don’t know where the term ‘SWERF’ comes from, given that most people who campaign against sex work are or were sex workers themselves.  I didn’t know that much about sex work until I read an article by a prostitute in New Zealand and then I started reading more articles by prostitutes and women who’d escaped from that industry.  I was absolutely horrified! What these poor women have to go through...  honestly it disgusts me that there are wealthy women who describe sex work as a choice.  Do they have no empathy whatsoever?  If it’s between being raped or letting their children starve most women would pick the rape.  It doesn’t make it consensual. 

As for trans rights activism, I was always skeptical of that.  I got into feminism through reading delusions of gender, and as soon as I realised gender was a regressive and oppressive social construct, I couldn’t really have sympathy for a bunch of (mostly) wealthy white men who were claiming they had an innate gender identity.  Then I read about their abuses of the lesbian community, the attacks on women from self ID in toilets/changing rooms/prisons and their stealing of sporting achievements from women/girls and I was pretty horrified by that too.  Not to mention how they straight up lie about their murder and suicide rates, which is pure narcissism."
150,Ramsden_12,"There was a post about that subreddit on GC that I commented in.  I think they definitely went through that thread and banned everyone, it was a little while ago.

Today someone on GC referred to a post on Two X so I decided to check it out, out of curiousity.  I always like to check to see if I might be wrong about things.  On one post I saw someone call SAHM 'leeches', I saw people suggest that equality was a 'lifestyle', no more valid than other 'lifestyles', I saw people suggest that boys and girls are fundamentally different and should be socialised differently - girls ought to do more chores, while being careful not to say no to men or become 'leeches', boys don't have to respect women if they don't want to.  This is all allowed, for some reason, but never posting there and posting in another sub that TIMs should stay out of women's sports is hateful enough to warrant a ban."

155,pilikia5,"Daaaaaamn, the layers of bullshit there: 

TIF: “A lot of people forget that most trans men lived as women for a significant amount of their lives, and whilst transitioning to male can reap a lot of male privilege that cis and trans women won't ever know, it doesn't discount that the harassment and mysoginy we experienced pre-transition is not forgotten- and it's something that cis men will never hope to understand.”

“...that trans women won’t ever know?” I was with you up until then, commenter!

The TIM insistence that they never, ever experienced ACTUAL male privilege—because, like, they internalized society’s misogynistic beauty standards—was another major peak for me. Privilege doesn’t give a fuck about your super-special inside “identity,” dude. You still reaped all the million tiny social, interpersonal benefits—and you’re completely ignorant of what those even were! That’s what makes it PRIVILEGE. 

Just another way men can tell us how much more special and oppressed they are.

ETA: Not to mention the inherent hypocrisy in the idea that TIF are socialized female but then opt into male privilege—but the reverse can never happen with TIM, who were born REAL FEMALE WOMEN"

178,RogerStormzy,"I think it's really because of the prevalence of what you might call ""doublespeak"".

Like we all (mostly) know sex and gender are different. One's biological, one's social in nature. But we still say things like ""Select your gender"" on web forms because we've been puritanically programmed to not bring up sex in polite society. Even though you know we don't mean the word sex in a sexual way.

Even now that we don't really care about puritanical social values, the conflation between sex and gender still exists. The truth is that we nearly all understood ""woman"" as ""biological woman"" until this conflation was brought in with the trans movement. Now they're using ""woman"" to refer to some type of social construction rather than biology.

So it's not enough to just be okay as a feminine man or masculine woman. Now the push is for everyone to accept this change in terminology and ideology as unquestionable fact. And once people agree with the conflated terminology, you can't really have an honest conversation about it. You just don't have the linguistic tools to do it.

Honestly it's kind of fascinating to think about how much this doublespeak exists in society. Like there's some Tumblr post about respect vs. respect on one of the GC subs. Like how respect can mean ""basic human decency"" or it can mean ""submission to authority"". And how people conflate the two meanings to say ""If you don't submit to my authority, I'm not going to show you basic human decency."" I noticed this a long time ago but didn't really have the words to express it. I noticed it with police apologists mainly but it fits so well in so many other places too.

I was arguing with a guy today about whether or not the phrase ""transwomen and biological women are two distinct categories of things"" was transphobic. Naturally it is.

Imagine the insanity necessary in humanity to not be able to at least admit that a woman born as a woman is *different* than a ""woman"" born as a man. As if the mere acceptance of this obvious thing makes me somehow hateful and bigoted.

The other arguments I got were largely about assuming I run up to trans people on the bus and scream it at them. Like, nah. I have opinions and I want to discuss them with people. If a trans person wants to know my feelings, I'll tell them the truth. But otherwise I'll assume they disagree with me and not bother arguing. 

I really only desire a discussion with other non-trans people like me. Both because I want to convince people of my opinion but also because I'm willing to adjust my opinion in light of a different perspective. Though I'm happy to talk to trans people about it if they would like. I don't want them to think I'm hating on them. I like a lot of them as human beings.

193,JimmyNeon,"> I read some where that some languages don't have the sex/gender split

Can confirm.

I am Greek and the only term we have for this refers to ""sex"".

When I learned English I was even taught that sex and gender are synonymous and that gender was just a more appropriate/politically correct term in conversation.

201,-cub-,"this reminds me of an email conversation i had about 15 years ago.  this british guy was working in games tech somewhere in canada, and complained about a male co-worker getting accused of sexual harassment.  his p.o.v. was that his friend was innocent, so i went with that, and sympathized, as i, as a woman, had been falsely accused of something else in a work situation, and i let him know that if ""they want you gone, they will find a way,""  meaning that if we assume Mr. Friend is innocent, the PTB knew the easiest way to get rid of him was this way, and that's too bad; conversely, if they really wanted to keep him as an employee, they'd find a way to keep him on even if he were guilty, b/c that is how corporations operate.

well Mr. Expat did not find my input comforting i guess, as he really wanted to lay into sexual harassment as a topic.  this was a bad move on his part, and i let him know that every woman has experienced mild to egregious exposure to some form of sexual harassment, and if he wanted to, he could act as a leader and an influencer to the younger men with whom he worked by not reinforcing their behavior and mindset with regard to women.  at this point, this man no longer wanted to correspond with me, go figure."

For example, the end result of all of your prescribed steps to being of use are all basically worthless except inasmuch as they impress upon women that men are not all lost and that they therefore are not all doomed.  You aren't going to change any laws, affect the economic structures, or alter the corporate media and culture's misogyny with any plays from that book- you are just going to offend some dudes and impress some ladies.

Example:  in almost every city in America, there's a major street that was re-named for MLK.  But some of the old timers will ""accidentally"" refer to it by its former name.  If you call them on it, they plead old age and habit.  If you don't, they figure they're among friends and later they'll whip out some other racist crap.

As to the transcult, we need women's eyes to see the problem.  We cannot tell them their rights and spaces, we have to listen to their accounts of the violation of their rights and spaces.

Be cognizant of the space you take up and the amount you speak in any setting. Don't dominate conversation(Fight that male socialization).

BELIEVE WOMEN when they tell you a given man is shit.

Decline undeserved opportunities. 

If you have any sort of disposable income, use it to better the lives of women around you (donate to women's causes)

>be the guy that shames sleazy friends from sleeping around.

Law enforcement deals with this all the time; domestic violence calls are dangerous and unpredictable.

You weren't even using the word literally. To literally lead means to physically go somewhere and physically have people follow you. Being a leader in the sense of influencing other people's actions is already a figurative sense of the word.

I am a mediocre man. Probably less than mediocre. I have accepted this. Can you? Can you conceive of another person being useless without holding them in contempt? I have accepted that I will never find love, either relational or physical. Can you accept that about me without finding me contemptible? Probably not. You almost certainly evaluate a man's value by his sexual prowess, and regard failure in that realm to be proof of contemptibility.

Mediocre failures exist, and I'm one of them. People don't look up to me for inspiration on how to act. Will you blame me for my mental illness and failure to cope with it? Yup. But you won't look at it that way. It'll just be you being ""realistic, telling me like it is,"" just like Donald Trump."

Necessary for actually listening and bonding between the sexes. We live in an age of creeps, inceldom and porn addicts that treat all women as sexual conquests or sexual gate-keepers. I'm advocating for platonic freindships wherein the woman doesn't have to deal with being hit on, without politeness being misconstrued as flirting, without having to let the guy down gently or explicitly, or worse, having to endure sexual harrasment in fear of violence if she rejects him.

Sleazy friends have the same restrictive view of women, but may have the social skills and charms to lead a woman to bed and nothing more. Maybe they just have a few PUA lines memorised and an inability to take no for an answer. One night stands are fun, but not every woman appreicates the fuck and dump. It breeds an unhealthy attitude that treats women as sex objects and ruins the esteem of women. Imagine every partner fucking you and then ghosting you. Meanwhile, the man remains emotionally stunted and immature, unable to foster genuine relationships with women.

These are symotoms of a general sexual neediness amongst men, a neediness that is created and exaserbated by male socialisation, mysogyny and porn use."

So no... I don't evaluate male value by sexual prowess. Sexual prowess is meaningless and unrelated. 

And I wouldn't put sex on a podium when I return to the dating scene either.

You said men should take pride in having platonic friendships with women. That means you think its a somehow notable or prideworthy thing to have just because they're women. That's putting them on a pedestal and gives off weird 'nice guy' vibes. 

The contradiction is following it up with saying don't get creepy, because you've just said to do something creepy. 



You're also perpetuating incel myths of everything being seen as sexual harassment by suggesting that men shouldn't attempt to initiate relationships with women they're friends with. 

If you get on well with someone, and you're attracted to them, not only is it not wrong to attempt initiating a relationship, its a normal common thing and is how most people meet their partners. That's how you foster a genuine relationship. Its crazy to suggest men shouldn't do it."

I must be some kind of scumbag, because women wouldn't date a scumbag. 

But I'm making a feminist argument. You hold deeply patriarchal values which tell you that if a man can't get laid, he's worthless, even blameworthy. If a man is unable to attract sexual partners, he isn't eve valid as a man. That's profoundly sexist.

You can't conceive of a man being unable to find someone to love while simultaneously also being innocent of any wrongdoing. And that is the height of patriarchal thinking. Good men get women. Bad men do not."

But seriously now, I don't even have a framework for seeing a 6th month dry spell as something to feel bad for someone for. I wish I could; I'm a naturally empathetic person, but I just can't.

I feel like men are stunted because they aren't allowed to express their emotions with anyone but a sexual partner.

Maybe you need better psychological help to boost your self-image.

Edit: FYI, I don’t happen to agree with society’s ideals of what’s “attractive,” so this is not meant to bash TIFs or GNC women. Men are  lucky because SOCIETY judges us as being more attractive than masculinized females by default, not because it’s objectively true.

278,,"My point is that even with their suffering, TIFs often show more strength and positivity than the biological men who complain about being “forever alone.” I think this stems from the emotional labor expected of women, while as men we are socialized to feel entitled to whatever and whoever we desire.  I’ve also heard some amazingly successful detransition stories of TIFs who are able to recover, thrive, and have healthy relationships, despite having irreversible physical changes that make it hard for them to pass as female, while TIMs who detransition, despite being able to go back as male-passing with little effort, often wallow in self-pity.

Have the basic modicum of respect for your health and your body, by cleaning it and using it.   


There are far too many women who have to teach adult men that they should brush their teeth every day, despite parents teaching kids this as they grow up. There are far too many women who have to ""encourage"" adult men to move their bodies, even something as simple as walking up and down the stairs to do some chores, rather than sitting on the couch or staying in their gamer chair all day without prompting.   

Do these very basic and reasonable things for yourselves. Being presentable isn't only about ""attractiveness"", it's literally for your own well-being. Women just have the burden of asking adult men to do so, and are judged for how they execute the unrequested responsibility.

I'm not sure that it is. Certainly if you read the rules, it doesn't say that. I've posted comments there a few times without criticism, but not *usually* about my personal experience as a man. The description in the sidebar of the subreddit is ""women-centered"". That implies that a top-level post about a man's experience is off-topic.

It doesn't mean you aren't allowed to comment there, if you aren't posting the usual self-centered NAMALT and other stuff that goes through many men's heads when they discover that a space exists that's not all about centering them.

> So it is unfair of people to assume I had ill intent. 

No offense, but this comes from you being self-centered about this. There are plenty of people with actual ill intent who try to post there, and no particular reason that the people who spend effort defending the space should try to distinguish intent.

Yes, in a perfect world, people would just enforce rules like that neutrally, without personal attacks and so on. Then again, in a perfect world a space like GC shouldn't be necessary. Again, you need to keep in mind what people there may have had to deal with in their own lives."

348,Thatlikesomething,"There is a Spa in the town I live in. It's been written about in some high profile magazines. It's a big deal. Someone just recently mentioned it in conversation to me and I, being skeptical that it's worth all of its buzz, decided to read the reviews on Google maps. Does anyone else read Google map reviews before you go anywhere? Sometimes it's been a helpful deciding factor for me.

Anyway I think you all should just look up any local spas in your area and read the reviews. Because apparently trans people are all curious about one thing concerning the spa in my area. ""WiLl ThEy ToUcH mUh QuEeR BaLlS?"" 

I mean something is really disturbed when you leave a review when you haven't even been to place to express that you're curious about going but are hesitant because you're trans, but you really, really, want some ball cleaning action."
349,KendallMintcake,I saw some of the tribunal on YouTube with Yaniv claiming he has both a penis and a vulva and it was the vulva he wanted waxed. Sure Jan. Obvious lie is obvious.
350,throwaway275445,But he got his period at 13!
351,Minimalist12345678,Megan Murphy and Lyndsay Shepherd both got perma-banned from Twitter for saying something along those lines.

353,riotousfem,He's obsessed with preteen/teen girls and their periods and trying to organize a topless lgbt 12+ swim with no Guardians present. He's something.
354,Peach_Muffin,"I don't think that the two are really comparable tbh. I'm gay, and find it a huge pain having to Google ""gay friendly hotel"", ""gay friendly venue"", ""gay friendly spa"" and so on (my partner and I can get refused service at any of these places where I live due to religious freedom laws). I would love it if I lived in a world where I didn't get kicked out of somewhere because I forgot to add ""gay friendly"" before an organisation's name while researching the place. If you hate gay people then just... Hold your nose and pretend that we're just good friends, or something. On the other hand expecting an esthetician to be able to wax a body part that they've had no training on is completely unreasonable, it's like asking an electrician to do your plumbing. Further you're forcing women to interact with a penis or face legal repercussions for doing so, which seems like state-mandated sexual assault."
355,ThinkWithYourV,"I once saw someone explain it as, ""You can refuse service to Steve because he's an asshole, but you can't refuse service to Steve because he's gay (or whatever other demographic)"".

390,Charon2525,"Transwomen are men. They should compete in the men's category.

A transwoman who's been on hormone therapy for 2 years is a man with a deliberately compromised endochrine system, not a woman."
391,Thatlikesomething,"Well it's like a decision to become a parent. I know. I know. But wait a second. If you decide to take on the responsibility to become a parent you have to put your dreams of taking that backpacking experience through Europe on hold. I'll give another example if you feel like going down the ""well men force women to raise kids so it's easy!"" Okay. Second example. You want to be a traveling singer on the road? Well you might have to cut hold off on that dream of having a backyard and picket fence for a dog.

Every life decision requires some compromise. Like cutting your dick off to finally get treated like a woman.

Edit: I'm pretty pro-choice on the matter of trans. I believe you should legally have the right after you turn 18 to seek a professional doctor to receive the formal therapy and thorough information about the weight of the decision. But just because I believe if a person can do it if they want doesn't mean I believe it truly makes them the opposite sex. Not really my business. But I will argue the fact that you're not really a man or really a woman if it comes up."

394,alistairtheirin,"Trans women are biologically male, but in all other senses are female. What the fuck is wrong with you? Why do you have to invalidate others’ identities? Do you understand that your ignorance is the reason why suicide is so rampant within the trans community?"
395,archpope,"Sorry, that was an Autocorrect mistake. I meant ""delusion,"" not ""decision."" But most of what you said is still true, except cutting one's dick off doesn't make that person a woman, and no one is under any moral or legal obligation to treat him as such."
396,Thatlikesomething,I'm all for people getting sexual release so long as it is not pedophilic or rape.
397,Charon2525,"Biologically is the only way a person can be male or female. That's it. everything else is magical thinking or sexist stereotypes.

Do you know what causes trans suicide?

1. Untreated mental illness (educate yourself on comorbidity)
2. The despair that results from the realization that you've permanently damaged your body in the pursuit of an impossible goal

So when you tell transwomen that they really are female, you're pushing them away from examining the underlying cause of their distress while supporting a delusion that's bound to traumatize them when it comes crashing down.

People like *you* are the ones who are driving trans suicide, you psychopath."
398,DevilFlamingo,"Would you be singing that song if a white politician claimed to be black, because that's her ""identity""? Think about you're saying. ""Trans women are biologically male but in all other senses are female"". What senses are those? Let's compare that to Rachel Dolezal: ""I was born white but in all other senses I am black"". What  does that even mean, lol? And this is keeping in mind that sex is far more biologically present than race is (which is basically just differently-coloured humans rather than clear differences between the sexes). 

No one's identity is beyond question, sacred, or someone untouchable. If you go around claiming to be Thai and you quite clearly don't look like anyone from Thailand, people are going to ask questions. The same is true of gender ID. We're not responsible for the suicide of anybody. We're just saying that men cannot become women nor vice versa, regardless of how anyone might identify due to their gender dysphoria.

It is unfortunate that people have such issues, but we cannot validate something that isn't true: presenting as female doesn't make TW anything other than men (biologically male adult humans), just like Rachel Dolezal is and was always a white woman claiming to be black because that's her ""identity"", whatever that means."
399,Thatlikesomething,Being treated *like* a woman. That's all I'm saying. I'm not implying it makes them *become* women it gives them the opportunity to be seen and treated as such. If that's not good enough for others to say it's fine for them to go into the women's room I don't know what will. But I'm certain after that point most people won't argue.
400,ex-jewish-princess,"But the reality of the situation is race and ethnicity are social categories. Its merely melanin and phenotype expressions. All what we consider within a race is social. Theres no behavioural or intrinsic biological expression by belonging to a race/ethnicity.

There is with sex and gender.

On top of that: the LGBT community havent made it fashionable and a fetish to pretend to be other races thats why we dont see it. Also, the community has benefited highly from white privilege. If majority of the trans people were black it would still be illegal today. Thus we dont see a massive fetish to be a different race"
401,archpope,"They shouldn't go into the women's room because they're not women. Believing they are doesn't make it so. Believing God told me to kill people doesn't make murder legal for me, so why should be laws be based on any other delusion."

403,Thatlikesomething,"Murder and taking a piss are way way way different issues. I'm not sure I'd even consider murder a human liberty. Now my opinion might not be popular but if you cut your dick off. Look like a lady. I don't think it's sensible for you to continue going in the men's room to empty the water main. At that point you're just being cynical. Who is really being protected in this circumstance? Is it still a matter of protection? Sure I'm still going to think of Jessica Yaniv as a predator I prefer be named Jonathon no matter what he does with his dick. 

But if people *see* you as a woman despite what your birth certificate says society shouldn't be standing outside of the women's room demanding every woman ""prove it"" before she gets in there just to catch a few trans people that ""pass"" and direct them to the men's room."

406,hyenanight,"A man cutting his dick off doesn't all of a sudden make him harmless to women and children. This is some bullshit that' s been said with too much frequency lately.  He still has the musculature and structure of a man, still has the entitled violent conditioning as a man, and still is not a woman, so he is still pushing himself into places he does not belong. Also, he has a mental illness that is so extreme, that he justified cutting his dick off and pretending he's a woman. That is the definition of a deranged person. 

This argument that dickless men are harmless and therefore should use  women's spaces is putting men above women, yet again. It's not our place to worry, coddle or keep safe men. This is a mental problem between themselves and a competent psychiatric professional, and between them and other men. Fuck this dressed up libfem shit about us having to look out for anyone else's safety but our own.

There is no such thing as ""transmisogyny"" (something is either misogynistic or it isn't), but if there were such a thing, by using this word you're in fact acknowledging that trans men are in fact women. Your own innate understanding of biology has betrayed your wokeness."
410,ApocalypseRedoux,"I think someone who dedicates the bulk of their free time to disparaging the (harmless) lives and identities as others is sad af - yes.

412,Thatlikesomething,"Also I've used the women's room plenty of times in my life. I don't look like a woman. I've never pretended nor fantasized. I think the whole restroom thing is so blown out of proportion. But this is me ""putting myself above women"" blah blah blah. Sometimes I just really have to go and this is a resort I've had to take in a panic. And I always make sure I hurry and have never been seen. Once.

Do I believe a man who cuts his dick off is magically a woman? No. As I clarified to the other poster. However you and I might imagine that makes his faculties look - it is a *compromise* we can agree he's made to switch from society seeing him as a Male. 

I'm not in the mindset of saying oh let's protect all men that want to be women fuck real women. No. This is NOT MY BELIEF SYSTEM. 

I'm saying if he really looks like a lady I'm not sure he's making wise life decisions to use the men's room just because he used to have a penis. At that point he shouldn't even have to talk about it. If he genuinely can walk by you and me in the grocery store and without two glances be able to know without a shadow of a doubt he 

>has the entitled violent conditioning as a man

Then why are we even concerned? Let him buy his panties and stop for a piss in the women's room and go home like everybody else. 

If he uses the women's room to attack somebody totally different. Call the police. But I'm not checking birth certificates to call out every possibly masculine looking face before they enter a restroom. Because even real women are ugly."
413,Thatlikesomething,"That's what I'm saying bro. And that's the real issue.

Trans rights are not actually about rights for trans people. It's about people who refuse to transition but want to occupy and claim spaces of others."

If you're in the UK MIND seems one of the better charities.

Also Asperger's is not 'a lie by the Nazis' FFS my father has a diagnosis so I know how real it is. Autism is a complex spectrum of symptoms and no two aspies will be the same.

Be strong in your own mind. You know you're not dysphoric. The human psyche is extremely complex and there could be 100s of reasons why you have a complex relationship with your body, especially your genitals. That's for you and a therapist you choose and trust to work through. Best of luck."

423,alexis21893,"From my experience with ocd what you describe does sound like the intrusive thoughts that come with it. I don't personally have Asperger's but my mother does and according to my mom she gets intrusive thoughts like this too so it might also be part of your Asperger's and simply a comorbid bunch of symptoms.

I have found though that sometimes it doesn't matter why you have a symptom as you can treat them in the same way regardless of reason (not always the case but often enough) so you might find the book called ""The OCD Workbook"" helpful. Not all the exercises will be applicable regardless of if you have OCD but it's not a bad book tbh. If you can't afford a psychiatrist or psychologist this might be a good way to learn coping mechanisms :)"
424,Lucretia123,"I believe that there are a lot of people,  paid by our governments and activists groups,  to groom vulnerable people online. 

They also report and harass people who's views they don't agree with. 

This was actually proven to be true.  The Australian government funded a communist group in Queensland to stalk and report people on social media. 

If you look at r/itsafetish, they often show instances of TRAs recruiting/grooming people.

He was literally trying to convince two teenage boys (one of whom came from a really broken fucking home and needed help and support) that they were 'trans girls, tee hee!'. I've wanted to post a story here about it as a heads-up that the recruiting shit is really happening and is very dangerous to young men ( of course women are more immediately threatened by trans-activism, but I think it sometimes gets overlooked that vulnerable males are also at a very high risk of being abused in these scenarios)

It's funny that they're literally using the tactics that conservatives have accused gay people of doing forever. Like...are they trying to make their community look as evil as possible?"
426,RobotAmerican,"Hi, aspergian here. Studies have shown that individual autistic brains can be more similar to each other (or even the opposite sex) than to neurotypicals of their own sex. This doesn't change what our actual sex is or what we identify as, however.

It seems to me that we get targeted by people who want to trans us because we come off as GNC. I have several autistic friends who are recently trans identified. I've had other LGBT individuals approach me and aggressively try to trans me, telling me that I **need to** trans or **already have** because I come off as masculine to them. I may not be ""girly"" enough in how I dress or in my interests (oh no, I'm a mechanic! the horror), but this has nothing to do with how feminine I am or how happy I am being a biological female.

Telling others what their sex is isn't healthy, and you need to guard yourself. No one else can identify you as dysphoric or trans. Good for you for recognizing it, and keep yourself safe. I hope that you have friends that help you feel supported."
427,NotTransphobic,"I think a lot of people have involuntary thoughts that they’d rather not, and I don’t necessarily think it’s unhealthy unless it’s causing a problem in your life. It can be hard to cope and deal with, but those people were way out of line to suggest transition as the way to handle any problems you may or may not have. 

You’re still very young, whether or not you think so. You’re going to grow a lot, sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. Most people could benefit from talking to a therapist but it’s stigmatized even today and hard for most people to access. 

You know yourself better than anyone else could, it’s nice to have others to bounce ideas off of, but don’t let these people who don’t have any idea of who you are trouble you when they try to push a “solution” you never wanted. 

Much strength to you, sincerely"
428,averlixx,I've had thoughts exactly like you describe and I identified as trans for a long time which just enabled those toxic thoughts. Then I was diagnosed with OCD and PTSD. Don't listen to them. I feel so much better now that I've embraced my sex instead of constantly wanting to hurt myself

Now with drag performers, I am always different. Don't ask me why. But I always used the pronoun associated with their performance.

Then you used that phrase ""... from some mixing a while back.."" which don't get me wrong,  is not awful or anything but it's at least as off colour as the original remark about an afro. 

Hence woke fail? I'm happy to see it's written loud and clear in the downvotes that tone policing of minutiae isn't welcome here!

All of this should be understood through the lense that exactly how PC or not a given word or phrase is will vary wildly to different people,  ""Afro"" perhaps has strong significance to you,  the far right ideas of miscegenation / race mixing have strong significance to me.

And as far as the tone policing -- that's ridiculous. I couldn't possibly care less about Political Correctness. I do care about instances where someone seems to be admitting to prejudice. OP felt the need to repeatedly point out that his friend had [insert racial characteristic here] when race is irrelevant to his story, and that's something I'm going to call people out on (OP now claims that he's using the term ""afro"" to refer to something other than an actual afro, and that his friend isn't black, but that was after I raised my question).

Sorry, maybe it's the editor in me, maybe it's the fact that my family is from the Caribbean and we see race differently than many other cultures do, but calling out someone on an apparent dog-whistle in a sub where language and word choice are critical subjects of discussion isn't, to my mind, unreasonable.

I am a Libertarian-Right conservative Christian. Fundamentally that means I believe that a smaller government is ideal and that capitalism, while it does have its flaws, is a better system than socialism as the economic foundation for a country. (I'm not trying to spark debate on these topics, but just making sure you know where I stand)

Let's discuss the purpose of GenderCriticalGuys and the network of subreddits (/r/itsafetish, /r/GenderCritical, /r/LGBDropTheT among others) that discuss radical feminism. Radical Feminism focuses on breaking down the patriarchal on which many parts of the world stand. Beyond that, Radical Feminism also decries the sexual freedom movement that ultimately gave men a free ticket to go around and get laid (this assumes that sex is a win loss for men and women respectively.) Along with this, it also decries the porn industry as exploitative and the sexual objectification of women in general. Radical feminism also supports abortion, which is represented by a largely religious divide.

Now, I'd like to address your post.

1. right-wing, reactionary bigots that hate freedom and support gender conformity

I grew up in a household where the roles were switched. My mother worked and my dad stayed at home. In fact, I've personally never believed that your sex should dictate what you are allowed and not allowed to do in life. Women shouldn't be relegated to being stay at home moms if that isn't what they want to do.

2. Conservatism is antithetical to the views of this sub and the main sub. Conservatives on this sub do us no favors and actually provide fuel for the TRAs to use against us.

I can understand why having Conservatives on this sub could damage your reputation. These are both predominantly leftist groups and I don't want to add fuel to the already raging fire between the TRAs and GC members.

1. We do not hate trans people and we certainly do not wish them harm.

I believe that trans people should be helped, not harmed or attacked. Many of them have legitimate mental illnesses and really do need someone to help.

2. Trans people should not be discriminated against in employment, housing, or in any other way.

No one should be discriminated against. Just because someone is trans shouldn't mean they should be discriminated against.

3. Trans people deserve rights. However, we believe that these rights should not come at the expense of women’s rights.

This is exactly how I feel. You can go get gender reassignment surgery if you want, you can go on HRT, I don't think those things should be illegal. However I draw the line at allowing people who are playing pretend with their gender into spaces where they are not supposed to be. If you're a girl who is on the swim team, you do not want to go back to your locker room to change only to see a 'feminine penis' dangling around as you're undressing.

4. If you hate trans people, GET THE FUCK OUT.

I don't hate trans people. They need help, not hate.

5. If you hate feminists, GET THE FUCK OUT.

I don't hate feminists. They've got some really good perspectives on things and bring a lot of points that I agree with.

6. Go create your own subreddit where you are free to be a right-wing shit for brains.

This is ultimately what bothers me. There's this catch-all statement that implies all right-wingers are shit for brains mongoloids who are legitimately brain damaged. This simply isn't the case. 

There are a lot of people on the right who are equally horrified about how modern society turns women into sexual objects, how porn is destroying the relational aspects of sex, and how trans people are invading women's private spaces at their expense.

I hope I've given a good example of my viewpoints. I'm happy to discuss any of them. I want to be an ally, I want to see the world reject the dehumanization of women and the devaluation of sex, I want women and men to be seen as equals and for society to look past gender.

Thanks for your time. I apologize for the length.

That may be something which you see in your specific area or country, but that isn't the norm everywhere. It is perfectly possible to be a political or economic conservative and not hate the people, but question the current gender narrative of it being natural and normal, and instead want to help these people by them getting the appropriate treatment.

I would also suggest that you tone down a smidge. One thing that came with age was the wisdom of knowing that the world isn't black and white. Not everything right wing makes you a ""shit for brains"", no more than left wing makes someone a ""snowflake"" and the other slurs that are thrown around.

All of those that call themselves conservatives are not the same. A fair number can think inside and outside of the ""labelled boxes"".

I've met a good number that believe in a strong national defense, stronger border security, and in the equality of both sexes at work, home, and in the world.

People can hold their religious believes and still be sensible to the world outside their worship buildings. Many will say that they are Pro-Life in their beliefs, but also realize, as a man, they have no say because that is strictly a women's issue.

There should be forward movement in society and education, but only as long as our past and history are not forgotten. This country hasn't always done the right thing, but it learned from it's mistakes.

In the past it was the political party that was left-of-center that wanted to keep slavery and that created the KKK, while it was the political part that was right-of-center that abolished keeping people as property and outlawing white supremacists groups like those in white sheets and hoods.

The direction political party push/pull/leans to does change over time. Almost always by the people inside those parties. The belief that women shouldn't work, shouldn't get a higher education, or be allowed to vote was the  Democratic party, not the Republicans.

History is being forgotten. And that's bad. Worse yet, people are trying to change our history...and that's more then bad.

Women gained the right to vote, to go to college, and to work not from the progressive side of the political isle but from the conservative side.

When something is the right thing to do, or to change, for the rights of women, history tells us those with a conservative lean have often lead for the correct changes.

Unless people with a different view points are available to have a discussion with, every one here then is just preaching to the choir. Nothing changes because there's no one to convert.

Now anyone, from either side, that's starts spouting hate or crazy, (pick a direction) radical ideas should be shown to the door but an out right ban....because you ""think"" someone is going to believe things differently then you do...kinda sounds like hate to me. Which would make what you've been saying ""hate speech"".  See how quickly things can get turned?

I've often found that if these people with their radical ideas are just ignored, they pretty much go away because they are looking for an argument.

658,Throwmeawayoffcliff,">the words ""radical"" and ""feminist"" can mean a lot of things

Radical feminism is a specific ideology. One that has diversity of thought within it, to be sure, but nonetheless it is not just a vague term using the broad political meaning of the term radical. The term ""radical feminist"" is often used by noon feminists or non radical feminists to just generally mean extreme and/or ""crazy"" feminism, when the ideology is rather more particular than that

>So what do you mean when you say ""inherently left wing"", exactly?

Well, radical feminism arose out of the second wave feminist movement, at a time when feminism in general tended to be the realm of the political left, or at least with the ideas entering the mainstream originating from the left. And radical feminism in particular arose out of the ""new left"" of the 60s and 70s, being strongly associated with the leftwing politics at the edge of the mainstream as well as things like socialism and marxism outside the mainstream, though at the same time being rather critical of both establishment centrist/liberal politics and less mainstream politics of the further left, not criticizing them because they went too far, but rather criticizing those movements as not going far enough in regards to matters like women's equality and liberation. There had been a few attempts the cooperate with conservatives on individual issues (which tended to fail), but even then, the radical feminists making those attempts were generally motivated by left-wing ideals and opposed to the broader right-wing platform, and for the most part, radical feminists would simply work (or try to work) with the left. And that characteristic just never really changed, radical feminism has remained that sort of thing, generally strongly associated with the political left either at the edge of the mainstream or even outside of it, having a lot of overlap with marxian or otherwise socialist feminism

>when you say radical left wing... just marxist leninist states and pedos

Uh there's a lot more to the radical left than the one particular type of communism and some pro pedo pomo philosophers...

>You're probably refering to women's rights and a general social-democracy-type framework for a wellfare state; In many european countries, that is the expectation on every side of the political discourse. In my country it certainly is.

I've already alluded to this, but radical feminism tends to have a vision of rather more ambitious and major change than just ""euro socdems"". Sure, the mainstream American political discourse may see the Euro socdems as being ""the left"", but radical feminism is rather outside of the American mainstream discourse and spectrum

>So forgive me if I don't appreciate a lecture on morality from someone born in a country that didn't ban slavery untill the 1800s, a nation that is still exploiting its incarcerated populace for unpaid labour, a nation that still haven't given back the native population the land that you stole from them.

Well that's really rich coming from the continent that gave the world the fucking holocaust

Is America really fucked up even today? Yeah absolutely, there's no denying it. But geez, there's some tendency for some on both sides of the water to act like Europe is some sort of enlightened land of perfection in contrast to American barbarism, but frankly Europe even today has some pretty big issues itself, with for example the rise of the nationalists and far right, along with continuing issues with poverty and so on (for all that Europe gets labelled left-wing, I'd venture to say that in our modern world with all the capability that humanity has, that a system that at the very least ensure some sort of ""universal basic outcome"" (or UBO) that ensures no poverty exists is the bare minimum of decency that could be deserving even just of the title of ""moderate"" rather than anything remotely radical, and in that regard, Europe fails too, even though it does come a little closer than the US)

So that sort of shooting the messenger just because they came from America is frankly rather absurd

>History stuff

It seems a little unrealistic to think that those areas actually had full societal equality, even when they did grant various legal protections to women and even legally allow them to do various things only men in other societies were able to do. Sexism and patriarchy aren't only matters of de jure law, but also of societal norms and de facto aspects and such"
659,TheFeministFox,"Just a few things from a fellow European:

1) The words ""radical feminist"" can not mean a lot of things. Radix means ""root"", the word radical evolved over time to what the dictionary so wonderful describes as ""affecting the fundamental nature of something"". Feminism is a movement that seeks to eliminate sex-based patriarchal oppression. Therefore radical feminism stands for a movement that wants to overhaul the system by ""affecting it's fundamental nature"". Which lies within misogyny, false beliefs about brain sex, etc. etc.

2) Sex-based oppressions started around the time written language had become a bit more evolved, which was ca. 1000-500 b.C. - so no, it is not ""Christendom"" that erased equality.

3) In Norse (aka Viking) society, women were better off than in other parts of the world at the time. But women still were, by law, under the authority by their husband or father. Each sex still had set rules based on gender/sex stereotypes. Women had to do domestic labor and be the good houswife. Men did raiding, trading and settlement journeys. So no.

4) This is the first time I hear of Scandinavia having liberal stances on left AND right. It is actually described as ""growing to becoming a hotspot for neo-nazis and right-wing extremists"". I still distincticely remember reading about it several times since Breivik in 2011. But since I do not live in a Scandinavian country I suppose you'd know more than me, for me it's just what I heard and read.

5) No, left-wing and right-wing do not vary in their core values internationally. What varies might be the degree of how far leaning left-wing and right-wing is. That's why it's a political spectrum. But the right is ""the right"" as described here. Just because some right-wing parties know a health care system is good doesn't make them any less conservative. If anything, it seems that your definition of right wing is very america-centric, describing only the most conservative and extreme examples as right-wing, especially in a context that does not even have anything to do with the initial approach (sexism)."

668,throwaway275445,I think recent events should have shown you progress isn't always for the better. We've no proof that whatever comes after capitalism will be any better for women and we need to be practical about the problems not near religious over ideology.
669,Samura1_I3,"Progression towards what though? A society that makes sex purely transnational? A world where women are reduced to sexual objects an nothing more?

Progress isn't always positive. Third wave feminism is progress from second wave feminism, but in a direction that is becoming more and more degenerate. That degeneracy is what RadFems are decrying, and many conservatives are too.

Conservatism to me is about upholding the moral framework of our country (and repairing it where needed such as abolishing slavery). I, along with many other conservatives, are worried that movements like 3rd wave feminism and post-modern queer theory are departures from our fundamental American values.

Obviously we should be moving forward, but not just for moving forward's sake. From the view of the Far Left specifically, conservatives are seen as regressive and bigoted because the Far Left has moved so far from what America used to be. Obviously good changes have been made, like LGBT rights, Women's rights, the Civil Rights Act, etc. However some things take those things too far such as encouraging sexual objectification or giving TiMs access to women's private spaces.

I suppose another example could be how different android and iPhones are. (bear with me)

Android phones, representing the left, come out with some radically innovative and amazing designs. Folding screens, tiny bezels, fingerprint readers, crazy unique designs, and impressive software features.

iPhones are designed more conservatively. They didn't get OLED screens for several years after android. They stuck with massive bezels until 2017, and the general design of iPhones is the basically same since they came out. The reason for this is Apple is adverse to jumping into a trend too quick. They may be slow to the market with their OLED panels, but they come once the technology matures enough to meet their standards. But when they do, it works and it does it well. Many android phones are plagued with flaws because of the constant contest to make the weirdest or craziest design by ushering in technologies that just aren't ready.

Liberalism pushed for sexual freedom during the Sexual Revolution of the 1960s to the 1980s. Out of that came many things, some good and some bad. For instance, the acknowledgement that homosexuality is valid and gay people exist and shouldn't be discriminated against. But it also brought with it the normalization of pornography, prostitution, and, because of the increase promiscuity, abortion. These are all negative (and on the abortion note, I think we all agree that fewer abortions would be better) and were ushered in by a movement that was driven by progress for progress's sake. That's what I'm getting at. If we took a more metered approach instead of the sexual revolution we likely wouldn't see the pornography epidemic, objectification of women, and the troubling numbers of abortions that we see today. That's why I believe that progress needs to be metered by conserving the foundational values of our country.

Sorry again for the length. I'm really appreciating this discussion :)"

She needs him and he needs her.  The problem is that patriarchy is getting in the way.  The only way that she and he will get along in a mutually beneficial manner is if the two are on equal terms.  However, with patriarchy in existence, we men MUST make the first move toward abolition.  This, in turn, will hopefully prove our sincerity to HER satisfaction.

To be clear - I support safe spaces for women only, men only, and trans only.  I support the radfem goal of gender aboltion, but am on the fence about all the rest (much of which, let's be frank, goes over my head).  

For those of you wondering about my politics, I'm a Social Democrat.  By this, I mean that the needs of the people outweigh the greed of the few.  I believe that the only acceptable form of capitalism is the worker-owned cooperative.  Religion is nice, but it cannot take the power of the State.  The American philosopher Thomas Jefferson established Separation of Church and State for a reason - history shows that when church and state conflate, both are corrupted.  (Come to think of it, is this the reason why Jesus told us that his Church is not of this world?)

>Conservatism to me is about upholding the moral framework of our country (and repairing it where needed such as abolishing slavery). I, along with many other conservatives, are worried that movements like 3rd wave feminism and post-modern queer theory are departures from our fundamental American values. 

If you replaced the term ""Conservatism"" with ""Progressivism"" I would 100% agree. Progressivism is about upholding our moral framework of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, Samuel Adams, were all radical revolutionaries. Even more conservative figures like John Adams, John Jay, and Washington were pretty fucking radical. The founding ideals of this country are left-wing in nature. 

Let's use your phone example. (I am an andriod user myself) In my opinion, the Samsung Galaxy S10 is a far superior phone to any other andriod or any iphone. The folding screen, removing the headphone jack, making them heavy and unwieldy, as some phones have become are like TRAs and the regressive left. That isn't progress, we've already been there and it sucks. You're only supporting the antiquated ideas of the past. Iphones are like conservatives, they aren't really all the good. They only improve when they absolutely have to compete, but still, take away the features you want like a headphone jack etc. Progressives are like the Samsung Galaxy series. Always pushing the boundaries, making great phones, and giving users choice and options.   


TBF, I don't really like that analogy, so sorry if it sucks.   


You should know that liberalism =/= Leftist politics. Liberalism is TRA shit. Liberalism is Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. So don't get progressivism and left-wing politics confused with liberalism. They are not the same. Liberalism is the enemy of progress. People that support the porn epidemic, sex-work, and the objectification of women as empowering are liberals. That is not progress that is regressive. That is not the world I want."

This is why I want to keep conservatives here on this subreddit. There's of of people like me and a lot of people like you. Let's use eachother's ideas and move forward together.

Back to phones (your analogy was a good one, I'm catching your drift). You can't deny that iPhones are the standard by which we compare all other phones. Samsung phones wouldn't be where they are today without iPhones being a baseline for comparison **BUT** iPhones wouldn't be what they are without pressure from Samsung phones to innovate. The two work together to make the smartphone market we see today. We've got really good samsung phones and really good iPhones.

It's a balance, it always has been. If we were only conservatives, we would be a shit society where everyone lived in the dark ages lmao. If we were a purely liberal society, we'd all be forced to join in gay orgies to prove we aren't bigoted. Thankfully, we live in a society where private space companies are landing rockets like science fiction and we can openly call the president a cunt without being shot.

The word progressive has been co-opted by the Left and is used to describe any 'woke' policy that pushes the boundaries of society. Again, it values progress for the sake of progress over actual good progress. With your definition of progressive, I'd call myself one too. The only difference is that you'd be on the gas and I'd be on the brakes. Together we'll get somewhere. By ourselves, we'll either drive off a cliff or get rear ended."

Personally I am worried about places becoming echo chambers and letting bad ideas spread because people are afraid that criticizing them outs them. Imo, that's the core issue of politics. People are offended if you have a different option. You have to walk on eggshells if you want to engage with people and actually have a good conversation. It's hard, I tried it and fucked up badly because I didn't understand how personal these things are.

Labour may be more ""pro-trans"" than the conservatives, it's also more supportive of women. These things are not necessarily at odds. The Tories are not pro GC or pro radfem, they are against anyone who isn't a wealthy (usually white) man. 

Even if some trans inclusive policies have the potential to hurt women, labour still supports the protected status of female people, and in practice labour policies hurt women a lot less than those of the conservatives.

When it comes to it, the inner workings of a party is not what affects regular people, policies are. And I would rather support a party that doesn't completely throw working women under the bus in order to increase the power of wealthy men."

>This happened with my little sister too. She’s in middle school and has been out as a lesbian since she was 13. She’s a baby butch, she wears typically masculine clothing, has an undercut, and doesn’t wear makeup or jewelry (she has a very feminine face and body so it’s pretty hard to mistake her as a boy though). **Her transgender friends at school pressured her to admit she was a transboy or non-binary and also pressured her to change her preferences** (surprise surprise, these friends were TIM’s). They even went so far as to ignore her preferred pronouns (she/her) and call her he/him or they/them, AND THEN THEY CHANGED HER NAME FOR HER. They wouldn’t call her by her own name! They called her Kai, even when she begged them not to and to call her Keziah, her birth name, a name she’s always loved and is proud of. **The bullying, combined with the school’s complete disinterest in helping her, contributed to her dropping out. OF MIDDLE SCHOOL. When she tried to enroll in highschool this year, the same thing happened.** Same TIM’s pushing an identity she didnt want on her. **She left after less than a month.**  
>  
>She takes classes at our local university for her high school credits now, and she’s brilliant, but she never will get the high school experience. She will never be able to go to prom with her girlfriend or graduate beside her peers. She has been robbed of the friendships, the hardships, and the lessons and is forced to grow up early, all because of genderist bullshit telling lesbians they shouldn’t be lesbians. So yeah, I believe that this shit is happening, because its happened to my family, and it probably would have happened to me too if I had been born six years later. My sister is already a casualty of trans-centered schooling. She won’t be the last. And that kills me."

The difference between 80 and 71 though - that’s an entire future. An IQ of 80 can work fast food and even move up to a shift lead or assistant management. They probably won’t ever get a degree but they might get a cert in HVAC or mechanics if they’re good with their hands. 70 however is lacking serious skills and finding any possible living wage will be almost impossible outside of a program designed to give jobs to mentally handicapped people. 70 is unlikely to successfully live alone outside of a group-Home environment.

They turned their burger-flipping independent boy into an unemployable girl who will have to live at home forever. As a sped teacher, this bothers me so much more.

767,,[deleted]
768,frankzanzibar,That's not how any of this works!
769,brown3jh,"That’s a far more complicated question. With doctors who are straightforward, it’s still used because you’re just quoting the official diagnosis. When talking about the diagnosis with others it ranges from retarded to whatever phrase is in that day. When just having a run of the mill discussion everyone uses their own preferred term but, if you said retarded you’d be castigated. 

Here’s my hot take with as much pith as I can lend. 

I’m autistic. I believe that retardation is fine to use as a diagnosis and should be fine to use in parlance when discussing such things. I don’t think you should just randomly call retarded people retarded but, it doesn’t actually bother me. The truth is, some people are adequately defined by that word—not to say they couldn’t be more aptly defined by better words but, they’re slow—they’re actually retarded. What I’ve seen happen is that in lieu of retarded we just use autistic. Not even just in medicine, check out Reddit. Phrases like “he’s going autistic” or “check your autism” or even the colloquial “reeeeeeeee”. It’s the same thing and we’re going to keep having this meaningless battle as infinitem. 

I’m in the medical field. I went to college to be a scientist. To me, this is a battle for linguists to have in the halls of the university—a cosmetic battle at best. I don’t have time for cosmetics because I’m busy with real shit. Word really are just words. How we use them is far more important than what words were used and I’m just trying to do my job."
770,VampiricBlackMetal,"Kinda like from going to ""colored people"" to ""people of color"" I guess.

The dictionary would like to have a word with you.

retard
verb
/rɪˈtɑːd/
1.
delay or hold back in terms of progress or development.
""our progress was retarded by unforeseen difficulties""
synonyms:	delay, slow down, slow up, hold back, set back, keep back, hold up, postpone, put back, detain, decelerate, put a brake on; More"
771,Kaiserjager,That's incorrect. Retardation is a word that has applications. You just don't have to use it to refer to people or mental disabilities. It means to slow the development or progress of something. It is a more concise term in certain contexts and is used in those situations.
772,DistantGlimmer,"Seems like we are going backwards from ""biological sex is a thing but gender is a construct and doesn't even really matter"" to ""Performatively over-emphasize whatever gender you feel like being and reinforce stereotypical gender roles while pretending biological sex doesn't exist .""  There should be nothing wrong with a gay (or straight) guy who just acts in a way that is judged more feminine but now I guess he will be pressured to ""transition"" to match his  perceived gender. It's sad, feels anti-feminist and is  not something I can buy into."

787,Kai_Decadence,"This is so freaking true and I say this as a feminine gay guy who has noticed this for a good while now. I know the main cause for this is because llving as a feminine man and dating as a feminine gay man be one of the hardest things a guy can do. People treat feminine men like we're creeps or weirdos and in gay dating, most gay men are attracted to masculine men and it doesn't help when some of these guys say things like ""I'm attracted to real men"" or ""If I wanted to date someone feminine, I would date a woman"" and other variations of this. It can really wreak havoc on a feminine guy's mind and make them feel like the only way they can live a good, non-judgmental life is to call themselves ""Trans"" (""I'm actually a woman trapped in a man's body"" or other stuff like that). 

I've not had the best time living my life as the way I am but I know deep down that in order to see change, we must be the change and so I'm not gonna run away and call myself ""Trans"" to justify my lack of conforming to masculinity that is imposed on males. Butch/Masculine girls have stood their ground for decades and refused to change themselves and I think this did pay off somewhat as butch women have not disappeared all that much and I think this is why you're more likely to find butch women who are okay with and accept that they're women even if they don't fit society's expectations and I think we genuine feminine guys need to be doing the same. 

So this is why I reject the trans label and I speak out against it because it solves nothing. We need to show that we GNC men and women are people who deserve to be treated with at least common decency. You don't need to date us if you don't want to, personal preferences are a thing and they are fine but to extend that to treat a person like they're nothing just because they don't conform to gender roles is disgusting."

The lesson in the video is that it's fine for a man to be interested in raising kids or having a doll.

Even if we usually see the most flagrant examples posted online  , it seems like any hint of a young person expressing  masc or fem interests is enough to convince people they're transgender.

I've heard a lot about lesbians getting rape threats for refusing to have sex with penis-havers who identify as women, but this is a new one."
810,Kai_Decadence,"Now that is true. Men seem to be the ones who have the biggest problem with feminine men. [This](https://i.imgur.com/mVHacJs.jpg) is how I look and I've gotten treated quite dismissively from some men who come into my job where I'm supposed to greet people and sign them in. And outside of work, I do have a feminine look that does get me stares and my family doesn't approve of it as well (they're religious and believe strictly in the gender roles) . So believe me, I get what you mean because it's not easy living my life the way I do when people can so obviously find discomfort from it. 

But it's not worth fucking up your body with hormones and surgery or pissing off women who need their own spaces and shouldn't be forced to date people they don't want to date (in regards to lesbians) so no I will continue to be true to myself. I want people to see that YES, you can be a guy and a feminine one at that and it not be a big deal. Pete Burns was a big inspiration in my mindset because he lived his life till his death being true to himself and giving the middle finger to those who judged him simply because he preferred to be feminine (ignoring the botched lip surgery) and I think we need more people like that. 

I mean don't you find it very ironic that ""transwomen"" outnumber ""Transmen"" by a good amount yet Butch/Masculine women outnumber outward feminine men? I think the reasoning for this is quite clear and I think we feminine men need to follow what the butch/masculine women have been doing for decades with no apologies."
811,Thatlikesomething,"I'm a straight male and I still am moved by this misconception of ""self-acceptance"" or being ""your true self."" 

One reason it bothers me is because I'm black. And minorities have always been celebrated in the media when they ""pass"" like look at the movie Coming To America with Eddie Murphy. The movie where an African Prince leaves Africa goes to New York and falls in love with a black woman who is light-skinned. In a way, the entire movie can be summed up as dark-skinned black women just suck. If any of you would like to see how this sentiment is expressed in the movie pay attention the *younger sister* of the light-skinned woman. She is a dark-skinned woman. Very pretty. But! They depict her with poor attitude and don't even go so far as give her make-up. She also is a minor character in the film."
812,fridakahlosmonkey,"exactly. hundreds of years ago men wore makeup, had long flowing hair, showed off their legs in stockings, and wore high heels- while women did not wear make up (unless they were prostitutes), hid their legs under floor or ankle length skirts, and had to wear their long hair up and or covered. Men were the peacocks. That changed during the French Revolution with men becoming less ""fancy"" and becoming even plainer during Victorian times. Dandies had a resurgence in the mid to late 19th century and men once again got a little fancy. the 1920s saw an explosion of makeup for both men and women, as well as short hair for women. And finally we had the 70s where women could wear utilitarian clothes that had been reserved for men, cut their hair, and could stop wearing makeup (which they'd only been allowed to wear on a large scale since the 1920s), while men grew their hair, colored it, wore intricate embroidered clothing, chunky high heels, and indeed sometimes makeup. 

None of this stuff is inherently male of female. I would absolutely caution anyone against taking hormones or getting surgery if aesthetics plays a role in them feeling like they're the opposite sex. These are just clothing fads and they mean nothing."
813,Peach_Muffin,Yep there was an article a while ago by a man who used Grindr to have sex with TIMs and was frustrated by all the men hitting on him!
814,Nibbana0,"I feel horrible because admittedly some gay men performing femininity would irritate me, no anger or anything, just dang guys we don't behave that way and if we do we're obnoxious divas, hope you understand that without feeling slighted. Now I wish I could hug you all and thank you for being you without hurting females in the slightest ! I'm sorry. Hope all the best for you."
815,Kai_Decadence,"But see that's the problem. I think some people automatically assume that every feminine looking guys who happen to be gay are gonna act like divas or super flamboyant but that isn't true for all of us. Speaking for myself, I do not act like a diva. I'm not even obsessed with drag culture.  I've even had in the past where some guys have said they were surprised that I didn't act like that despite my appearance. 

I think the question you should ask yourself is why you feel negatively towards feminine guys and keep in mind, there is a difference between feminine and flamboyant. Flamboyant is like a caricature whereas feminine is just opposite of masculine and to jump forward, the ""flamboyant"" in my opinion are obnoxious dude bros. Are you bothered by those kinds of guys?"

817,Nibbana0,"Oh it was definitely the flamboyant not feminine, that was a poor choice of comparison,stand corrected!"
818,Kai_Decadence,"It's okay, it tends to happen. The way I go about it is if the guy acts like a drag queen or like he s on RuPaul's Drag race, he s being flamboyant and it's really just an exaggerated personality that is not really natural."
819,Nibbana0,"The drag queen stuff can be too much but it's entertainment, and some drag queens are quite different outside of costume. I don't know how to explain I guess. Just drama in general, attention seeking, irritates me from anyone so flamboyance from a gay man is going to as well."
820,Kai_Decadence,No I get that drag is entertainment but why I'm talking about are people who act like that outside of drag (or those who are so obsessed with drag culture but aren't drag queens themselves). I'm sure you know what I mean lol
821,AdamRGdotcom,It's absurd this even got to court. Anyone with an ounce of common sense normally wouldn't give something like this the time of day.

It's great to have as a resource to refer people to as well when they express the sincere doubt and confusion with the current gender narrative that I think many people feel but are afraid to express.

I was hanging out with my friend the other day and lacking any better topic of conversation I brought up the GC and trans stuff I've been looking at for the past couple weeks. Within like 60 seconds she was talking non-stop about her own issues and thoughts like it was her first chance to speak them aloud lol. We went on for like 20 mins.

It's just nice to hear some sense. There's some danger of it being just an echo chamber circlejerk but I feel like I've seen more nuanced opinions than just repeating the same nonsense. Though ofc there will always be some circlejerking. It is Reddit after all."
836,WeirdCurrent3,I wish we could do a bit more about people who think that just being anti-trans means they're welcome here. It's a problem on the main sub too but it feels worse here.

In fact, mainstream liberal feminism - feminism inclusive of transwomen - is capable of serious idiocy.

839,weretomato,"Well, those guys you deal with online are clearly either low-key misogynists or really fed up with political feminism, or both.

You'll find a mixed bag, here.

The philosophical root of this sub is broadly radfem, and they'll be the first to say that they (the radfems) ""own"" gender criticalness. I've only had a brief gander at the comments below, and it seems to be basically that. 

Most people here are probably radfem allies and the somewhat lurking radfems from over at GC HQ. Then there are the libfem lurkers and the TRA lurkers. Then there are people like me, who are broadly egalitarian but don't limit themselves to a feminist philosophy.

This is a decent sub if you want to observe the milieu of the radfem camp. It's a decent place for a conversation, although it has to be the ""right"" kind of conversation--see the sidebar rules (e.g., rules 3 and 4 are basically blanket censorship rules and 5 is silly and IDK how it's even used here, but eh, it's neither here nor there).

If you're here just because you've been peak-transed or are especially focused on gender critical theory or TRA stuff, you may find yourself surprised. If so, I'd say stick around and you'll probably find interesting conversations and unique points of view.  You may not agree with all of them (I've certainly got ""in trouble"" here before) but it never hurts to be open-minded and listen to other people."

I hope someday soon to look back and not even recall the last time I was even tempted by by porn, but that’s not today. This sub and the main GC sub did help me “start quitting” by seeing the truth about porn tho among other things, which is was the spirit of my “Diddo.”

Porn accelerates the conflation of rape, affection, and ownership in the direction dehumanizing women. <— I hope that sentence makes sense, I’m sure there’s a better way to say that, but I’ve already rewrote this damn reply like 5 times.

855,archpope,"I've read them (the first link I read twice, actually), but I'm getting hung up on the use of the word ""gender"" as a value system. That's different from both the dictionary and how TRAs use it. It sounds similar to what they called ""gender roles"" in my psych classes in college, but not exactly the same. I think this confusion over the use of the word is why you're getting a lot of anti-trans but not RadFem people here, since the TRA definition of ""gender"" seems to be the dominant one right now. Based on your definition of the word ""gender,"" though, I can see why you'd be critical of it."

It's a complicated subject, one that doesn't benefit from reductive thinking. Some people seem to have issues with porn, others don't. Just like some people have issues with gambling or alcohol and others don't. So, not to harp on anything that isn't my business, but it still seems like you're saying you don't masturbate. To each his own, but I have to tell you it's not healthy to not masturbate, for many reasons."
859,-cub-,"right. so GC actually stands for Critical of Gender as a system of oppression, and 'system of oppression' is of course laid out by that link. mere different roles are not in theory oppressive, but assigning greater value to one set of roles over another is. and to speak of this is to be gencrit. radfems use this as the starting point, and when a man claims to ""feel like a woman"" it makes no sense.  if you follow up with the gender page linked at the masthead of the second link, that idea is fleshed out. i would also recommend clicking on ""how did we get here?"" to explain what happened on the left."

It seems like women should be capable of understanding the disadvantage they have in a fight, and refraining from initiating a fight with a man. 

That being said, one should only use as much force as they have to against any attacker. It’s not self defense if you go way beyond defending yourself. But that applies to male or female opponents."

866,Lt_Shade_Gautier,"So, before I comment just want to state my thoughts on this since I am trans, I don’t think it’s something that would catch on or even be regarded but if you care to read then okay

Okay so I do not think a trans man or trans woman should be in men’s or women’s professional competitive sports

Big shocker right

My reason for saying, just common sense of biology, and that for an example, if a trans guy went to compete against biological guys then he could get hurt, same with cis women vs a trans women, the cis women is more likely to get hurt more

But I had the idea that I believe will never catch on because no one gives a crap and would rather just reee instead of figure out solutions to make both sides happy, that a fully transitioned trans person should only compete against another trans person, ie trans guy vs trans guy, vice versa

Look I say this on a logical perspective not of my own bias, just what makes sense, and I keep feeling like people would say “oh they’re just trying to make everything about them” when honestly I’m just tired of bullshit, a trans person wants to compete, if they win then the world blows up, if they loose same thing

Honestly I’m just the kind of person that tries to work out solutions for everyone on both sides to at least be content, I’m definitely open for discussion on this for what you, the readers thoughts are

You do see clips of women acting up to men but those are literally a few instances that get posted online and aren’t at all comparable to all the women that get assaulted by men. I’m not denying that women abuse men too, but ask yourself which one is more common? 

As I already said, if you’re genuinely under threat by a woman, you should absolutely use force to defend yourself. I just don’t want innocent women to get assaulted as backlash to feminism. Now if a woman starts a fight and actually starts attacking you, then it’s on her. But don’t permanently disfigure a woman’s face just because she shouted in your face. I think common sense can be easily applied in these situations."

Claiming this is modern is silly.

I don't know that enough people swim the English Channel to say anything reliably about performance of men vs. women. https://www.channelswimmingassociation.com maintains records.

I see addiction, anxiety, and depression mentioned. I can relate to the first myself. If I am honest with myself about it I want to cry. I feel weak, but there is some strength in acknowledging our faults. I’ve drank for more than half my life and I try to keep it in check. I will admit I once was deep into pornography but it never affected my personal relationships, but I also now think it was deeply rooted in boredom and hedonism. It felt good, I had nothing better to do, if you masturbate til you’re chafed and sore that’s a problem. 
An addictive personality can go way too far with anything.  

You don’t want to transition or trespass into women’s spaces, but the need to objectify women isn’t healthy whatsoever. What made you feel this way? Society? Pornography?  

I’m dead tired so I can’t offer as much and I would like now. but I hope you understand where I’m coming from. Good luck in having this discussion."

That's why strap-ons exist. I don't see anyone telling all those women pegging their partners they must be secretly trans, they would be laughed off the internet.

898,mushroomyakuza,"Yes I can see that. The problem for women is they will be told they ""don't understand"", which is unfalsifiable. When an AGP man like myself says the same thing, I'm told I'm an ""egg"" with ""internalised transphobia"". You literally cannot win. M2F TRAs scream louder than anyone, and I think this is because they carry with them some of the male entitlement they grew up with. I've never seen or heard of F2M TRAs being anywhere near as vocal, loud or aggressive in comparison. The M2Fs know they just need to keep screaming louder to force capitulation.

For me this is it. I do see women as subordinate sexually, and I think a large amount of society does. I don't think it's only a social construct though, I do genuinely think there is such a thing as a ""feminine essence"" and a ""masculine essence"" too. There are gender traits in nature, but society does perpetuate and exacerbate them. This is the problem. Men have such a hard time accepting the notion of being a submissive male that they literally convince themselves they are female and ""transition"" to fit that role. Put like that, it's the most incredibly misogynistic thing I've ever heard."

I don't understand how anyone like myself could consciously transition and have a shred of integrity or self respect left. No wonder suicide is high.

Yes, a lot of them hide it, then it escalates. This all happens because they're so unable to communicate. This is partly individual and partly societal. Society creates a pressure around this where its not permitted for a man to feel this way, then that drips down the individual where they obscure things as ""just fun"", then before you know it, you're a trans widow and your whole life has fallen apart, because your husband lacked the communication skills and bravery to be open and honest about it."

The differences are scope and permanence, mind you (a vegan can just stop, never has to bring it up), but trying to make me think a trans woman is attractive when I am most attracted to the ""natural"" look is as unrealistic as me giving up bacon because someone told me to.  If makeup turns me off, what right do you have to tell me that plastic flesh and reformed skin is beautiful?  I feel the same about fake titties in ANY human.  You just have your reasons, I have my tastes, and none of this affects whether I can get along with you as a human.  My genitals are not into it, that has NOTHING to do with my brain.

I’ve played multiple sports at a high level and I’m gonna tell you this, anyone that tries to make it seem like men belong in women’s sport hasn’t played a physical sport at ANY competitive level, bar primary school. Why tf are these people even contributing with their non existent knowledge and experience when it comes to sports when real female athletes are missing out of real opportunities. Idgaf how long someone’s  been on hrt for, start your own league or play in your assigned gender’s category. 

The sports where women can seriously get hurt are the ones I’m seriously concerned about. Look up one of the best ever female combat athletes, Lucia Rijker (she was undefeated in 35+ kickboxing fights and also undeafeated as a pro boxer) and she fought a guy who doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page and got brutally knocked out. She was fighting a guy her size, roughly. Now imagine sports where there’s no weight classes (this makes up most sports) such as Rugby, American football, etc. Women will start quitting sports if they not only have to compete against transwomen, but also have to get changed in same changing rooms. Where tf is the empathy for them?

I'm pointing out that a lot of Tim's, especially when they transition after their early 20's, always seem to make some kind statement about how much younger they look now and they think that HRT is like a fountain of youth. It's like they think that they're going to turn into a 20-year old college co-esd. Seriously, go to the Trans Timeline page and type in ""younger"" as well as the term ""fountain of youth."" You'll find a pretty good amount of posts with that premise that HRT is making them look younger.  It feels like an echo where Tim's mourn their imagined lost ""girlhood"" of sleepovers and pillow fights- like HRT is going to give them a chance to regain their youth and start over again, this time in a body that they want to be in. I think it's interesting from a psychological standpoint. It's also interesting when you consider how society in general tends to treat aging women. Like these Tim's want to transition, but they don't want to do it and be old women- they want to be hot young coeds instead when living out the fantasy."
1059,curiousengineer601,"It really contributes to the delusion it’s possible to transition, the perfect lighting and photo ( plus the online support) makes others think they will ‘pass’.

A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. **Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.**

1070,lord_archimond,Can someone please tell what tv show is this
1071,Aleksanderpwnz,"If by ""natal brain"" you mean the brain of fetuses, then of course male and female fetus' brains are different on average. Male fetuses generate more testosterone, for instance. Although I don't know if there are any consistent, defining ""male"" or ""female"" features of fetus brains."
1072,buddha_did_it,"ok thanks. from what i have read it sounds like there are lots of ways that hormones can affect one's brain and cause, for example, men to show behaviours that are more common in women. 

there is evidence that some men have brains that seem more like a typical woman's brain. there is evidence that some women have brains that seem more like a typical man's brain. the fact that this happens seems to me to suggest that a 'male' brain and a 'female' brain are just averages. in the same way that a man can be 'feminine' in some ways and still be a man, i think that a man's brain can be more like the brain of an average female than that of an average male but still be a man's brain.

i've also read a study which show that homosexuals tend to have brains which more closely resemble the typical brain of a member of the opposite sex. i am gay and i don't think i have a 'female brain' - but it might be the case that in some ways my brain behaves in a way that is less like the average male and more like the average female. i don't know.

 i think there is a chance that the studies which show transgender brains being more like the opposite sex might be showing that because the transgender individuals studied are homosexuals. i dont think that sexuality was considered in those studies and that seems to be a big oversight.

to me, all this just shows that brains are varied and not that gender identity is real. 

anyway, i will read into this more. it is a fascinating topic and i can't say i am an expert on it yet. thank you for the sources."
1073,buddha_did_it,saved by the bell. the text isnt actually from the show - it's just a joke
1074,myradfemexploration,Here’s a question: why are they trying to dispute that? What is the benefit of the ass-backwards arguments about “biological sex” not existing and only “biological gender?
1075,Tranverse,"Thinking hormones, surgery and legal documents makes you 100% identical the sex you identity as is insane. I say that as someone activity transitioning.

But it is a concept that is very much at the heart of TRA friendly ideology. It was one of the main reasons I got turned off from mainstream trans ideologies in the first place."
1076,tuckeredplum,You can dispute anything if you ~~try hard enough~~ say words a bunch
1077,TheVixenJush,"This is true. I’m trans, I accept that I’m s trans women however I also accept that although I pass, I will die as a biological Male. Just as long as I am respected in life and seen as the gender which I truly feel I am. I couldn’t care less."
1078,Ramsden_12,"Because if biological sex doesn’t exist then the legal protections in place for biological females don’t exist either.  Suddenly mediocre men can take women’s places in sports, predatory men can have access to vulnerable women in prisons and voyeristic men are free to access naked women in changing rooms."
1079,throwaway275445,Pure gaslighting.
1080,throwaway275445,"That's because current TRA ideology is mainly targeted at kids. Up to 16 years old kids often really believe they can actually change sex simply due to the way their brain works at that age (if you ever see a person saying this check their age and they are almost always a teen). With neurodivergent people, who are particularly targeted, they often believe this at even older ages. 

They will honestly tell you that hormones rewrite your DNA and SRS changes your sex and really believe it all. It's something to do with their brains putting people in categories based on a few obvious markers rather than being able to grasp the underlying concept, functions and patterns."
1081,Tygere,What a wake up call this comment was.
1082,citrus_slinger,"Exactly. It's a targeted attack to degrade all the progress women have made over the past 100 years regarding their own rights, autonomy and spaces in society. Fuck man, even Obama did a lot of damage to Title IX protections for high school sports."
1083,Tranverse,"As I say, I am transitioning, so I do have belief that the process can bring some pretty drastic changes within the body and ones self that can be positive in some cases, But the ""100% same"", ""Validate my girldick transphobe"" angle is stupid and unworkable.

The problem is Very few trans people are going to openly speak out about this even if they disagree, when the alternative purposed by many to invalidate the concept lumps them wholly and completely with their birth sex no matter what.

It's always going to be an awkward situation unless there is comprise from both sides... Or one side is brow beaten into submission, meaning ultimately the extremists of a particular side win and more resentment is created."
1084,citrus_slinger,"Well yeah, I think this is where many gender critical people are at, this middle ground that you speak of. You can identify however the fuck you want, I really don't care, you're a human being, you deserve the live the life you want, you deserve equal rights and protections. You don't deserve to invade women's spaces, because that is putting your feelings and rights above another's. And you sure as shit don't get to say you're biologically different than what you are. 

If you are a male that identifies as a woman, that's great, you're a male that identifies as a woman, you're not a female. 

I see more militant behavior from TRA than gender critical, considering you can't even have a conversation remotely critical of anything trans. Gender critical people want to have a conversation, but it gets shut down if you don't 100% agree with TRAs, this lack of dialogue is only going to radicalize both sides, but I would say it's on the TRAs to come to the table in good faith for the first fucking time."
1085,adungitit,"I consider the idea that a man can become a woman by superficially imitating and fetishising aspects of womanhood incredibly sexist, but I consider it especially damaging to try and get society on board with that idea and spread that damage, both through popular TIM brainsex tactics and through (more popular with TIFs) trying to sell misogyny and toxic masculinity to people as fun gender identities for roleplaying, because that's easier than working to dismantle them. In a society that's in desperate need of men who see women as relatable human beings, we're telling men that relating to women makes them female. And to women who reject their limited misogynistic gender role, we tell they're men. How is that not backwards and fucked up? The thought of men who have fetishised and idealised womanhood in a typically delusional male way speaking in the name of women after I've heard pretty much all of them speak with their typical patriarchal bias fills me with disgust.

I've been trying to give trans activism a fair-shake, but to me it's like giving trans-racials a fair shake. The very concept is rooted in bigotry and nothing can make it better. When you try to make it better, you get the kinds of mental gymnastics and contradictions libfems engage in. At best you can claim it's a severe mental illness that makes you not think straight, but that really doesn't make the views not-sexist, it only makes them irrational and gives them even less reason to be accepted by society.

I don't want to hold resentment for trans people, but I absolutely can't get over how sexist the whole notion is."
1086,,"Gender Identity types have appropriated the trans struggle, like a Native American headdress at Coachella.  **Then they abuse actual transsexuals as ""truscum"" and ""TERFs.""  That's right, even trans people are TERFs** 

They've also appropriated the identities of intersex people for their ignorant handwaving about sex being arbitrary.  

GI uses trans people as a stalking horse to rewrite everyone else's identities, especially but not only women's.  This is why I think phrases like ""peaktrans"" are a mistake.  It plays into their hands.  

The GI movement seems to be patterned on the anti-abortion movement:  disinformation, intimidation, and the pretense that they are protecting the ultimate victims.  

So, don't let them trap you into talking about trans as your victims.  If you're explaining, you're losing.  Instead, focus on the ignorant babble of GI people and the way they fuck with everyone else's identities.  Don't let GI hide behind their own victims. "
1087,,"It's not just Reddit, it's society at large. Trans-ism is the neoliberal trend du jour. Something I've noticed about American culture in particular is that it seems like hatred itself is never abated, but rather just switched to a new target. Hatred for blacks from time immemorial to the late '70s was transferred onto gays/lesbians in the 80s/90s which was transferred onto Muslims in the '00s which was transferred onto ""TERFs"" in the '10s, etc. Instead of wanting to lynch blacks or ""faggots"", people now want to openly kill ""TERFs"". It's like they don't know what to do if there isn't some nebulous identity-politics enemy to attack."
1088,TheGolden-Hour,"I've always found it odd that queer theory proponents almost never actually defend the idea of gender when debating GC theory. I suppose it's just much easier for them to just define GC as =wants all trans people to die, then it is for them to form an honest argument."
1089,Nibbana0,Guys are surprised by this? Ask any female what it's like to say no to some males or challenge them in any way. 
1090,JulienMayfair,"The more research I do, the more alarming current trends appear to be, particularly the fact that transition does not correlate to positive outcomes. One of the many things that the trans movement has co-opted from the gay movement is the idea that conversion therapy is bad even thought anti-gay conversion therapy and treatment for Gender Identity Disorder are entirely different. Apparently, GID treatment used to be very successful before it was hounded out of existence. 

The fact that they are actively recruiting prepubescent kids for transition is going to have tragic outcomes for a lot of these kids. 

I don't hate trans people, but I haven't known any I can think of who were ultimately very happy after the transition. "
1091,,I have had a thread removed and just now banned from Bestofoutrageculture.  It's rare to find a single community anywhere on social media that allows an opposing point of view.

I consider myself a radical feminist ally so it's no barrier to me participating, but my girlfriend and several of my guy friends don't want to call themselves gender critical because they assume they'll be seen as radical feminists."
1093,Peach_Muffin,"The problem is that there truly are GC people who hate trans people. The ones who think that all trans people are rapists and pedophiles. They regularly receive upvotes on the main sub, too. "

And it's not just gender related discussions where this is happening. It's a culmination of the 24-hour news cycle. Nuanced opinion is diminished in favor of outrage, and if your entire opinion can't fit into two sentences, it's worthless. Likewise, having an opinion that puts you into a box means that you take *every* opinion of that box, or get ejected from the box.

The very idea that there's more to gender discussion than a binary absolute love or hatred, is kinda like thinking a democrat who supports abortion exists. *It's just not talked about.*"

This has me terrified. I'm a first-time father of a 6-month-old girl. Recently in the course of a conversation back-and-forth my wife replied to something I said to the effect of, ""well, unless she turns out to be a boy"". 

I immediately said, ""You know, I've been thinking about this stuff a lot lately. And no, she won't be a boy. She can be a tomboy, she can be a lesbian (God I hope she's a lesbian so she can avoid men), she can be bi, anything she *is* will be affirmed and loved in our house. But she can't change her sex.""

1136,BobBaxter64,"My daughter is Lesbian, now 23. While still at school (14-17) she was very much 'trans-orthodox' in her thinking - she used to get furious with me if I mentioned mental ill-health as a possible underlying factor. She was very supportive of a gay male classmate as he began to 'transition'. She was a true believer. 

She now feels strongly that if she had just been two or three years later finishing school she might well have got mixed up in all this. Now it's her who has educated me about the full extent of the madness. We've talked about how I would have reacted if she'd gone down the medical path. This would have been me - jail and handcuffs! 

But speaking the truth is part of showing your love  for your child - and we can only hope that in the long run they will appreciate that we wore our hearts on our sleeves and told them 'don't change you're so lovely as you are'.

This is devastating. Canada is frightening on this issue. Other places could go this way. We should do what we can to stop it.

On a positive note I am beginning to think this stuff has peaked. They blindsided everyone for a while but the reaction is very much setting in.

[Wow](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5227946/).
1192,BenderRodriguez9,"To put this in perspective, u/moonflower:

 There are 151.8 million adult men in the US, 3.9% of whom identify as gay/bi. That means 5.92 million gay/bi men. 59.7% of 1447 = 864 hate crimes were motivated by anti-gay-male hatred (of which bi men can also be targets). So that's 864/5920000 = 0.01459% of gay/bi men have been targeted for hate crimes in 2018.

There are 1.4 million trans people in the US with 189 ""gender identity bias"" crimes. So thats 189/1400000 = 0.0135% of trans people targeted for hate crimes in 2018.

Note: I'm leaving out the 24.9% of crimes that were ""generally against all LGBT people"" because there's no way to tell how much of each group is represented there, as well as the 1.5% of crimes that were specifically due to ""biphobia"" since it doesn't specify male or female.

In any event, even though both numbers are extremely low (yay!), there were still, per capita, more hate crimes against gay/bi men than *all of the trans community combined.*"
1193,moonflower,"You could perhaps hold off on the sarcasm and read more carefully what I said. Although, to give you the benefit of the doubt, I did read it again myself and think there is a section which is ambiguous - so, to clarify, when I said ""or how to even find those numbers"" I didn't mean *my* inability to use google, I meant the *researchers* difficulty in finding the numbers of people who would accurately fit their criteria for what they count as ''transgender''.

And if their criteria is ''anyone who identifies as transgender'', then how meaningful is that in relation to the crime statistics? What percentage of ''transgender'' people are *perceived as* transgender by the potential criminals?"
1194,tinycommunist,"0.01459% vs. 0.0135% is margin of error with so few (reported) cases, plus the ""all of the trans community combined"" thing actually works against you. males are more likely to be victims of violent, non-sexual hate crime across the board, so including female trans people in your comparison brings the percentage down."
1195,BenderRodriguez9,"Don't complain about sarcasm, Moonflower, when you put ""well known"" statistics in scare quotes, despite the fact that the Williams Institute Survey is one of the most widely cited and easily available statistics on this topic to be found with 5 seconds of googling. It is by any reasonable definition ""well known"".

And yes, their criteria is ""people who say they're trans"" which is the same criteria used by the other linked survey to determine the percentage of the population that is LGB. So it's the same metrics, with the same potential pitfalls, for both groups. But just because that caveat exists doesn't mean the statistics aren't there, or that they're unreliable.

Anyway, considering how 90% of the arguments you get into on this sub involve you stating that the other party has misread your comment somehow, perhaps you should reflect on the common denominator in all of these exchanges."
1196,BenderRodriguez9,"No, it doesn't ""work against me"", because my point is arguing against the notion that ""cis gays"" have ""got theirs already"" and that the trans community as a whole is targeted more for hate crimes and violence. The fact that ""cis"" gay men experience a higher percentage of hate crimes than trans people do disproves that woke dogma. I don't need to do a specific comparison of gay men vs transwomen or gay men vs male NB people to make that point."
1197,moonflower,"I wasn't using ""scare quotes"", I was using *actual quotes* because I was quoting you. I do that a lot - I quote people and use quote marks to indicate that I am using their own terms. There was no sinister implication. I'm pretty open when I'm accusing people of something - like when I was accusing you of using unnecessary sarcasm. There was no sarcasm in my reply.

And yes, after making my comment, I did think about the similar problem regarding the compilation of statistics of both groups - because the only meaningful statistics would be 'crimes per capita of those who are *perceived* as belonging to that category'.

I thought of this illustration: if there was a group of 1000 men, and 50 of those men were homosexual, and a raging homophobic hate-criminal came along looking for victims, and if he perceived 5 of the men to be homosexual, and unleashed his homophobic wrath upon them, then the statistics would say 10% of homosexual men were the victims of homophobic hate crime - but in the mind of the criminal, 100% of homosexual men were the victims of homophobic hate crime.

It's the same with transgender hate crimes - first, a person must be *perceived* as transgender before they can be the victim of the transphobic crime - so these kinds of statistics are impossible to gather and compare in any accurate and meaningful way. 

Anyway, since you mention my arguments and blame me for other people's misunderstandings - how are the mods getting on with amending the subreddit rules? I see the sidebar hasn't changed yet, it's still displaying the false information. It would only take a few seconds to fix it."

It doesn't really matter what was in the mind of the criminal, all that matters is in the end, what percentage of the gay population was targeted, so the meaningful statistic here is 10%.

> so these kinds of statistics are impossible to gather and compare in any accurate and meaningful way.

Intuitively I would expect P(being perceived to be transgender | while not being trans gender) and P(being perceived to be gay | while not being gay) to both be rather low - meaning that that the majority of people being perceived to be gay and being perceived to be trans, are in fact gay or trans, so I don't think there are many false positives here that would skew the statistics so severely that it makes data collection ""impossible"".

> Anyway, since you mention my arguments and blame me for other people's misunderstandings - how are the mods getting on with amending the subreddit rules? I see the sidebar hasn't changed yet, it's still displaying the false information. It would only take a few seconds to fix it.

There's nothing ""false"" in the rules - you claim that your comments get ""angrily removed"" (how would you even know the emotions being felt when removing a comment?) despite being within the rules for ""people who are new to feminist ideas to ask questions"" but you're not new to this conversation. You've been around Reddit for years, long enough to be banned from literally every other GC sub in existence, so why would that part of the guidelines apply to you?

We will be updating the sidebar to be a bit more comprehensive, yes, but please note Moonflower that you're literally the only person out of thousands who has ever messaged us out of confusion as to what the sidebar allows. Maybe you should wonder why that is."
1200,BenderRodriguez9,"Even if you truncated the percentages to the first 2 decimal points, the numbers still prove my point...that the notion that trans people are targeted for hate crimes more than ""cis"" gay men, is false."
1201,moonflower,"If I ""reevaluated my writing style"" (see, I'm quoting you there, therefore using quote marks) every time someone complained about it, I would eventually never write anything at all, because there's *always* someone ready to complain and misunderstand and be offended, no matter what I say and how I say it.

Also, you are on a roll of blaming the victim there, asking me to blame myself when your sidebar rules don't match your actual moderation behaviours. 

I consider myself to be *very* new to learning about radical feminism - and it's a very long and slow process to learn anything when I keep getting shut down, censored and banned when I try to discuss it. The attitude of almost all the radical feminist subreddit communities is that newcomers must accept the seemingly contradictory statements without question, and shut up and go away if they have any further questions.

Then you have the audacity to say ""This is also a space for people who are new to feminist ideas and who are looking to ask questions, discuss ideas and get feedback""

Perhaps you could add ""... as long as you only ask *one question* and then shut up and go away if the answers are unsatisfactory and lead to further questions"".

Anyway, back to the topic - I think what is in the mind of the criminal is a pretty significant factor when compiling statistics. I think in the illustration I gave, it would be misleading to say ""10% of homosexual men were the victims of homophobic hate crime"" and more meaningful to say ""100% of men who were perceived to be homosexual were the victims of homophobic hate crime."""

1272,Ikilledyvette,"Full Text: Tax expert Maya Forstater fired for saying trans women aren’t women
A senior researcher at a think tank is taking her former boss to court after she was accused of offensive language

An internationally renowned researcher on tax avoidance is believed to be the first person in Britain to lose her job for saying that transgender women are not women.

Maya Forstater, 45, was told by her managers that she had used “offensive and exclusionary” language.

She was accused of “fear-mongering” for tweeting her concerns about government proposals to allow people to legally self-identify as the opposite sex.

Forstater has begun employment tribunal proceedings against her former employer, the London office of the Centre for Global Development (CGD) think tank. She hopes it will be a test case establishing that “gender-critical” views — which hold that being a woman is a biological fact, not a feeling — are protected beliefs under equality law. She is starting an appeal on the Crowdjustice website to raise £30,000 for the action.

Forstater said: “I support transgender people’s human rights and I believe that trans people are vulnerable, but no one group should overrerule others. I lost my job for speaking up about women’s rights, in a careful way and in a tone of ordinary discussion and disagreement. I worked for a think tank and I thought you ought to be able to think and talk about things. I found out I was wrong about that.”

She is backed by Index on Censorship, whose director, Jodie Ginsberg, said: “From what I have read of her writing, I cannot see that Maya has done anything wrong other than express an opinion that many feminists share — that there should be a public and open debate about the distinction between sex and gender.”"
1273,NebulousWaffles,"It's insanity, and unfortunately criticism can be quashed due to the statute on speech-based hate crime being based on wether or not someone is offended, rather than on the actual intent or proof of intent. Meaning you can go to jail for someone being offended at what a person says, regardless of the intention or what is actually said.

This is the ridiculous paranoia present nowadays in the UK, where you're more likely to get arrested for what you say online than committing sex offences because the police will literally go after wrongthink more than a rapist, especially if you're the wrong colour on the ridiculous diversity colour wheel heirarchy that's purported around as the be-all and end-all nowadays.

Socially speaking this makes Transsexuals and even non-binary folks have a massive amount of power over anyone who even deigns to disagree or criticise their reactionary, emotional rhetoric that everyone is out to get them and they must take priority over literally every other group in a intersectionality food chain, with Caucasian CIS people at the bottom since exploiting biased systems is the only way they ever feel power over others."

It only reinforces my convictions that we need to push back harder than ever before."

1291,alter_ego666,"Gender dysphoria cannot be 'cured.' Trans people can't just accept their bodies; if only it were that easy.
Also, I'm not sure you fully understand the medical definition of the term 'gender dysphoria.' Basically, it's the medical term for 'trans,' meaning that it is used to refer to individuals whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. If you're still unsure of the implications of this condition, feel free to consult the DSM-V for further information.
Being trans is very different from being gay. Gender identity (who you are) is in fact completely separate from sexuality (who you are attracted to). The only difference is the label that an individual uses to describe this gender identity and sexuality. For example, a trans man (someone born with female reproductive organs who identifies as a man) who is attracted to women would identify as straight, even though, before their transition, they might have identified as a lesbian."
1292,sunrarkestra,"The dynamic of adult trans people grooming vulnerable children into transgenderism, instead of helping them understand that they are okay the way they are

1293,Bunnies_and_Anarchy,"Honestly it seems incredibly likely to me that there are pedophiles posing as trans people in online communities in order to help convince more children and teens especially that they are trans. Puberty blockers halt puberty and confused teenagers (with increased independence compared to younger children) are likely more easily convinced to meet up with an older man for sex.

Thinking of the old ""trap threads"" on 4chan along with all of its disgusting loli/etc. porn and all the reports of child porn on Tumblr is what made me initially very suspicious of it. Those are the two places from which transgenderism sprung into popularity over the past 15 years or so. This meme just encapsulates the picture dankly.

It's pretty obvious on egg_irl and other places that there is a significant push inside online trans communities and elsewhere to convince others that they're actually trans. I'm sure many are just doing it to further validate their identities or perhaps even out of genuine attempts to help. But I'm willing to bet that pedophiles are using it to groom and molest children and teenagers especially.

And given the social pressure put on institutions, especially in more progressive countries like the UK, it's easy to see how it wouldn't be actively investigated with the vigor usually invested in child sex abuse cases."
1294,Bunnies_and_Anarchy,"It's not referring to all trans people. It's referring specifically to those who promote ""Protect Trans Kids"", who may or not even be trans. They advocate for children to be given puberty blockers, even against their parents wishes.

It's incredibly likely that pedophiles are in this movement and also on social media encouraging confused children and teenagers that they're trans. Just look at r/egg_irl. Other trans communities on Reddit, Tumblr, Facebook and even areas of 4chan are similar with suggesting to anyone who indicates gender confusion that they are likely trans. Despite it being such a rare condition. If you want to see statistics, look at the huge jump in the number of people on hormones and scheduling/undergoing genital surgeries.

I can only imagine what is being said and encouraged in Discord chats and other, less visible online organizations. It's very likely that some of them, legitimately trans or not, are adults encouraging children and especially teenagers that they are trans for the purpose of grooming them into taking puberty blockers, which are honestly a pedophile's dream. They stunt the development of teenagers and keep them pubescent. Their increased freedom as a teenager makes it much easier for older men to arrange to meet for sex.

As for your statistics, I imagine we'll see a change in 5-10 years once these children are adults and feel more confident to report the grooming that occurred. It's just sad that children will need to be sacrificed in the name of being ""woke"" before we can see the harm that this shit does to already identity-confused teenagers.

And I find it incredibly interesting that you made your account today to specifically make this comment. I wonder what your main account looks like."

1297,Jo_in_TN,"There are children who do desist from transitioning and who do adjust to their bodies.  These would be girls who hate their bodies and do not want to sexually develop, girls who have experienced sexual abuse, girls who are actually lesbians, bascially children who are unhappy with their bodies but don't necessarily have  the type of dysphoria that would persist a lifetime.

The problem is that we don't know which children will desist and and which children will go on to transition,  but we do know that children who take hormone blockers are much more likely to continue on to transition.  They are like Jazz Jennings - at seventeen they still haven't had one sexual feeling.  They don't go through the exploration of feelings that most teens do, and if they are gay or lesbian, don't get to come to terms with their sexual desire for the same sex.

These are the detransitioners we now read about, and most of them were FtM.  Unfortunately, many have had double mastectomies,  and now have deep voices and facial hair.

1303,alter_ego666,"That's why gender therapists exist.

Medically, it has been found that children are aware of their gender identity at about five years of age. However, if an environment alters that awareness (like in cases of sexual abuse or transphobia, to name only two), a gender therapist could easily know what would be best for the child, whether that's to start taking hormone blockers to facilitate later transition, or to hold off a bit longer just in case.

Though detransitioners exist, they should not be an excuse to further hurt and repress other trans people."
1304,alter_ego666,"Gender non-conformity and gender dysphoria are very different topics. While the former term refers to one's unwillingness to act as ""expected"" on the basis of gender, the latter is a disorder studied medically. To put it simply (for clarification on this issue, the DSM5 might be a useful source), gender dysphoria has nothing to do with sexist stereotypes. For example, a trans woman could chose to dress and / or behave in a manner more typically associated with masculinity, and vice-versa.

This is not an attempt to reinforce stereotypes. All trans people ask is for you to respect their name and pronouns. I don't see how accepting them is somehow problematic."
1305,SometimesJacka,"Children don’t really get an identity apart from their parents until 5 to 7. If children have a gender identity at or before 5, it’s the one their parents 100% imposed on them.

1306,KingOfTheCIS,Yes but how does their inability to accept their bodies translate into my obligation to accept them?
1307,alter_ego666,"But hormone blockers wouldn't be administered anyway, unless the child has a condition which induces premature puberty, in which case, cis or trans, hormone blockers would be administered.

Usually, a child can start taking hormone blockers when they start showing signs of puberty."
1308,alter_ego666,"It isn't an obligation to accept them. But it's the humane thing to do. Because accepting someone just means acknowledging their existence, respecting their rights, and letting them be.

Unfortunately, undermining trans people's identities goes against all of that."
1309,SometimesJacka,"I’m totally against hormone blockers for children beyond those extreme life saving (not trans related) treatments. 


My academic work was in psychology & human development. I focused in adolescent development primarily. From my knowledge of development and how the psych field / social sciences work, I do not believe “gender therapists” are likely operating on the best interests of the children.

I don’t really want to argue about this to be quite honest, but I wanted to be clear that no young child understands gender identity. They’ll understand that as a girl if they wear pink they’ll get more positive feedback or that the pink section of the store is where the toys advertised for her will be."

I could imagine TiMs doing lower body exercises in hopes of getting thicker thighs and butt.  (Not that it’s that effective, as shown).  Maybe they got inspired by being strong compared to women rather than average to weak compared to other men, who knows. 

It also has to be said that it’s a small study.

Edit:  not just imagine, I know so.  On a regular basis, there’ll be a post from a TiM on the “strong curves” reddit.

Liberal women support female rights in theory, but they're willing to delude themselves to an extraordinary degree and give men the benefit of a doubt that they don't deserve and continuously abuse.

anyway the idea that children are being Transed©️®️ is literally a rehashing of homophobic stereotypes- namely the idea that if you let gay people anywhere near your kids they'll be turned gay. if your kids see a gay person on tv, they'll turn gay. gay kids with gay parents are gay because of their parents. gay men sneak into bathrooms with little boys to assault them. it's obvious to anyone over the age of 9. stop acting like 'x group wants to turn your kids into x' is a brand new idea, a reaction to a threat, and not something that has existed since there's been kids and groups."

Kids are very impressionable and if someone they look up to, especially their parents but possibly also people in their peergroup tell them they are trans, they might believe that for a while even if they are not. If for example a teenaged boy later finds out, that he isn't actually trans, but he already has a neovagina or his health is damaged by the drugs he was taking, this is a much different ballpark than if he would find out, that he isn't actually gay after he kissed another boy or something like that.

1357,XtinaInnit,Exact same arguement is used against gay people and against lowering the age of consent and gay marriage in the UK. Your arguement is just homophobia with a new coat of paint.
1358,dadvenom,"none of that stuff is the issue you guys seem to think it is. 
children and teens are not free to access medical transition on a whim. GD therapy for children involves making sure that the child- not the parent- is consistent, insistent, and persistent about being whatever gender. most often, the only step in transitioning that a child will take is getting a new wardrobe and pronouns. 

can a minor take hormones/puberty blockers? absolutely. but those things (not to mention SRS) are difficult as hell to get even as an adult. they usually require months or years of therapy, and that's if you have access to them. in my current location, i would literally have to travel to a different state to access HRT. there are places like planned parenthood who will allow you to access HRT without therapy, but 1. not all planned parenthoods do this 2. people may not have access to those types of places. 

children are impressionable, but like i said, children must be consistent, insistent, and persistent about their gender. this argument is always presented as though a child can go ""daddy I'm a girl now"" and immediately be put on both hormones and puberty blockers and be in line for SRS. in reality, like i said, transitioning is a process that takes time no matter who you are. 

another thing you guys seem to think is a huge problem is parents/peers forcing/influencing children to be trans. based on my own personal experiences, the experiences of several of my trans friends, and other people's experiences that I've read about, transgender people are much, much more likely to encounter harassment and hatred than they are to encounter encouragement or force. i was never influenced to become transgender, but i have been influenced to become cisgender, either by someone directly telling me i should be cis, or by bullying and harassment. ive got like four friends whose parents began buying 'girl' or 'boy' clothes for them after they came out in an attempt to influence them to stop being transgender. 

and I'll let you in on a secret: being transgender does not require any amount of medical transition. both cisgender and transgender people push the idea that you need to use x hormones, get x surgery, or look x way in order to Actually be a man/woman. if we as a society stopped pushing the idea that bodies have to look a certain way, less transgender people would medically transition. i have no interest in SRS. i was told by another trans person that I'm actually cis if i don't want SRS. he got that idea from living in a society that tells him that men have to have 
penises. 

anyway, you can be concerned about the long term effects of hormones (as a lot of trans people, including myself, are) and about detransitioning (again, as a lot of us are) without perpetuating the myth that transgender people are deliberately trying to turn children trans- because that's what this is. you are perpetuating a harmful lie that presents transgender people as predators, purposefully hunting down kids to Trans™️ for no apparent reason. it is very much the same as the old stereotype that gay people will turn your kids gay. it is literally identical, except with the subjects switched."
1359,somewhereinside,"No kids are given operations, no teenager would be ""given a neovagina"".

 Blockers require seeing a medical professional and the consent of a guardian/parent. Blockers don't really ""change your body in a big way"", if anything, they prevent big changes from puberty so the child has more time to come to the decision on whether they are trans or not."
1360,TranssexualScum,"Quick to assume about me, eh? I’m actually working towards detransition because I know actually being a woman is entirely impossible and living a delusion believing I somehow could be definitely isn’t the way to help deal with my dysphoria. Next time don’t assume, mkay?

Also yeah, there totally are minor differences between boys and girls but other then the obvious genitals, and the psychological differences from socialization. My point is that the rest are insignificant enough to not have an effect on the individual’s passibility. My evidence for this are things such as girls and boys sports categories having little variation until puberty, all of the large skeletal changes that primarily cue “female” or “male” happen based off of sex hormones, radical feminists believe that children aren’t born innately masculine or feminine it all comes from socialization and socialization can be undone, and finally children who are GNC often already do look like the opposite sex I have experience with being assumed to be female and I have assumed more than one child’s sexual incorrectly due to them being GNC. So anyway the burden falls to you (it already was on you because a positive statement is the one that has the burden of proof, and not the negative statement) do you have significant compelling evidence that there are large enough differences in childhood to make passing after going through the opposite sex’s puberty impossible?

1364,DistantGlimmer,"We see examples of ""egg groups"" trying to convince impressionable young kids that they should transition.  You'll probably say that's ""just a joke"" or something but when you have significantly older people telling these things to young kids who are already confused about their identity it can have very serious consequences. To be clear here, I do not actually think the transition is a good idea even for adults. Men can't become women. It simply is living a misogynistic lie to believe that hormones and surgery can actually change your body in this way or that human beings don't have identities defined to a large extent by their biology.

However, realistically there's nothing I can do to stop adults who are determined from damaging their own bodies. However, children cannot legally consent to this and puberty blockers have extremely dangerous side effects. We do not know the  full long term effects of blocking puberty either. These are just experiments on kids that are making drug companies a fortune. It's completely abusive."
1365,Tarsiustarsier,"The process seems to go wrong quite often though, or do you think the people on r/detrans are all lying? I have read a few stories where they said access to medication was way too easy and the therapy was a joke and they were pretty much just waved through. Also I have seen quite the push to make access towards getting surgery and medication easier. 

It makes sense, that transwomen for example would want to look female. Our disagreement here boils down to the definitions of man and woman. Until very recently the official definitions of woman and man were female and male adult human being. Being biologically male means producing or having produced sperm at some point in your life and being biologically female means being born with eggcells. The former means you likely have a penis, the latter means you probably have a vagina. There are a few cases where this isn't as clearcut, sometimes people's outside sexual organs look like the other sex or they have no functional sexual organs but look like either a man or a women and to make everything easier for everyone people call them woman or man according to their appearance. As far as I can tell there aren't any people who can produce eggs and sperm so there isn't really a third category here.

Even though there is a little bit of uncertainty with these definitions, all definitions I have heard from trans activists make much less sense e.g.  everyone who identifies as a man is a man is a circular definition. 

There is also the problem, that if we let self identification be the only deciding factor of whether someone is a man or a woman, every male person could just self identify as a woman and go into every women's only space. Which I find especially problematic for women's shelters, as well as prisons."
1366,Tarsiustarsier,"Some teenagers are given operations though. An example is Susie Green the CEO of Mermaids who took her child to Thailand for the medical operation on their sixteenth birthday (the laws in Thailand have tightened since then though). The point is that there are very prominent trans activists publicly promoting this kind of thing.
 
As far as I can tell puberty blockers are in a kind of experimental state right now and we don't know how longlasting their effects similarily (but probably worse) for hormone treatment."

No, they’re not minor at all actually. You clearly have some skewed views on this.

Hmm.. what? Also:

Oh lord here we go folks  

>and finally children who are GNC often already do look like the opposite sex 

That is absolutely not true. Being gender non conforming has nothing to do with how you look, it has to do with how little fucks you give about gender roles. You could be the most womanly looking woman ever or the most macho looking guy and still be GNC. 

>I have experience with being assumed to be female and I have assumed more than one child’s sexual incorrectly due to them being GNC. 

Are you confusing being “non binary” or simply androgynous with being GNC? Because I see trans identified people do this a lot, it’s not the same thing. 

>do you have significant compelling evidence that there are large enough differences in childhood to make passing after going through the opposite sex’s puberty impossible?

Chromosomes perhaps? Eyeballs maybe? Pumping a kid with hormones will never reverse their sex, by default it’s literally causing harm to either a male or a female. Males who don’t get to actually develop the way they were supposed to end up looking like exactly what they are.. males who did not develop the way they were supposed to. Same for women. And if you want me to be brutally honest: they look weak, and I mean weak as in ill.. from a health perspective, because essentially that’s exactly what it is. 

It’s the same thing on and on again with these “passing” discussions. Angles, clothes and plastic surgery still don’t make up for actual anatomy. A child (who happens to have less obvious secondary sex characteristics) still isn’t some blank sexless canvas.

>Oh, and by the way, I wanted to give you a friendly tip: don’t use someone’s username and flair to make assumptions about a person’s life that you use to justify they aren’t worth your time, u/Methdealer69

Yes you will. If my username was “loliislife69”, “trumpismysavior” or “Ifuckinghatewomen” you’d make assumptions of who I am because of how I chose to present myself. You have eyes and a brain, you can’t choose not to make assumptions based off what you see. It’s literally what keeps us alive."

1371,Methdealer69,I disagree with you 100%.
1372,TranssexualScum,"Okay I know that this isn’t an argument that I should be starting at all, but like, if a child especially a boy doesn’t start hormones before they’re done puberty then what’s even the point? Like I get how terrible it is to be pushing this stuff as a treatment when it really isn’t much more than a cosmetic thing to boost confidence. And yeah I’m sure that it’s possible to boost dysphoric kids’ confidence without transitioning but reflecting on the experience that transition has given me and the effects that it’s had on me I can see pretty confidently that it has helped me be able to accept the person I am. I definitely don’t think transitioning should be the first choice, but if a child is having a lot of difficulty gaining self confidence due to sex dysphoria and they aren’t developing normal things like a sexuality from puberty then maybe slowly changing their body to make it easier to find things they like about it can be a good option. Then once they’ve been able to find enough things for them to actually feel confident in their skin they can start being shown that the parts of them that are really making them dysphoric aren’t really so bad. Unintentionally this is the route that I’m on. If I were being guided by a professional therapist who can show me this stuff and how to do it then maybe I would’ve been able to get over this earlier and been given easier opportunities to succeed in school and in my teen years. And especially for people like me who didn’t even develop the slightest bit of a sexuality until being on hormones there isn’t too much to lose from the potential sterilization. Also if the child is feeling confident about their body from the features that developed as a result of HRT then those become some of the fundamental things that they can go back to and feel confident about where as with natural development they become things that they think about and have their confidence and self worth destroyed.

Also anyone reading this don’t just say “well therapy should be able to help people accept the natural sexed features of their body” unless you’ve had legitimate sex dysphoria yourself. Sex dysphoria doesn’t have a simple answer or a simple solution and it really is hell to live through and feels like a huge truck on the highway headed in your direction if you want to fight it. It is a losing battle unless you strategically choose how to fight it, and perhaps the best way is to try to go in the same direction as it to slow it down bit by bit.

you guys are ALWAYS bringing up the whole ""transitioning is an experiment! drug companies are just trying to make money off of you!"" argument like it means anything. 1. while medical transition isn't insanely well researched, no aspect of it is an 'experiment.' HRT was literally created for cis people. 2. if this was about corrupt drug companies profiting off of vulnerable people, you wouldn't say that those vulnerable people are 'living a misogynistic lie.' 3. drug companies do *everything* for profit. and yet you guys don't complain about the ludicrous cost of any drug except the ones the transes take."

i don't understand why 'anyone who identifies as a man is a man' is such a wild thing to say? man and woman are social constructs that have different meanings based on your place and time.  in the 1900s homosexuals were considered a third sex. butch lesbians weren't (and aren't) considered women because of their masculinity and attraction to women. the same goes for gay men. 

""but if we let people self identify, men will say they're women and go into women's only spaces!!!"" a couple things:
1. if a dude wants to assault a woman, he doesn't have to put on a dress Bugs Bunny style and sneak into a Sacred Women's Space. it's so convoluted.
2. there are already men in prisons assaulting women and they aren't even pretending to be women- the guards. they do it a lot, mostly without repercussions. I'm so tired of seeing fucking prison presented as some kind of sacred female-only space. it's prison. the female inmates are in danger of assault from *other female inmates*. 
3. i saw this floated around by a lesbian i know- lesbians and bisexual women can also abuse their partners. a woman who was abused by another woman probably won't feel 100% safe in a woman only space."
1375,somewhereinside,"I sincerely hope Ms Green was removed from Mermaids because of that.

I have also heard of one trans teen given HRT years before they should have. Not because they were pushed into it by trans activists, but because their mother went against her country's laws to get them. To make matters worse, that teen came to the decision they weren't trans and and to detransition rather than just stop taking puberty blockers.

These are examples of irresponsible people negatively impacting the lives of young people who are questioning their gender identity. As individuals these people should be condemned or even punished for what they did to the children. 

However I haven't seen this as a whole in the trans community with my own experiences as a transgender teen. In fact, when I told people about my wishes to transition behind my parents and the NHS's wishes and regulations everyone I mentioned it to told me how that was a bad idea and possibly damaging to my mental and physical health in the long run.

Linking back to the post OP has referenced, I wouldn't consider that pressuring trans youths or questioning youths to rush through transitioning, but that no matter how old you get you didn't make a mistake from waiting. 

In my opinion, I find the critique of trans woman's appearances on ""gender critical"" subs and forums to be highly pressuring to transition early: to escape the broad shoulders, masculinized face shape and other features that only get worse as puberty progresses."

These people are porn-sick and it’s completely about how they look to them. I think you nailed it on the head about gender roles and I feel like you’ve helped me put a pin in something I’ve been feeling without a way to explain it. Thank you.
1378,TranssexualScum,">No, they’re not minor at all actually. You clearly have some skewed views on this.

I’m talking about perceivable differences that can’t be overshadowed by having one’s bones structure and fat distribution develop as though they were the opposite sex. I’m willing to say that I’ve been exposed to information that skews my views one way, but without an actual example that either has a linked source or that I could go out and see for myself it’s a little difficult for me to change my beliefs. I generally don’t believe things off of blind faith.

>That is absolutely not true. Being gender non conforming has nothing to do with how you look, it has to do with how little fucks you give about gender roles. You could be the most womanly looking woman ever or the most macho looking guy and still be GNC.

Yeah but often in children GNC tendencies manifest in their looks, and especially their hair. The main way I actually tell the sex of a child though is based off of how they act. Generally children will be very prone to falling in line with their socialization, but if one were to not care about gender roles and be foregoing actions typically of their sex’s socialization then it’s basically impossible to tell.

>Are you confusing being “non binary” or simply androgynous with being GNC? Because I see trans identified people do this a lot, it’s not the same thing.

I think I’ve largely responded in my last point but to make it clear: no. I am legit GNC in the way I exist in the world, and I also was when I was a child. I wasn’t quite as GNC as a child because I was overwhelmed by social pressures but I did break off from my socialization a bit.

>Chromosomes perhaps?

I can’t tell a person’s chromosomes by merely looking at them. Yeah the chromosomes they have and more specifically the gene expressions within them have an effect on basically every part of life and development. But I haven’t seen evidence that that effects is significant enough to counteract the even more prevalent effects of hormones. Genes can only do so much there are many more significant things that can have an effect on a person’s appearance.

>Eyeballs maybe?

I did a quick google search of sex differences in the eye, and no we cannot observe the differences in cone cells in each other’s eyes. So unless there’s some lesser known size or shape difference that you’re referring to and can link me to, I’m not sure this idea works the way you want it to.

>Pumping a kid with hormones will never reverse their sex

I 100% agree. But remember this discussion isn’t about whether an individual’s sex actually changes but whether people perceive them as the opposite sex in society.

>it’s literally causing harm to either a male or a female

I agree with that too. It is directly harmful to the physical well-being of the individual to do this. I’d argue that benefits to mental wellbeing can in very rare cases justify it for either a short time or while it’s closely monitored though. I feel that way because I have found the mental benefits to work quite well for myself. I still feel betrayed with the implication that somehow they would make me a woman, and I feel manipulated into doing things that I never would’ve done had I known I was merely having a delusion supported, but even though I hate the system and how I got here and everything surrounding it, the results have helped. Before “transition” I never would’ve thought that I could limit my dysphoria to a manageable point, but now I have an I’m considering detransition in order to further my health even more. Anyway mini tangent over I’ll go back to responding.

>Males who don’t get to actually develop the way they were supposed to end up looking like exactly what they are.. males who did not develop the way they were supposed to. Same for women.

>It’s the same thing on and on again with these “passing” discussions. Angles, clothes and plastic surgery still don’t make up for actual anatomy.

Yeah, and I’m not arguing that it does. Sure I “pass” in certain lightings and environments and from certain angles, but I definitely don’t think that changes my sex or means that I universally “pass”. I get how frustrating it is to see trans people act like each other “pass” when we all know they don’t and it’s just a lie they’re telling each other to keep them in the cult.

I actually called myself TranssexualScum because that is what I’d be called by most trans communities. I wanted an anonymous account where I could talk about this stuff without me as a person risking my life being ruined by going so far against what is mainstream. I’ve only made one post on a “trans subreddit” using this account, and that sub was r/asktransgender and my post was asking why they don’t interact or engage with GC ideas. It was deleted within 3 hours. I’m 99% sure it was deleted because they could tell from my post and comment history that I was deprogrammed by GC feminism and they didn’t want me doing that to others. Yeah I’m biased, I suffer from a horrible mental illness that will make it impossible for me to have the same quality of life as everyone else. Of course I’d be biased to find any way available to fix it. But I’m not biased in the way you think. I’m biased in the way that men would be biased against a bill ordering them all to go off to a pointless traumatic war. So yeah, just maybe consider that when judging a person by their username.

>Yes you will. If my username was “loliislife69”, “trumpismysavior” or “Ifuckinghatewomen” you’d make assumptions of who I am because of how I chose to present myself. You have eyes and a brain, you can’t choose not to make assumptions based off what you see. It’s literally what keeps us alive.

Oh yeah I 100% have negative impressions of all those users based off their usernames, just like I have a negative impression of a person calling themselves methdealer69. The thing is if they wanted to interact and argue with me I’d at least give them a chance to prove me wrong. I’ve argued with actually trump supporters and while I may think they are horribly misguided, I will hear them out and try to supportively help them see the problems in their views. I’m not going to give up on people just because they are objectively bad at this point in time. If I can make them less bad, and show them that there is an actual problem with their thinking then I will. Giving someone a disgusted side eye and then walking away doesn’t serve any purpose other than making the individual bitter. Anyway I’ll leave this here.

I truthfully don't know the best way to help kids who are truly dysphoric. I just worry that it is extremely dangerous to be assuming kids are dysphoric and expecting them to be able to articulate that at a young age when these issues are very complex even for adults to  understand.

I totally  agree that I  cannot at all understand what sex dysphoria feels like but do you not worry about kids being encouraged to transition when they actually just be GNC and/or gay. I really do not trust all therapists out there to be as thoughtful about it as you are. Especially as I ffeel there is an agenda being pushed and big profits involved with this.  I think at the very least more serious research needs to be done and strict guidelines need to be developed but the reality is that it seems transition is being pushed as the first option right now.


I would love to see your experience become somewhat of a model for people with dysphoria as you manage to cope with it without claiming you are a woman or invading women's spaces."

1384,DistantGlimmer,"We've seen examples of the egg groups. It gets posted here a lot on here and similar groups when it happens.

No one has to tell kids they might be gay because it is something that is inborn. No one is going to talk you into being gay if you're not.  Transitioning is a choice people make and dysphoria is very hard to actually define especially for a child.  

>if this was about corrupt drug companies profiting off of vulnerable people, you wouldn't say that those vulnerable people are 'living a misogynistic lie.'

Why? I think the lie is being sold to vulnerable people as a way to help the drug companies to make money. Dysphoria may be real but it doesn't require you to actually pretend you're a woman to deal with it. That is colonizing women's identities. Women are adult human females, not just anyone who wants to identify as a woman. To claim anything else is misogynistic and wrong as well as being a lie. 

>drug companies do everything for profit. and yet you guys don't complain about the ludicrous cost of any drug 

Who says ""we"" don't? I'm not a fan of drug companies in general and agree a lot of drugs are over-priced and health care and pharmacare should not be privatized. Seems more to be TRAs who are really helping and supporting the drug companies here."
1385,Tarsiustarsier,"> i don't understand why 'anyone who identifies as a man is a man' is such a wild thing to say?  

It's circular logic. It doesn't tell you anything about what a man actually is. If we use just this definition the word man doesn't have any meaning anymore. It is true, gender is a social construct, but sex isn't. It makes sense to have a word for female adult human being and male adult human being and we have used the words woman and man that way for a long time. Why would we want to take the meaning away from these words? 

I think most radfems would want the guards of women's prisons to also be only female. Nevertheless they have understandible a bigger issue if a convicted rapist is sent to the women's prison, because that person decided, that they are now a woman. 

Men (I have no reason to believe this doesn't go for all biologically male people) are on average much more violent than women (biologically female people), so it makes sense, that some women (especially ones that have already experienced male violence) would want to stay away from us. I am not sure whether this is primarily rooted in culture or nature but it is still a fact. Of course women can also be abusive, but as I said it happens much less often. It is also feasible to have safe spaces for just women, it is not really feasible to have a space that is safe for women from women (except solitary confinement or something)."
1386,nini551,">because, believe it or not, a guy on reddit is not all-seeing.

Well, you're not a guy, you're a woman, so there's that.

You might find most people would be more understanding of your distress at the FACT you are female, which is so extensive you pretend to be a guy 24/7 to avoid thinking about it - if you just left it as that. ""Hey, this upsets me, please don't remind me of it."" 

But no, that's not enough for you. EVERYONE has to pretend to really believe your reality-avoidance coping mechanism as well. You go so far as to throw female prisoners, lesbians, and children under the bus to be sexually harassed, raped, and assaulted, all because you think that will help YOU. Male rapists of INFANTS, including men who have raped infants TO DEATH, have been transferred to women's prisons where they lurk around and leer at the mother and child program. You would remorselessly ENFORCE all the women and children to play along with a baby rapist's sick fantasies because you think then they will have to play along with your own. That's where you become a very, VERY shitty person."
1387,Tarsiustarsier,"She is still the CEO. 

I am glad your peergroup sounds reasonable, I am not yet sure how reflective that is of transgender people as a whole, but it is a good sign.

I can see why you would feel pressured to transition early by us, but we surely don't want you too. We would like women to pick up typical male interests and men to pick up typical female interests, because diluting gender stereotypes will in the end lead to a freer society for everyone, but if people transition because of these reasons this will reinforce gender stereotypes. 

Many of us also believe, that truly transitioning is impossible either way, since you can't change your biological sex and being a man or a woman is linked to biological sex. 

Now to explain, why many gendercritical feminists often have big problems with nonpassing transwomen in women's spaces:

We men are on average much more violent than women. Many gendercritical feminists have had very personal experiences with male violence and a person who looks just like a normal man will at worst trigger their ptsd and at best make them feel unsafe in a space they formerly thought was safe for them. As far as I can tell there is also not really a lot of reason to believe that transwomen are less violent than men."
1388,06549r,"If your views are skewed chances are any source telling you your views are skewed isn’t going to give you a new perspective, and that’s why I am here and not wasting my tine away in some trans sub. 

>Yeah but often in children GNC tendencies manifest in their looks, and especially their hair. The main way I actually tell the sex of a child though is based off of how they act.

You made a false claim. What we are discussing is if people “pass” or not, we all know that we aren’t talking about clothes and hair but anatomy. 

And the “opposite sex” claim is just weird. Women who do not follow the physical rules of how a woman “should look like” (stereotypically) don’t necessarily look like men, that’s a notoriously trans view. Just like how they lump GNC women and Butch together. It’s small minded at best. 

It boils down to you still believing there’s a right way of being a man or a woman.

>The main way I actually tell the sex of a child though is based off how they act

It’s possible to sense it from behavior, but still I find it odd that an adult (or even young adult) is not able to tell a child’s sex by just looking at them. And I mean actual physical features. 

I also find a bit problematic to judge sex solely based on behavior, not all children are socialized that way. There are still (rare) children who are born GNC in every way they can, they won’t be trying to emulate gendered behavior. 

>I think I’ve largely responded in my last point but to make it clear: no. I am legit GNC in the way I exist in the world, and I also was when I was a child. 

I find it hard to believe you’re GNC based on what you’re saying. Once again, non binary and GNC is not the same, just because you don’t see yourself following a gendered check list it does not mean you don’t believe it’s a thing or that sex and gender are different. 

GNC is the polar opposite of trans. It’s the rejection of gender as anything remotely significant in one’s life. 

I am GNC. It does not mean I look like a man, it does not mean my goal in life is to become some perfectly androgynous being. It just means I could care less about gender. I do believe it’s a healthier way of living and I hope you’ll eventually fully embrace it if that’s what you wish. 

>Genes can only do so much there are many more significant things that can have an effect on a person’s appearance.

I am going to try to elaborate why I find trans (and detrans) individuals to have a harder time telling apart people’s sex by just looking at them. 

Trans ideology is based on the idea that sex and gender is the same, what that means for sex is that gender (in this case) will dictate how male and female should look like. Now, we all know about basic biological facts of the attraction factor of hip width, or stronger jawline, broad shoulders, fuller breasts etc. those do have implications in our everyday life and can seem to be the “human ideal”. Socially it did become the human ideal in a way, even though there’s cultural variations.

But it has been proven that humans are not that simple. Women who are attracted to men even experience fluctuating changes on how they perceive men, ultimately if someone doesn’t look actual diseased or dying there’s no current right way of looking like a man or a woman. People have different tastes, that’s a given. And unless those are fetishes there’s nothing unhealthy or unusual about it. 

I have had a trans identified man (aka a “transwoman”) talk to me before about breasts implants as if it’s something I already have planned. It was really bizarre, there was a strong undertone that women should have “bigger breasts”. As someone who’s GNC that just seemed ridiculous to me, even though I am free to pick whatever I want to do (rather that happens to be a common gendered trait or not), I still know very well that my small breasts do not make me less of a woman. And this was one situation out of many. So trans identified individuals (and even detransitioned ones) still have a biased view of things. I am not saying it’s in purposed or maliciously, it’s just a natural path for anyone who ever even fell into that trap. 

>I’d argue that benefits to mental wellbeing can in very rare cases justify it for either a short time or while it’s closely monitored though. 

Absolutely not. Pumping a child (or anyone for the matter) in this case with hormones is NEVER the answer. There’s absolutely nothing you can say on this matter that will change any sane person’s mind. It’s vile.

>feel that way because I have found the mental benefits to work quite well for myself. 

You’re sick. And I don’t mean that in the “you sick bastard” way. I mean you’re still sick, detransitioning does not automatically mean your mind is health. That’s why you can’t see what’s happening in front of your own very eyes. 

>I still feel betrayed with the implication that somehow they would make me a woman, and I feel manipulated into doing things that I never would’ve done had I known I was merely having a delusion supported, 

And you should be. Yes you have been manipulated and exploited and I am sorry that happened to you, but you are still hanging onto it by a thread. Let it go and stop feeding into harmful ideologies. 

>Source?

Eyes, science, facts, doctors, what else do you want? You seriously think that giving estrogen to little boys is not going to make them look like little boys with something wrong with them health wise? The only way you’d maybe think they look healthy is if you think they’re girls, and even then it wouldn’t take much to see that those little “girls” have something off about them. 

They’re little boys. Once again I tell you (and it’s a fact) **we’e born* with our sexes. It’s not something that will suddenly happen at some point. The reason why any of you would have to have HRT forever is because your body is the sex you were born with, the reason why it fights back to it’s natural course it’s because that’s how it’s supposed to be. There’s no mystery here. 

Take it from the perspective of an outsider, transwomen look like men who seriously lacked testosterone. Same for transmen. I am bisexual, technically speaking I wouldn’t have much of a reason not to be attracted to trans identitief individuals right? Wrong. Being attracted to men *and* women does not mean I like anyone in between. And I do like “masculine” women just like I like “feminine” men, but it’s different. 

And I am not saying men with naturally “feminine” physique or women with naturally “masculine” physic look odd, they’re different from trans. One is natural and the other is a literal self induced destruction. An illness. A tempering with your own health. A naturally “feminine” looking man is healthy, that’s just he way the is. 

>Yeah I’m biased, 

Then I guess you have the answer for all of your questions right there. 

>But I’m not biased in the way you think. I’m biased in the way that men would be biased against a bill ordering them all to go off to a pointless traumatic war.

I am not judging you by your username. I am judging you by all the things you said. 

And please do not compare your situation with war (or the holocaust, or being black, or being gay, or being hispanic) etc etc. I see this so much, your situation is like have been lured into the trans cult, that’s exactly what it was. It’s bad enough by itself, you don’t have to prove to anyone here that it was very bad.

>Oh yeah I 100% have negative impressions of all those users based off their usernames, just like I have a negative impression of a person calling themselves methdealer69. 

Methdealer69 is funny. It’s obviously a joke, it’s very evident that it is. Your username is not a joke and that’s also evident. I feel that explaining this is a bit silly. 

>The thing is if they wanted to interact and argue with me I’d at least give them a chance to prove me wrong. 

But nobody is here to prove you or anyone anything. This is our space since we’re silenced everywhere else, that’s something else I see happening here, there’s often this idea that we’re here to debate everything we stand for, but we’re not. There’s time and place and specific matters to debate but everything else we already have a “side”, that’s why we’re here. 

>I’ve argued with actually trump supporters and while I may think they are horribly misguided, I will hear them out and try to supportively help them see the problems in their views. 

People only believe what they want to believe. They will only see things when they are ready to see things. 

>I’m not going to give up on people just because they are objectively bad at this point in time. If I can make them less bad, and show them that there is an actual problem with their thinking then I will. 

I do not think we should have a discussion anymore. The only thing I can say is that sex and gender is not the same, and truly understanding that is beneficial for everybody. 

My interest in this battle is that I am GNC and I am tired of seeing my gay brothers and sisters getting shit and children going back to getting chained down by stupid senseless gender roles. The HRT and SRS only make me even more passionate about fighting against it, and we clearly disagree on HRT. 

Again, best of luck."

So yeah having an alternative word to transition would be nice."
1394,TranssexualScum,"I 100% agree. I kinda hate being in the position where I know that transition can help so many yet I also have seen in so many cases how harmful it can be. If a person isn’t being helped along to cope with dysphoria while they’re transitioning then I think it is all too likely that the person will be harmed by transition. And I absolutely hate how heavily pushed this stuff is, I truly think transition should be a last resort. 

Also I think that very importantly we should be looking at detrans people and the experiences they go through. It is hugely important to make sure that all of us can make it through, and detrans people have such a strong experience both with transition and detransition. I think that building a model based off of detransitioners and all the ways that that can come to be a decision as well as people who have considered detransition but chosen to not do it would likely be the best way to start working out an actual treatment for both gender and sex dysphoria.

personally, i think rape should be an immediate death sentence, but you don't give a shit about that. none of you fuckers care about the actual thoughts and feelings of transgender people. you're disgusted by us, and wish we would just quietly stop existing and bothering you so much. you made up, completely made up, a scenario where i am gleefully throwing known rapists and pedophiles in with helpless women and children, what, to stop getting misgendered? how does that make sense?"
1397,somewhereinside,"The abolishment of gender stereotypes is a goal I also agree with, personally my wish to transition comes from bodily dysphoria, I don't feel as though I couldn't enjoy typically feminine interests before I started to transition.

I understand that women with PTSD aimed at men would also feel nervous around trans women two. I wish more trans women felt this way and didn't get offended if a cis woman didn't want to be around them as friends or romantic partners. Just like there are trans only safe spaces in the LGBT community, if there were cis-only spaces two it could help these people. 

The whole violence thing I can understand in a way from seeing how some trans people have acted: but violent individuals should be punished and protected from on a individual basis, like how not every man is suspected as about to be violent wherever they go. For society to function there has to be to an element of trust in people, if everyone was paranoid (different from taking safety precautions) of each other it would be hard to do anything.

Whilst I acknowledge it is impossible to change ones biological sex e.g I will always be male due to my XY chromosomes and their expression on my phenotype. I also believe gender transition and presenting as a woman in society is not depending on biological sex or gender stereotypes. Which is why I don't see trying to transition as a fruitless endeavor, the things I have already done have already alleviated my dysphoria: which is my ultimate goal."
1398,TranssexualScum,"If you don’t want to have a discussion anymore that’s okay. I’ll avoid responding to anything not directly related to my reasons for being here to try to at least shed some light on it.

Basically I do consider myself a man, and I do consider myself GC because I hate gender more than anything at all. One of the things I hate most about transitioning is the pressure to have to fulfill another set of gender roles that I want nothing to do with. I have crippling sex dysphoria though and have been finding it almost impossible to deal with internally. Other than that though I also need some space like this where I can express my views without being manipulated into thinking I should keep transitioning. I hate transitioning and know it doesn’t do what I want because it can never change my sex or “solve” my sex dysphoria and it just gives me gender dysphoria in a new way. The only reason why I left a response in the first place was to add nuance. It wasn’t to say that children should transition or anything. Like sure there are some children who already are so messed up and mentally ill that they can’t be helped by therapy alone, but transition won’t do it for them either, and even if it helps it’s very dangerous for non sex dysphoric people to end up caught up in that. So yeah, I just wanted to say I come to GCguys because I am a GC guy, and I need a place where I won’t be judged for expressing my gender critical views.

Thank you for wishing me luck. I can’t wait to actually be able to break free of this system."
1399,TranssexualScum,"The main point of that comparison was the forced and traumatic. Sex dysphoria can be traumatic, and without being offered any treatment it becomes forced. That treatment could be anything that works (including therapy). And the stupid idea that making a person think they’ve changed sex will solve sex dysphoria is horrible and harmful to everyone. That is where my biases are. I think the modern idea of transition is utter lunacy and assuming that it’ll work for everyone is the equivalent of signing such a bill. Then there’s the more nuanced approach that I take where a modified type of transition that doesn’t say anything about changing sex and only allows body dysmorphia from sex dysphoria to be lessened making it easier to mentally calm yourself and work through the sex dysphoria and understand that it’s okay to be the sex that you are. Anyway I obviously have biases but they aren’t in the way you may think. And that’s really what my point was there."
1400,TranssexualScum,I honestly don’t know where I was strawmanning there. And I am not being disingenuous. Pity me or don’t I honestly don’t care. I was just letting out my frustration.

Maybe check in ever now and then to see if the men here are actually getting it or if they are way off but seriously what can a man add to a discussion about women’s rights when he hasn’t experienced a second of being a woman. If you want to educate men then maybe that could be a reason to join but I imagine for women this sub would just seem like a bunch of men splaining to each other about what they think women need.

How much research has been  done into other treatments?  There was a time when people believed the ""best treatment"" for various mental illnesses was electroshock or exorcism. Very little is actually known about dysphoria or the brain or mind in general.

>. i cannot explain to you how offensive and disgusting the term 'colonizing women's identities' 

Well it is offensive  and disgusting to me and to many women that you are doing that shit by falsely claiming to be women when you are actually members of a privileged and oppressive class. I don't even care if you are mentally ill, it's still wrong to claim you are a woman unless you were born female.

>you picked the worst thing you could think of as a gotcha against the tranny

No darling, and cool it with the victim complex.

I picked the worst thing I could think of THAT HAS HAPPENED IN REAL LIFE to real women as a result of what you're trying to enforce, in an attempt to elicit some empathy in you for the extremely real horrors women have to cope with because of your ideology, which doesn't seem to have made a dent.

Because it doesn't matter what happens to women, does it? It's all about you, you, you, and you.

It's nice that you think child rape *should* be a death sentence, but in practice, IT'S USUALLY NOT. In practice, child rapists have to be put somewhere. So, where would you put the male ones that identify as women? Women's prison or not?

FYI, I don't think of you as a ""tranny"" since changing sex isn't possible, therefore ""transitioning"" isn't really possible. I think of you as a woman - a playacting one - whose playacting would probably be harmless if it stayed at that, but becomes EXTREMELY dangerous when forced onto everyone else. I wouldn't mind pretending you are a male in social situations if it made you happy, but now that you're trying to enforce it legally and so universally, it's VERY much a no-go."

Perhaps a holistic approach needs to be taken, so rather than depending on any one thing, there is a large number of factors at play. So it isn't presented with clothes or what you do with your face, but a complex interaction between many different things."
1411,TranssexualScum,"Okay I am sorry about the comparison. I didn’t realize, and I won’t do it again.

As for comparing it to something I’ve been through that probably would be a bad idea given the only thing I can think of that’s close to the same level. I’ll still make the comparison but you aren’t going to like it. The only thing that I’ve experienced that’s on a similar level is an abusive relationship (I was never severely assaulted but they did lash out at me whenever they got angry and would very often take out their anger with either physical violence or threats). They aren’t the same thing or anything near the same thing either. But they both caused me similar levels of mental anguish. Personally I’d say the abusive relationship is worse in general because it makes actually being given support and care so much harder, but without support they do both hurt so much. I’m going to stop this comparison now thinking about this stuff hurts. I’ve mostly been able to deal with dysphoria but I haven’t had time to deal with the abusive relationship yet so I’m sorry but I just need to stop. Please don’t reply I don’t want to think about this anymore."
1412,tinycommunist,toupee fallacy bro
1413,DistantGlimmer,They probably just see your name and the fact that you were making a very nuanced argument and think you are on the TRA's side.  but it's probalby true that GC groups could be more welcoming of people like you. Maybe if I didn't have the background with you I do in GCvsQT I would have been more judgemental of your comment here. I will try to avoid doing that in future as much as possible (it's hard though as there are honestly so few genuinely reasonable trans people among the ones I talk to. Congrats on being the exception.)
1414,Tarsiustarsier,"I think this is interesting because it touches on a fundamental disagreement between the transgender and the gendercritical movement. 

I think we may have similar goals for how people should be allowed to behave in relation to sex and gender (i.e. pretty much how they want to, as long as they don't infringe on the rights of others) but a very different opinion on the way to get there. 

Most radfems argue, that the categories male and female make sense because of physiological differences and things like sexual attraction. They therefore would like biological sex to be the only thing that makes someone a woman or man (following the dictionary definition) and everything else should just be personal identity and shouldn't be seen as related to being a man or woman at all.
  
While (correct me if I misunderstand something) you would like to expand the definition of woman and man to include everyone that wants to be either. 

Another difference might also be, what we think leads to gender dysphoria in the first place, but I guess I am going offtopic here."
1415,Ohhiohyo,I’m not shocked at all. Sending porn to harass someone is something that is 99% done by deprived and creepy men. That demographic is well represented among TIM’s.
1416,Randomosaur,"Sometimes I wonder whether or not it's safe for me to be involved in this argument, and whether I might be risking my life by speaking out. These TIMs seem very dangerous, violent and irrational, just like their supporters."
1417,Dr_Bottomwriggle,">You have no way of knowing which young women have dicks or not

Well no, it's the ones that are obviously men. Why do TIMs think people can't tell?"
1418,KendallMintcake,"This is rape culture - ""you WILL see girldick""  
And then virtue-signalling politicians and others wonder why women are concerned about letting biological males into their toilets, changing rooms, hospital wards, rape centres, refuges and prisons."
1419,AdamRGdotcom,"Wow. What a power hungry, mentally unstable little narcissist he is."
1420,griffxx,"So tired of  these Feminized White Males claiming that they have periods. 

If they don't want to be seen as being mentally ill and and delusional don't make this Transcrazy insane thing."
1421,ManyDifferentThings,jfc
1422,archpope,Their first reaction is to send porn and make threats? Doesn't seem very ladylike to me.
1423,lefromageetlesvers,"That's what we always feel when in arguments with men. That's why a woman is killed i an ""argument"" every eleven second. We need to watch each other back, and expose them pubicly- humiliation is our only weapon: they have strenghth, but we outnumber them, and shame is on their side."
1424,Silverwind_Nargacuga,So... men.
1425,martinvanquish,"I feel like some of these guys really see Audrey Hepburn staring back at them in the mirror lmao. If you've ever been on the ""transpassing"" tags on Tumblr/Twitter you'll know what I mean.

It's like when they think they pass because women don't do anything when they see them in the bathroom. Like what the hell do you expect her to do if she sees a ""non passing"" transwoman in the bathroom? Yell? Throw toilet paper? Run away screaming? Just because she doesn't have an aneurysm on the spot doesn't mean she didn't pause, say ""wtf"" in her head, turn around, and leave asap."
1426,gcthrowaway53,it's literally what men say to lesbians but add 'girl' to the front of 'dick'
1427,jetpatch,They ain't feminized
1428,ManyDifferentThings,*Pink
1429,TheFizzardofWas,And we can agree that neither should say it? Okay.
1430,griffxx,LOL.
1431,KendallMintcake,"A trans-identified male on Twitter is, of course, having a go at her, posting pre-transition photos in an attempt to make her out to be a liar."

1433,Kai_Decadence,"It's unfortunate but part of me doesn't really have sympathy when their rash decisions actually backfire and especially at a young age (article cited they were mostly 19-early 20s). I'd place the blame on the parents who let them essentially mess up their body at a young age when they couldn't think critically of just the reality these surgeries and hormones will have but then past 18, I can't help but feel it's on you. 

i do wish them well in their de-transitioning but seeing how people try to act like they don't exist, I think it won't really shed much light unless they really band together and make their presence and experiences known. YouTube is already a good source for this so there's a start."
1434,Tintinikongo,"There will be more detransitioners among  young women because more young men trans  out of lust for the female body, AGP, and more women trans as an escape. 

In time, women will mature and not need to hide behind the male mask.

Also, the very high numbers of young women (80% of transitioners in the young group, unprecedented numbers) bears every chararcteristic of the sociocultural epidemic that it is."
1435,throwaway275445,"I think it's because of the huge recent surge in girls transitioning, up 4000% in a few years, which is mostly sparked by social contagion."
1436,Feminist_Username,The stronger effects of testosterone are another reason why. The vaginal atrophy it causes can be excruciating and the inevitable hypertension is dangerous.
1437,antonivs,"I have sympathy because they were badly misled by the people and society around them. This is true even past 18. They're indoctrinated with rigid societal ideas about gender, and it's not easy to overcome that indoctrination."
1438,Kai_Decadence,"I understand but unfortunately for them, some changes just can't be undone and they'll have to live with it for the rest of their days. The best they can do is not be silent about this and warn others to not make a hasty decision because the side effects are very real and even sometimes permanent."
1439,throwaway275445,There's no need to be so pessimistic about it. Many people have some physical reminder of a mistake they made or accident they had when young.
1440,Kai_Decadence,"I I understand that but something like this...? It's a bit different, it's like the ultimate accident (when it happens to the dumb parents foolish enough to let their misguided child do things that will drastically change their body). It's like... There's no going back from that. 

It's not so much pessimism because I can sympathize with the far younger people who fall into this trap but it's just, what more can you do? If they actually had SRS, there's really no fix for that or a young woman with a drastically deep voice or even a de-trans-identified male who's genitals are damaged from the prolonged hormone usage. It's like what can you say at that point?"
1441,throwaway275445,Well I have a friend who broke his back at 17 from trying to climb onto a giant chair on top of a furniture store while drunk and I feel that's quite bad even compared to surgically transitioning.
1442,Kai_Decadence,That is quite bad.
