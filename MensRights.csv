At this point, with the number of participants and comments, removing it would also have a detrimental effect to that valuable discussion. As a result, I will be leaving this up.

Those who continue to report it won't be satisfied with the response."

4,im_a_little_tea_pot,"I don't actually agree with what OP says in his argument. However, it is a valid argument and I don't see why he should be banned for it. So I tried to post a PNG of this, with the title ""Is it right to ban people we don't agree with"". Guess what? I got banned."
5,ScotWithOne_t,"Isn't intimidation and coercion illegal?  By doing either, you're not physically hurting someone, just making them *feel* unsafe enough to do your bidding.  

So, depending on how you look at it, they may have a point.  But shutting down the discussion and banning someone making an opposing point is retarded.  "
6,CristabelYYC,"I have been a feminist since age 9. I was banned for suggesting an abused woman should have left a man who, among other things, got a neck tattoo of her name two months after they met.  She ignored red flags, I muttered something about taking responsibility and...banned."
7,guy_from_sweden,"Almost all subreddits strive to become echo chambers, while simultaneously condemning them. To be honest, that also includes this one. What seems like a reasonable, justified ban in one subreddit is often easily spun to look very much the opposite in another one.

In this case, OP went into /r/feminism and spoke out against the notion that women have a right to *feel* safe. To us it looks a lot like OP was banned for saying something that makes perfect sense - you can't just claim that you are supposed to feel safe without a reasonable basis behind it. To them, it probably looks a lot like OP is promoting behaviour that is technically legal but considered sexist. Think stuff like cat calling. If you're a woman walking out during the evening and you pass by a group of men that cat call you - you're going to feel very unsafe although statistically the chances of them doing anything illegal in this situation is very low. That's the type of ""feel safe"" that /r/feminism consider obvious and that it looked to them as if OP was arguing against, even though I bet most of us in here would agree that no woman should feel unsafe while out and about on her own because other people act like pigs around her.

EDIT: Lots of good responses coming in. Allow me to clarify a few things.

Cat calling as a behaviour should not be outlawed. I believe however that we men have a greater responsibility to speak up against it. Likewise, women cat calling should also be spoken up against. The behaviour isn't harmful per se but it really doesn't fit in a modern society in my opinion. If somebody wants to do it, that is fine I guess? But right now a lot of people seem to be convinced the behaviour is okay.

No, OP should not have been banned. That was sort of the point with this comment. I think both OP and the /r/feminism user had valid thoughts on the matter but due to OP being banned it seems that he had no option to clarify that and make them understand.

And no, I don't actually think this subreddit is ban happy in particular. When I type ""strive to become"" the word 'subconsciously' fits in there too. What I mean is that hivemind thinking is commonplace here as with most other subs and this caused us to view stuff one sided, as I believe this post to be an example of."
8,Sushiandcat,"Female 50 here, I tend to agree that ensuring people are safe is more important than trying to make them feel safe.  I think being safe is a generic male and female, adult and child, issue but what makes someone feel safe is an individual issue.  I don't think we can guarantee anyone's safety but we should strive to create a society where everyone is valued and in that valuation people are made safe because if you value something you tend to protect it and keep it safe.  I think it was inappropriate to ban you for raising a point of view which was not particularly offensive, derogatory or anti women."

12,,"Yeah, I got banned for something similar. Was having an argument with someone about crime against women (I think?) and how there's never been a safer time for women (or the rest of us) in western civilization. I quoted a few sources proving my point and asked if they truly believe that civilization 20, 50, 100, 250, or 500 years ago was safer?

18,JimmyLongnWider,"Was banned myself. Go figure. 

As a male, you can participate in only three ways within r/Feminism:

1. You can say nothing. This means you are part of the problem you misogynistic piece of shit. 

2. You can agree that women have legitimate issues and point out how men face the same issues sometimes, and other issues other times. Men face issues? I don't think so, you misogynistic piece of shit. 

3. You can grovel and apologize for your very existence and agree wholeheartedly with every single thing your feminist masters say. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. You're still a misogynistic piece of shit, but we'll let you stay and carry heavy things for us. "

22,silverscrub,This can be both correct and incorrect entirely depending on context. If you work at a gas station and someone robs you with an unloaded gun you will be safe. You will definitely not feel safe though. If a woman is afraid she will get raped by ever man she meets she probably needs therapy more than anything.

25,ThirdProcess,"Definitely not on either side here. And also have no cobext. But if your feelings of safety were irrelevant we would have intimidation laws. ""But Officer there were no bullets in the gun, he was never in any real danger."" You can completely ruin a person's life by keeping them in a state of fear. Hence anti-stalking laws. Even certain types of torture like fake executions are on the no no list. A feeling is very relavent. Consider the issue of Police Officers using lethal force, they have to *feel* threatened.       
So feelings are important.  It just raises a more complex question of ""was your feeling reasonable?"". If there isn't some guideline and restraint we'd all be at the mercy of over reactors. (Not real) example: 12 year comes at cop with a whiffle bat. If the cop is not very brave can they claim the felt threatened enough to use lethal force? Let's hope not.      
Ignoring feelings is just wanting things to simpler then they are. Things should be as simple as possible, but no simpler."

27,ECU_BSN,"Oh! 

Can I also be banned from r/Feminism !!!

Please????"
28,definitelyjoking,"You're wrong though. People have a right to feel safe from imminent harm. It's why assault is a separate crime and tort from battery. The limitation is that the apprehension of imminent harm has to be objectively reasonable, so unreasonable feelings of imminent harm aren't protected. We absolutely say that you have a right not to fear imminent harm though, and assault is a pretty ancient cause of action."
29,fluffstravels,This is my first time posting in this sub but honestly this is pretty stupid. Society actually does make an effort to make people feel safe and it's fine they do. There's a point where it can get in the way of free speech and that I disagree with.

You would have probably defended the UMN football players."
33,,Lol what? You both are really dumb. Why not have people feel safe through sensible goals and legislation if necessary? This war on feminism has become a pissing contest with both sides yelling at one another too loudly to listen and make progress. Some of y'all are worse than the SJW you bitch about. Extremism is never good. 
34,goatmebro,"Wow. Feminists really piss me off. You make such a solid point that feminists should be like; hey that's a fucking valid idea. We should start focusing on behaviors of others not our own feelings. 

As a women I am well aware that I will not feel safe walking down a dark alley at midnight. I will not feel safe if I am drunk and surrounded by strangers. I will not feel safe if I'm having an anxiety attack. But, as a logical human being I know these are all either situations I put myself in or are psychological in nature and have absolutely nothing to do with the actions of men. 

Now if a man(or woman) came up to me and tried to put their hand down my shirt, I'd be not only afraid but fucking livid. That's an actions that's possible to police and should not be acceptable. It is not the same as a feeling. "
35,stidf,I actually disagree with you a on the feeling of security. Without that feeling of security the social compact of society begins to fray. It also strokes people's flight or fight instincts which depending on the location and surroundings can cause direct bodily harm to others. People being crushed by stampedes of people or riots don't happen if people feel secure in their persons while in public. I would argue that it is next to impossible to pursue happiness effectively without the feeling of security.

39,Drag0nV3n0m231,"You do have the right to feel safe. To feel safe to a reasonable extent is the same as actually being safe and having your rights be upheld. If my rights as a citizen and human being can be disregarded in a court of law, or infringed upon without punishment, it is reasonable for me to feel unsafe. Nobody said anything to conclude that their idea of being safe is unreasonable, you are just assuming that. You could be entirely correct that their idea of safe is unreasonable. But either way, you essentially saying that the general feeling is citizens should be ignored is just a rather childish way of viewing things."
40,Atheists4Trump,"Guys, come one with this shit.  You can legally defend yourself using lethal force because of feelings.  You guys don't have the logical high ground here because the law is not on your side.   I certainly have the right to feel safe, and if you threaten that I have the legal grounds to defend my safety.   And to an extent you have that protected by the 2nd and 4th amendment, castle laws and stand your ground laws.  If i see a person pointing a gun at my head I don't need to wait for anything more than my feelings of potential harm before defending myself.  


I think Mensrights needs a overhaul.  Getting banned by a sub with bad rules should not get you to all, its ignorant.  We have actual issues.  One of the biggest I see coming is only women will get maternity leave.   We know two parent households are better.  yet we actively encourage their destruction and the marginalization of our rights.  

But why care about actual mensright issues when you guys trolled a feminist.

41,The_Sad_Deku,I was banned years ago for explaining in the most polite way I could that the wage gap is a lifetime earnings gap and how they are not the same.
42,NVRLand,"This is like the most typical attitude ever in the /r/mensrights community. You get stuck on a semantic issue, ""win"" the discussion and see it as you have won over feminism. It's sad that this small semantic victory is treated like this huge triumph. 

Why is it so important for /r/mensrights to not be about men's rights? "
43,Thomasedv,"I do kinda disagree with you(both? Not sure what safe in that context means).  I think you should seek for physically and mentally healthy people in a society. That involves feeling safe from verbal threats, and potentially material damage. Sure you might not be hurt, but even the treath of physical damage, not directly said, but a self thought out consequence of something, can be unhealthy. 

That's not to say the ban was fair, but you very directly said their opinion was wrong, and that does very easily trigger those kinds of people, if that makes sense. A polite, ""I disagree"", might have been less likely to cause such an reaction. I think a lot of peole, with less mod power, also react badly when you outright state opinion as fact, but can only downvote, outside of banning. Those mods just don't have the objectivity to be a in proper control. (As in, they ban people that may only sound slightly rude, and not really breaking rules.)"

Saying someone man or woman who was abused should take responsibility for not seeing certain things is a bit of an dick thing to say. Not noticing something or not understanding why something is not right does not mean that person should be blamed when something horrible happens to them because of it.

There are very few bannings on this subreddit and those that happen tend to be directed not towards critics or those with opposing views, but those who seek to use the sub as a platform for either advertizement (old school manhood101 spam)  or seeking to bring irrelevent topics up over and over after many warnings (we had a ron paul poster who would spam political ron paul talking points weaved very slightly into MR issues, think 99% ron paul, 1% maybe MR). and the only censorship that happens is when it could get the sub itself banned.  

Just because feminists choose not to participate on this sub - in general - does not mean they aren't allowed to, as a matter of fact they are welcomed to.

Maximum disruption without having to defeat any security. 

I actually take comfort in this when I fly. I really, honestly don't believe that the terror threat is all that common/real. Because literally anyone could carry out that attack and yet *it never fucking happens*. So if these soft targets exist throughout the country and no one ever hits them, my conclusion is at least one of two things: 1) the NSA and CIA are fucking amazing and catch these guys wayyyyy before they even get to the airport and then never take credit so they can keep catching the next guy. And 2) the TSA is a mother fucking joke. A really expensive, civil liberty-eroding joke.

Your distinction between literal safety and feelings of safety as the goal of society breaks down a bit when taken into a larger picture. I would argue that the general goal is to ensure the well-being of citizens, and that is inextricably tied to mental well-being.

For example, if a kid is a victim of cyber-bullying or (non-physical) bullying from his peers, he is still at risk of suicide or other mental health issues. You may think this is his problem to deal with and he should ""jerk off, eat an ice cream cone, and play with his dog,"" but statistically you will get fewer deaths if you institute anti-bullying measures. Essentially, you are making them **be** safer by making them **feel** safer.

This connection may become less clear with other societal issues, but the concept that physical well-being and mental well-being are related is absolutely necessary to consider when discussing how things make people feel. The answer isn't necessarily to pander to irrational feelings, but the feelings should still be considered. 

And, to your point about considering feelings being Orwellian shit, I would argue that government intervention (laws) necessarily inspire feelings as a response regardless of whether they are taken into consideration. If your goal is to ensure that your policies are effective and lead to the best outcome for people, you should absolutely consider how people will feel about your actions before implementing them."

Poll /r/feminism and ask them if they feel ""unsafe"" when someone reveals they're an MRA during a discussion. You'll find the results enlightening.

And in fact, that would make it illegal.

Now, same situation, but this time before hand, we agree that the gun is fake, and we are just roll playing. Now when I do/say the same things as before, this time you **feel safe** because you know I'm not threatening your physical well being.

We don't and never will have enough information at our disposal to be 100% confident in our security. However, based on the information we do have, we can make educated guesses as to how safe we are. We do this as a society, and we do this as individuals. When we, as individuals, surmise that we are, in fact, safe, we *feel* safe. 

So being safe and feeling safe, while distinct, are still quite related. As such, people do have a right to feel safe—*reasonably* safe. Sometimes people have irrational fears. It happens.

Some problems can't be solved ""as a society,"" though, because that's simply not how some people think. We tell our conservative grandparents about ""all lives matter"" and they might think ""yeah! Except the blacks!""

It's very relevant to the feminism movement. I live in the middle of San Francisco -- the one place in the states most known for its cushy, SJW tendencies -- and I'm still blown away by how many men think (this is a real quote) ""it's wrong"" for women to be making more than men, and how they wouldn't stay in a relationship where that was happening.

We can't tell these people ""everyone should make the same money!"" To people like you and I, who already agree, of course. It makes sense. Nothing more needs to be said.

But any law that addresses bullying should/would try to stop the perpetrator (maybe with punishments or sensitivity training) and maybe give counseling to the victim, if the bullying was severe (as that can totally be necessary).    
By handling the actual issue it would hopefully also make you feel safer (because the actual crime is actionable, which is difficult currently), but the law itself does not contain any reference to feelings, only actual events/actions.

The difference between the mental health of people and their feelings is also important. Being bullied and put down by others, making you feel depressed I would see as a mental health problem. Feeling unsafe because you could be bullied (but aren't) because the laws are lax: not so much."
332,outcastded,"The point is just that if you are reasonably safe, then you should feel reasonably safe. That's the assumption that law makers should calculate with.

What about those who don't feel reasonably safe as long as there are still Muslims in the world, or men in the world, or whatever?

I'm not trying to make a point here, rather I'm raising a question. Will humans ever truly feel safe? As long as there is murder and rape in the world, people will not feel safe. Is there a future in which humans never commit such crimes while also not being effectively lobotomized? Part of being human is making mistakes (and facing the consequences of those mistakes - like societal condemnation/punishment). How far do we legislate against the ability(/right?) of humans to make mistakes in our pursuit of safety?

Also, scarcity means competition. Competition means people will frequently find it in their self-interest to act against the interest of others in making small micro-decisions in their lives.

About the whole feminism objectively protecting women from men, I disagree. I think it DOES downplay men's rights though which is why I don't identify as a feminist. I mean, it's a bit of a double standard because feminists are barking the same thing -- they think advocating for men's rights makes men full-blown sexists, which is NOT true. I respect your opinion though, but not everything is black and white - not everything is one side or the other. I think both men and women should have rights. Men need more of a voice though because their issues do tend to get pushed to the side."

R/Feminism is not a place for facts and stats. It's a support group for those to vent about their feelings. I had to stop going to r/relationships because instead of pointing out the obvious in the posts, people really just wanted to have others share in their pain or relate to what they are going through. It's like, Woman A says something bad about Guy B, and even though we are only looking at a snapshot of time, not the entire relationship, and we are also only looking at one side of the story, the reality is you should always side with the OP on r/Relationships. Why? It's not about finding out the TRUTH of what is happening, it's about OFFERING SUPPORT to the person with the issue. Those are two VERY DIFFERENT things, and I would bet r/feminism is exactly the same. You are there to offer support, NOT find the truth. I think this is important for many of us, women or men, that we get some form of support for what we are going through.

Humans fluctuate between feeling certain emotions every so often,  unbeknownst to us when they will change, it's one of our basic functions. The government would never be able to guarantee or provide for us with a certain emotion we want to feel or not feel. If we want to achieve that goal, of everyone feeling as safe and equal as anyone else, we would have to rid of our own emotions.

The ""goal"" of striving for a society where people feel safe isn't clearly attainable or an objective endeavor but that doesn't mean we shouldn't strive for it. And it definitely doesn't mean that we don't make efforts to attain happiness.  

I would argue that one of the most fundamental desires of a human is the desire to feel safe. If we take that as true, then we can extend it to the way we want our societies to function. We want them to function in such a way that supports the fundamental desires of humans, while not infringing on other humans. One of those desires is to feel safe so we implement laws to protect our safety. It's hard to divorce the *feeling* of safety from *actual* safety.  

But that might be different than what we're discussing here. What we're discussing is more along the lines of: should people claiming that they feel unsafe about something always be regarded as something important to recognize as a legitimate societal issue? I think the answer is clearly no. If I feel unsafe about ham sandwiches they should not be banned. If some feel unsafe about clowns, clowns should not be banned. If many feel unsafe about rapists, then they should be banned. Where do we draw the line? It should be drawn, but where?  

My point is that it's unfair for someone to say, ""We should strive for the feeling of safety"" then get the response, ""How will we know that we have achieved the goal of feeling safe?""  

We strive for things all the time where there's no clear goals. Like being successful."

432,mrmensplights,"You act like Feminism and MRAs are two sides of the same coin, and in some ways I agree.  But any detailed analysis reveals they are very different animals.

First, I have a bone to pick with your definition of feminism. Let's look at the first three real world definitions of Feminism from recognised dictionaries:

* ""organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests""

* ""the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.""

* ""the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men.""

These definitions speak to something more than simply ""gender equality"". Implicit in them is also the idea that women are worse off than men and that we need to focus on giving women more power in order to achieve gender equality. In actual fact Feminism goes far beyond the basic definitions and encapsulates an entire political ideology where women are an oppressed. This ideology instills in it's adherents a world view from which to filter everything they experience and their communities are constantly reinforcing what to believe.

MRAs don't really play this kind of ideology game. They come as conservatives, liberals, socialist minded, and individualists. MRAs are not one collective but rather a collection of small special interest groups with overlapping concerns. some groups focus on custody rights, some on inequality in the justice system, others on intactivism, or the educational system.

Actually, mens issues do have a place under the umbrella of feminism called mens lib. It doesn't seem too interested in the real world issues MRAs concern themselves with (like divorce,justice system,education system, etc) but instead focuses mostly on how traditional masculinity harms men ie ""Toxic Masculinity"".  It refers to specific behavioural norms imposed on men by the patriarchy. It doesn't just admit men can be trapped or damaged by the by these norms but goes one step further and demonises the norms and thus has the effect of attempting to impose a different set of norms. So in actuality,the result is an attempt to control mens behaviour more than anything.

Unfortunately, the core principals of feminism will forever place it at odds with men and the mens rights movement.

Even when you reach an understanding, it's not as if the entire world will be appreciative of it, which may lead to you feeling unsafe when you leave the safe space you've become part of.

Even gender egalitarianism is in opposition to feminism, since not only can feminism not reach it's supposed goal of equality, it's actually an active detriment to that goal, as an ideology, so anyone wanting equality must by definition be fighting the main source of gendered inequality: Feminism.

Turns out you can't reach a point of gender equality utilising an ideology that blames all evils in the world on a secretive global one world government, made up of every man, ever & so every man ever needs to be punished for belonging to this evil empire.

I know, it's shocking that such an ideology could never lead to any kind of gender equality, but it's true."

Everywhere and everyone has it bad or good in one way or another, that means women just as much as men, blacks just as much as white. There is a victim culture in North America, but that shouldn't distract us from actual victims. "

Also LOL at the person using Tourette's and epilepsy as a shield. ""You're literally making fun of a disabled person..."" just more identity politics bullshit. There's no way to 100% know this person is epileptic or has Tourette's syndrome. The only thing I have a problem with is the person saying ""I've never seen a well-mannered man on a plane"".

I hate the term mansplaining but it usually crops up when a woman thinks there is some implied dismissive attitude or tone, or they feel they are not being according the respect they feel they deserve when being addressed. They may further  presume this is connected to some  sexism on your part.

 Coming off as  smarter than them could be threatening and interpreted as a slight. This is a tricky one for any employee manager interaction. 

This could be utter projection on their part, but it is worthwhile to identify what they are reacting to. If they can't or won't identify the issue then it is likely rooted in some insecurities of their own which will remain a minefield if you  don't know what these insecurities are.


I must admit I have struggled at times with this. The reason is because I like to be right. Dialogue can be a game and has an implied competiton. If I see weakness or ambiguity in someone's point of view, I am prone to point it out is some way.
To me, this is the point of the discussion of basic facts or strategies - to arrive at the most sound formulation of an idea. What can be wrong with that - right? I didn't take it personally if people challenge me on this basis because that is what I expect in this type of exchange. This is the outcome of too much university interaction  I think. 

But plenty of people do not share this  approach. They see it as needlessly adversarial. I can  be at cross purposes with someone else if I don't recognize we are not on the same page.  I have learned that a little humour and self deprecation can go a long ways in the work place with people and to not always press my advantage simply because I can because some people are far more sensitive than I am."

The poster calls him a ""manspreader in recovery,"" meaning that he's binding himself to stop himself from rudely spreading his legs. Manspreading is a term referring to the way that many men generally spread their legs when seated, whereas this is less common for women due to skirts etc. The term is often used in a sexist manner to show that men are rude or selfish.  
  
The responder says that they've ""never seen a well-mannered man on a plane, enjoy!"" meaning that they approve of the man's restraints (which they assume is for manspreading) and they're telling the poster to enjoy the rare opportunity to sit near a well-mannered man.  
  
The final responder calls them out, pointing out that the man in question is likely has a disability and that his restraints are not because he's afraid of being a manspreader.  
  
Nobody said that there's anything wrong with binding to prevent leg spreading, it's just almost certainly not the case here. It's such a trivial issue that almost nobody would bring along bindings for it."

I think the whole ""man spreading"" thing says a lot about modern feminism: women now have it so good in our society one of the central issues facing women is men spreading their legs too wide, because anatomy.

This is just my experience, and is totally independent of gender or the experiences of others. But when I was a lead and an operations manager I'd usually spend a fair amount HR people. Again, totally independent of gender ~ they were the most unprofessional, petty, gossipy people in the whole joint. Because what is someone going to do, report them to HR?

Someone would pretty much have to threaten my life before I went to HR. They're just as likely to hurt you as help you and it's in your best interest to go unnoticed. "
805,elebrin,"If you do complain though you've gotten your last promotion with that company. Honestly, if you work for a company where that sort of response is the norm, maybe it's best to start looking for new work.

Not to mention you can ask them to remain anonymous and which point whoever was beint sexist still gets a complaint against their name and spoken to. HR are there to protect the company and these sort of issues are taken seriously as it puts the company at risk.

And let's not even dip our toes into what happens at a company that uses unions, because that's a whole new headache. 

There's a reason why most HR departments won't hire someone for their department without a Bachelor's degree in Human Resources. It's because there's a lot of shit they need to understand.

If you don't know what it means, then you're just jumping into a fad of using stupid words for stupid reasons. Either way, I would not want anything to do with a person who uses said word.

None of the options are comfortable and right now the answer is to just deal with it if I'm flying domestically. It sucks.

Most of the trips I take I end up taking an economy airline vs some of the better ones. Let's look at my trip in February, flight is $300 round trip. The next option up for an airline that lets you pick your seats was like $400. Picking an emergency exit is like another $100.

Everyone else in the office greets me and me them whenever we walk by or are in the kitchen but I dont even get a smile from any of them let alone a ""Hi"".

864,PaulNuttalOfTheUKIP,"Because they're too young to get a job and haven't actually interacted with an HR department. Reddit has the whole echo chamber thing going on, and it's obvious everywhere. Look at their opinion on the IRS, these kids have never paid taxes but are convinced that you don't fuck with the IRS because other Reddit users have talked about it (and linked to the Joker saying he won't mess with the IRS). Plenty of people screw the government out of taxes. They talk about fire marshalls like they're Nazis but the defend their adherence to fire code. Again, they only do that based on anecdotes they've encountered on Reddit. My favourite example of this behaviour is from r/AskReddit: a question was asked along the lines of ""what products are the same whether they're store brand or name brand"", and a top comment was tampons. A few hours later a thread was made asking ""what should you buy at the dollar store to save money"". Would you have guessed it, a top comment was about tampons. Everyone does this, not just Reddit users; I have a couple friends that only watch the news when they come over or when I link them to things and within the next 48 hours I'll hear them talk with authority over the very limited information provided by these articles. I'm often here, unsure about literally everything except how to rek scrubs on CSGO, and these jackasses spout of like the most secure, knowledgeable information curator around.

980,MindBody360,"Just a comment re: the glass bottom. I believe that the rules differ from state to state. Here in Cali, Los Angeles specifically, there is a huge homeless population. A homeless child  (excuse the expression) trumps an adult, always. A woman with a child trumps men. However, there are a cornucopia of shelters in L.A. that co-exist; men's only, women and children only, women no children, etc. There are more men that are homeless. There are more women that remain with their children even after collapsing into homelessness. There are more male veterans, but more women get raped on the street. Some shelters have rules about capacity as mandated by the Fire Marshal, so if the rule is get to intake by 8:00 A.M., it's a hard number, not a suggestion. And lastly, in terms of getting help, there are programs for people of all kinds that assist individuals and families getting back on their feet. It generally would provide vouchers for immediate housing, but even if that runs out, a Case Manager or Social Worker can help get SSI, SSDI, GR, job training, clothes and medication with absolutely no discrimination. Homelessness is a huge problem for human beings, so one quarter of beds going to women is not inappropriate, to me.

Well first off the kid thing you probably don't even have to mention, all of our social systems elevate the welfare of children. But secondly the problem is homelessness in general anyways, I wouldn't try to pit men and women against each other when they're both being fucked over by the same thing. While there are legitimate, theory-backed reasons these sorts of divisions are made, would leaving half the women on the street or exposing them to danger in co-ed buildings really do a whole fucking lot to further the justice of the whole situation?

What past societies figured out - and which we will eventually once the costs of feminist idiocy grow high enough to collapse the largesse necessary to spawn it - is that part and parcel of men's disposability is men's greater utility as well. Men make most of everything, repair most of everything, and defend most of everything. 

Men used to receive a concomitant amount of respect and legal authority due because of their greater responsibility, again in societies that worked with nature and not against it. 

Feminism and the larger equality cult has destroyed that, and will continue to do so until it starves itself out, is replaced by a culture that does not operate on such false precepts, or a combination of the two. "

The other article, which the one pictured here seems to be quote, since it put their words in quote, does say that '23% of homeless are women' (not 1/4), but it is listing marginalized groups and puts aboriginals and veterans ahead of women, even though they are a lower percentage.

Nope. Not even close. The amount of paperwork required to get food stamps rivals that required to apply for a small business loan.  

I've witnessed the utter absence of help for homeless people just by watching the plight of people I know.  The harder they work to get out of it, the more resistance they encounter.

Food stamps are just the warm-up.  God help you if you try to get an apartment with fewer than fifty benjamins in your fist.  After that beats your ass for a year, try to get a job or a phone without an address.  

The only reason homelessness is a problem is because one thing the entire world can agree on is that obstructing the homeless should be a team effort.   If you believe otherwise, you have no fucking clue how wrong you are.   

P.S. There is a higher chance than you think the person next to you at work lives in their car.   If the rest of the world has its way, that's where they will remain.

1087,peanutbutterjams,">Aboriginals (38 per cent), people who identify as LGBTQ2+ (13 per cent) and veterans (11 per cent) are over-represented in the homeless population. Women make up 23 per cent of the homeless population.

...which means they're under-represented in the homeless population, while men are over-represented. 

I sincerely appreciate your ""What if's"", your attempt to cull yourself from any potential groupthink, but the article was generally about homelessness, it quoted several statistics about the make-up of homelessness, but it avoided saying that 3/4's of the homeless are men.

Beyond this, the perceived lack of recognition of the ways in which modern society harms men is a sore-spot in *any* men's rights movement. For such people, I can see how galling it would be for the over-representation of men amongst the homeless to be presented as a hardship for women. 

The article is trying to drum up some support and empathy - always a worthy and thankless task. They do that by talking about the kinds of people that evoke sympathy from the general public. White men are *not* on that list. Women are.

So: they've taken a stat that shows the over-representation of men in the homeless community and inverted it to be about women because they want people to care about the homeless and people care more about women than men. (Who wouldn't. They're wonderful.)

Regardless of your politics, there's information here. The inversion is information (upon which I've posted a *possible* interpretation). The relative value of men is information. The tack of your response, and mine, is information. This is how we speak to ourselves, and while the individual voice is priceless, we also need to listen to the subtext of social conversation.

Accepting and using only those pieces of information which support our current world view is tribalistic and inherently corrosive to a modern society. It's inhumane to simplify all of humanity in order to satiate the demands of our ego, picking out the facts that we don't like until all we have left is a very precarious Jenga tower.

Yes it is very scary to think a woman is out there with no protection and no shelter... but so are homeless men. The kinds of people who would attack a homeless woman are very likely to also attack a homeless man. Women do have the added threat of rape, which can lead to unwanted pregnancy. However, there are most certainly homeless men becoming victims of sexual abuse as well.

I know a lot of people are trying to spin it that the graphic insinuates men don't matter, which is incorrect. But the above could be a valid concern that routinely gets overlooked in comparison."

But here's the article. http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/05/31/vancouver-homelessness-at-record-levels-2016-count.html

All in all it's a fine article except for this line 

>> Women make up 23 per cent of the homeless population.

Assuming the paper is operating off of a gender binary perspective the statistic DOES appear to be somewhat out of place (unlike the other statistics). Things like ""39% aboriginals"" seems ok to report if this is disproportionate to Aboriginal populations as a whole. 

On the other hand - I assume that Vancouver doesn't have fewer than 23% female population, which would be not only an unremarkable statistic for reporting on ""record levels of homelessness"" as it represents a statistical advantage for women but it blatantly ignores that men are actually an afflicted category in this context. But I think because being ""male"" is sort of like the same thing as being ""normal"", it doesn't sound as good to an editor. 

Also we should consider that male chauvinism might be coming into play here. That might be a controversial thing to bring up in this circle jerk but ultimately I think the intention of this like was to say ""Homelessness is a travesty but a WOMAN being homeless is especially egregious"". Ala. women are delicate and need to be protected. By allowing women to be homeless we males in power are failing to protect them. 

So all around just kind of a stupid line in that article. Not any big deal though.

half of the respondents (55.9%) had been
raped, almost three-quarters (72.2%) had
been physically assaulted, and one-quarter

rates of victimization were much higher than

See, the Army, they consider **any** psychiatric disorder, even a ""harmless"" one like an attention span of a butterfly, to be equivalent to full on hallucinatory schizophrenia, so the way the regulations are set up, if you're under active treatment for any mental disorder your ass is out on medical discharge.  

So I had to deal with that.  Which was fun.

But once I got out I started medication (Strattera/atomoxetine) for my ADHD and my life turned around in a fucking hurry.  Got employed.  Got a girlfriend.  

For years before the Army I had stubbornly tried to just ""beat"" ADHD, like cancer or something, and persevere over it through sheer will, but what I was really doing was hopping around on one leg instead of getting a wheelchair or one of those sweet prosthetic legs.

ADHD is never going to not be a part of my life, because it's in the way my brain itself is structured.  Something in there is broken, and we don't know how to fix it, but we can at least help it with the right chemicals at the right dosage.  And with that medicine my life is finally back on track.  I'm finishing up my Bachelor over the next couple of years, and after that I have a few leads on getting my foot in the door with my preferred career field (digital forensics).

Literally, I went from not being able to remember what I was told to the point that I had to carry a notepad and pen around with me in the Army to substitute for an almost complete lack of short-term memory, to working towards a career where detail orientation and accuracy are paramount (because if I fuck up a report that is later used as evidence in court the wrong guy could go to jail or walk free).

That's how much of a difference it makes.  

I'm doing a lot better now, but it took several very lucky dice-rolls to get here.  I could've been mugged or killed while homeless.  I could've died in Iraq.  These aren't things that had a small chance of happening, they were substantial risks.

It is rare that Domestic Violence Shelters accept men. In my case, the shelter put me in a hotel under an anonymous identity until the shelter ran out funding (I'm living with PTSD and can't work because of it). The shelter simply does not have money to assist men, and the entire budget they had for men for the year was used putting me in the cheapest/skeeziest motel where my Xbox One was stolen, never to be returned.

They ran out of funds before I got housing assistance, and for about a week I slept in my car (with my Service Dog in the middle of winter) in the back of the Domestic Violence Shelter (they said it would be safer there than some random parking lot due to local police response to the shelter and they had cameras and always someone on staff at the shelter 24x7).

The night person on duty there let me come in after curfew one night to stay in the living room. Broke the rules, but I was very appreciative of it, and I had been at the shelter long enough during the days that I got to know most of the women and kids there. The kids liked seeing my dog too. They knew enough about my situation too, so they felt probably more comfortable around me.

But anyway. One of the victims had a story done on her by one of the local news stations because of how severe it was and whatnot, but the shelter manager who really helped me a lot made it a point to talk to the reporter about my case (keeping things confidential, obviously), and she wanted to make it a point to convey that it is a lot harder for men for so many reasons, and there aren't as many resources available for men, etc., and she ended up mentioning that in the news piece (highlighting male victims, not just women).

It was really tough for me, still is for a lot of reasons, dealing with PTSD and other issues, but I know the shelter I went to really helped me out as much as they could, but it's a cold hard fact there just simply is not same support for men as there is for women. I mean, I had help and I spent a week sleeping in my car with my Service Dog in the middle of winter and had my Xbox One stolen that was my primary coping method for PTSD. There are plenty more men out there that need help, and it is something people should keep in mind, DV shelters get A LOT of support from local businesses (Target donates clothing, Starbucks donates expired (but still good) food), but shelters typically have a separate budget to assist men (e.g. putting them in a cheap hotel since they can't stay in shelter), it's usually a small budget, and can be used up quickly.

I think I've posted this before, but there was a victim in Canada, and he got his life turned around and ended up starting the only shelter in Canada for male victims.

Well this was a shelter for women, and since I was 13 at this time and they almost didn't let us stay there.

Basically I was a threat because I was a 13 year-old boy. Fun times. My mom told me later that if I had been any older they wouldn't have let us stay."

First, all of our libraries offer internet access but we also have a crap-ton of open wifi access points all over town. On top of that, you can get a cheap android phone for $25 and just connect to open wifi using that. I've bought a few of these that I use for remote location projects (i.e. gps tracking or telematics) running a rooted android phone that I have wired up to a longer battery and a few other doodads. The whole setup costs me $25 to start and around $10/mo for about 200mb of data and however many minutes they come up with. I can totally see a homeless person doing that, especially since you can get free minutes/service through a few of the local government aid providers. "

Maybe a YMCA or shelter.

The homeless population is highly variable.
Chronic homelessness is defined as being homeless for more than a year, or temporarily homeless for the 4th time in 3 years... and it's relatively uncommon compared to short-term homelessness.
The US Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates 2,000,000 homeless per year... but only about 112,000 fit the definition of chronic homelessness. Far more accurate local studies suggest it's a bit higher, but this is pretty close.
Oh- and about 45% of them have jobs (and that's just official, taxable jobs... off book work is estimated to bring the homeless employment rate in line with the national employment rate)- just no home, in between homes and relying on the YMCA or shelters to get them through the gaps.

For those of us who have experienced short-term homelessness, libraries and the YMCA are how you tread water, and look for a way out."

1191,peanutbutterjams,"There's some truth in what you've said re: greater utility = greater responsibility.

The problem with your post is that it ignores that women weren't ALLOWED to participate in those areas of greater responsibility.

In your post, the scenario reads like ""Men offered to share responsibility, women refused, men took up the reigns and so were due a greater amount of respect and authority.""

In actuality, the scenario was more like ""As a result of their bondage to gender norms of the past, men continued to dominate areas of responsibility and often denigrated or denied women who sought to share that responsibility.""

Does this mean that female engineering students should have access to networking and job opportunities that are denied to men? No, that's just perpetuating the crime you're supposedly abolishing. 

Fact: Men so heavily dominated art and STEM largely because there wasn't equitable access to those fields.

Should this fact decrease our perception of the value of those men's contributions in those fields? No, but it does anyways amongst many in the Left.

No one is trying to downplay the violence that people who live on the street must endure, but from my understanding from stats and personal experience ~~female~~, female homeless have a huge huge risk of rape and sexual assault if they are not sheltered. And keep in mind these statistics take into account that homeless women receive priority shelter and have for several decades. Yet, their risk is still higher than that of men. If you are truly interested in homelessness, there are many books written on this subject. They may be enlightening as to why there appears to be favoritism of one group over another. I suspect that the networks of publicly and privately funded non-profits (many overburdened volunteers and social workers) that shelter the homeless have evolved a system to protect the greatest number of people from physical harm.

1276,RandomlyJim,"I've been short term homeless before.  For 8 weeks in 2008, the peak of the financial meltdown, I found myself having to choose between food or rent.

I had a job and wasn't lazy.  Thought this period, I worked every day.  I was an unlucky victim to the mortgage crisis.  I was one of thousands of mortgage guys making 6 figures who suddenly found himself making far less in a very short time frame.   

 In 16 months, I had two companies go bankrupt underneath me owing me thousands in pay.   One sent me a check months later that I happily deposited.  I quickly used the money to pay bills, only to see that check bounce along with all the checks I had just written.  I was further in the hole.  A third company decide to just not pay me and instead fired me just before pay day with the promise of a pay check in the mail that never arrived.  I was told to sue but couldn't afford the filing fees. 

I always had a job lined up in 24 hours so I just buried myself in the work and try to dig out.

This Great Recession sucked and because it was stretched out over such a long period, I depleted my emergency fund.   I cut expenses but some I couldn't get out of quick enough.   Only when filing taxes the next year did I realize that my income had fallen 90%.  From 175,000 in one year to just over 18,000 the next.

I finally said fuck it and packed everything I owned into my car and slept in it for 2 months.  I wore suits to work so I'd hang them up in the passenger seat.  I'f shower at the office gym early in the morning.  I used the office fridge to store food.  I'd be the first in and the last out the door.   To keep people from asking questions, I'd park my car at the farthest corner of the lot.  It was embarrassing.

I lied to my mom.  I lied to my coworkers.   I hid.  I also realized that several of my coworkers in my finance job were in the same situation. They gave financial advice during the day but were all in desperate financial straits themselves. 

The old guy who lived in the minivan, the young guy that wanted to be a DJ was living in his Eclipse, the other guy that wore a dress shirt with a tear from the armpit to the waist hidden beneath his suit jacket was obviously Couch-Hopping.  We were all desperate, hungry, broke liars.

When they fired the DJ with the eclipse and the guy with the tear and a shirt, I panicked. I saw the hurt and the fear in their eyes as I walked out the door and realized that I could be next.

I had met a woman who was older than me, lonely, sexy, and living her own financial lie but she had a home.  She had asked me out and we had met for dinner a few times.  I told her that my apartment was converting to Condos and she invited me to stay with her.  

She was my way out of homelessness.   It was a little over 8 weeks of living in my car, showering in a a gym, eating baloney nearly every meal, and pretending everything was okay.   It took another two years before it really was.   


My wife doesn't know about my homelessness.  She thinks it's sweet that I give every dollar I have on me to homeless with hustle.  She doesn't know that I give that money because I know that it's just a series of bad days between me and them.

And yet, in the past the West did a much better job in circumstances like child custody, where even a poor man was presumed the custodial parent provided he worked, contrasting with our own age where the homeless and millionaires alike have their lives ruined and livelihoods stolen by the family court racket. 

In Late Middle Ages Germany a man was liable for his wife's debts and could even be imprisoned for his wife's overspending while she remained free. But he also was the only one who had a say in the local council. Superior responsibility balanced by superior authority. Nowadays not only can all women vote but men are still imprisoned in their thousands each year due to inability to pay the court costs and alimony and child support that go to women >90% of the time, even if the child isn't his.

Instead of continuing this trend to up sympathy for men by saying

> ...and men (77 per cent) are over-represented...

 they choose instead to frame it in the context of women being homeless because they know that people view men as disposable and would shrug at the 77% statistic, but people would be more upset about women being being homeless, thus they focus it on them, instead. This is blatantly apparent in the fact that they gray out the men in the infographic.

Yes, the statistics are accurate, but the presentation of it hints at misandry by continuing the trend of focusing on the hardships of women, even when men are clearly the ones at a disadvantage.

Statistics can be true and presentation of statistics can be tone deaf.

For example, if I listed the number of white people shot by cops and called it a travesty that we were shooting that many white people, it'd be both true and tone deaf to the fact that white people probably have the least per-capita deaths via cops of any race (well... maybe not Asians.

It might not seem like an issue on it's own but remember that MRAs on this sub have seen this happen time and time again with a variety of issues. This isn't a coincidence or a one-time thing, there's a consistent pattern of mentioning when something is more likely to affect other groups (like Aboriginals or LGBT in this article) but refuse to mention when it's more likely to affect males. 

You'll see this with other issues too. When you read articles about the war on drugs or mass incarceration or police brutality they'll talk about racism, but never mention that it's almost all men who are being targeted. And in some cases they even emphasize women and try to make it sound like women are the victims. It's just an extension of male disposability, like when you read an article saying ""12 people were killed, including 1 woman."""

All male dominated (mostly because they tend to demand a high risk for those who CAN lift heavy items let alone those who can't). Yet, I don't hear too many people saying we should hire more female factory labourers. 

The pay gap does exist. As an average. But with the amount of SUPER high earning men, it's not a surprise. People like Gates push that gap so incredibly far out it's really not funny. But it's not called gender inequality. It's called rich people earning lots of money. 

Yet, with the 1% owning like 99% of the wealth, and most of them being men, how is the pay gap only 20 or so percent? Because at the level 99% of people work, we all earn roughly the same, at least compared to others in our industry. "

Yes, since women constitute the majority of those who rape men. Somewhere between 60-80% which means the male number could be 60%-80% higher. 

They say 55.9% of women had been subject to rape, which in most surveys seems to include completed, attempted and drug facilitated. 

They say 14.3% of men experienced completed rape. I don't know if these two statistics are comparable, because they could be measuring two completely different things--the female number inclusive of completed, attempted and drug facilitated while the male number is just completed rape--but even if they are...

Removing 60-80% of the rape men experience means that 14.3% could be more like 35.75-57.2%.

>they come up with a modified question list for men and do not even use VAWA

The relevant quote that included this graphic in the print paper is here:

>Nearly a third of those living in shelters year-round are employed, according to the survey.

>Aboriginals (38 per cent), people who identify as LGBTQ2+ (13 per cent) and veterans (11 per cent) are over-represented in the homeless population.

>Women make up 23 per cent of the homeless population.

Note that in this context ""over-represented"" means relative to their representation in the city's population as a whole. For example when less than 11% of Vancouver's total population are veterans then their ""disproportionate representation"" in the homeless population indicates a systemic problem facing veterans. Which you've probably heard about before.

Note that the statistic on women is *not indicated to be over-representative nor contextualized with any political statement*. It's delivered purely for public interest. So has that changed your criticism of the article at all?

Why do you mix the three together? The police is a respectable career, impossible for most kids to get into. Granted the military can recruit hard amongst the poor, but for many it's the only way out of poverty. They have no choice. Those that do have a choice tend to enter at officer level. Construction is only worthwhile if you can learn a trade, and those opportunities are rare. There is no 'pay and status' that comes with labouring without a trade. And that is the trade that is responsible for most workplace deaths, by far. And wouldn't you know it, women only make up <5% of the workforce.

Not in a society based on capitalism. Women can do a lot of things that men can do but there are physical jobs that would take 2 women to do the job of 1 man. 2 employees cost more money than 1 employee. In a capitalist society, this doesn't make financial sense.

I will use the job of a roofer as an example but this can be applied to many labor jobs. You just aren't going to find many women who can haul 100 lbs bundles of shingles up a ladder and onto a roof. 2 women with 2 ladders could get the 100lbs of shingles up on the roof but then the roofing job cost just doubled and they will go out of business. Men are born with about 60% more muscle than women and this means that most men will be able to do hard manual jobs better and quicker than most women.

On one hand it's the one statistic in the article that can most easily be converted into a filler graphic.  But would agree that the use of colour could indicate some bias. The phrasing itself, emphasing 1 in 4 of the total population, fits the way the statistic is expressed. They don't say 89% of them weren't veterans.

Also, women, as a demographic, aren't to blame for men being homeless. Especially in context with the modern epidemic, I'd suggest you look to the state and financial institutions for the cause of those problems. I don't understand who could trick you into thinking women have anything to do with this. And if you're going to blame a group of politically active women for focusing their attention on issues applicable to them personally instead of an issue you think is more important, you can just as easily apply that criticism to the American Diabetes Assocation or the NRA. In fact I'd suggest you apply it to the politicians that continue to cut and obstruct proper funding or progressive solutions to these sorts of problems."

You're basically doing the inverse of their fallacy bullshit. They pretend a woman forcing a man to penetrate her isn't rape.

1453,shaolin_cowboy,"Hello everyone. I'm a single dad. I feel like my son is many times more safe with me than with his mom. Before I got my son, my ex had lots of boyfriends, and the last one she was with was an ex-con who was in and out of jail a lot. 

I've come to realize a couple things. One, it is easier for a woman to find a man in the dating world than the other way around. Everyone knows this but few admit it for whatever reason. So the probability of a woman having multiple men in their lives is higher than most men having multiple women. Multiple people coming in a child's home probably increases the odds of something bad happening to the child, but I don't have the data, except from my own experience with my ex. I would think it would create a less stable environment. I have had my child for three years now, and in that span of time I only had one relationship with a woman and it only lasted a month. That was it. I don't really see myself meeting anyone new any time soon either. The dating scene is very bad for men these days if you ask me. I've also learned recently that women without kids don't want to date men with children. The reverse is not as true I don't think. Personally, I would not want to date a woman with more than two kids (but I might make an exception depending on the circumstances), mostly because that is a lot of responsibility, but one or two kids, I'm ok with that as long as the mother is a responsible person, and I was even this way before I had my son. However, I have seen lots of online dating profiles where women don't want guys with kids and I also had a lady turn me down recently because I had a kid. 

So for the past three years, it has mostly just been me and my son. He has had his own room (for the first time in his life) and a safe environment in which to grow. I'm also college educated and work in computers. We have a total of four computers in our apartment and his computer skills have increased a great deal because of this. He sometimes surprises me and learns things I never even knew about. He actually installed hardware like the Steam Link himself and configured a programmable keypad on his $45 gaming mouse all by himself. He never really had these opportunities before. 

The point is that society needs to stop assuming that the mother is always the better choice. I can't stress enough how much this needs to change. I wanted to tell my own story because I know there are dads out there still struggling, still being stereotyped by society, and still not seeing justice. Some guys out there might disagree with my story, and to this I would say I am speaking from my own experience in life. My experience may not be typical, but it is true to my own existence.

Seriously though, there are a lot of bad fathers and a lot of bad mothers, but there are a lot kids living with bad single mothers who have used the court system and their gender to rob men of their children. This rarely helps anyone aside from the mother herself. The father and the child both suffer from that situation. A child who doesn't have a relationship with his/her father almost always has serious issues growing up that persist through adulthood. 

If I look back on all the people I've met throughout my life, kids I met in school, people I've worked with etc... almost every person who had serious issues was raised by a single mother. This doesn't necessarily mean the mothers were bad, that's not what I'm saying. But it does show, to me at least, that it's very important to have a stable home for raising children, or at least let a child have their father as a role model and active participant in their life. Shutting out the dad when he did nothing wrong usually destroys two lives while only making one life, that of the mother, marginally more pleasant. The fact that everyone in our media and education system keep selling us a vision of society that undermines the importance of men as fathers seems like we're being set up for a social disaster. The destruction of the family unit will result in the destruction of our society. "

1647,bexmex,"There was a divorce lawyer on /r/bestof/ a few weeks back talking about this... his argument was that its actually a bit of a myth that *courts* grant women custody most of the time. What typically happens (90%) is that both parents agree before it gets to court what the custody arrangement will be, and the courts usually spend their time banging out financial stuff.

In the situation where custody is contested, its like Judge Judy says: its 50/50 who deserves custody. If a man can present evidence that the woman is unfit, he has a good chance of winning custody.

The problem is that the *older* judges (typically conservative men) think its woman's work to raise kids, and side with the mom more often than they should. The younger judges (women and moderate men) consider raising kids to be a mutual responsibility, and are much more likely to believe the father that the mother is unfit.

Counterintuitively, it looks like you're better off with a young female judge than an older male judge if you want custody of your kids...

So the vast majority of the cases, the parents are adult enough to actually be able to work together for the best of the children, regardless if it's Sweden or the US, though Sweden is somewhat better it seems at making joint custody work. But looking at just the cases where they for whatever reason can't do that, the outlook is grim indeed, because it's less than half a percent where the father has sole custody... less than HALF A FUCKING PERCENT, where in the US, it's about 4%.

This wouldn't be a problem of any real importance except for whatever retarded political reasons, there are many places you can legally bring an attack-grade dog but are not allowed to carry a pistol (for example, parks and schools).  Rendering a parent of small children defenseless against a pair of mauling pits (or other breed).

They tape the show two or three days every other week with each taping day resulting in about a week's worth of new cases. With a couple longer breaks throughout the year, in total they tape the show only 52 days a year. Not sure if she thinks of it that way or if it is even legitimate to think of it that way, but $900k per workday just blows my mind. Got that off both the TV Show's and her Wikipedia page. 

"
1714,AFlyingNun,"She's got her good qualities, but she's also got some bad ones. Her commentary about money has often been a bad point for me.

Another thing I never liked about her is how harsh she can be with the unemployed. She always seems heavily biased against people without a job or with small time jobs (even remember one story where she seemed hostile towards a guy who was a welder and implied he probably doesn't make enough, when wtf welders actually earn quite well), and I've always been disgusted by that mindset. Seems lacking in empathy for those that may truly be going through a rough patch (not doubting she's seen plenty of deadbeats though, just saying don't judge by job alone), plus I know my dad is so obsessed with the job title he has that he'd willingly screw over his own child or his own brother if it meant advancing his social status.

1723,,"As a judge, you have to develop that disposition. It's not rude or disrespectful, it's her knowing through years of practising law that you can't get the facts of a case if you just let people go on with their story. Nor can you waste the time of the court letting someone drone on and on about unrelated topics.

To keep the story straight and judge the case properly, you need answers to questions. Not a story, not some unrelated bullshit, not an opinion. Judge asks specific question, judge requires specific answer. 

On top of that you have to maintain an atmosphere of respect towards yourself as the judge so that people don't try to pull one over on you.

And lastly you WANT to put pressure on the people there, especially if you suspect someone is lying. Most people are bad at lying, and when put under strict pressure and questioning their story will start to break down and they will show signs of nervousness.

We settled supervision ourselves. unless  the  ex had something planned i could pretty much see the kids whenever i wanted, keep him for the weekend, etc etc.  I was still able to feel like a father. You will  miss things. Its just a side effect of being separated, but in the end  I still believe I  made the right decision. I have a great relationship with my teenaged son

Not all of that is intentional. Lots of media shoved down your throat just wants you to believe kids make your life suck, or they are so hard that it's not worth it.

Unless you're absolutely against having kids, go find a nice woman somewhere and start a family. You've got a limited window of time to do it. Kids are cool. Families are cool. Fathers raising their own kids are cool. Don't fall for the lure of the media that you're a fuckup just like every TV dad who gets bullied by his TV wife.

In some places, just saying that you both are married is legal enough. 

Point stands. Don't get ""married"" . Two people can love each other and be happy without the need for marriage. "
1764,Baridi,"As a divorcee, this is pretty much all truth in a failed marriage. I spent the last few months of my failed marriage (And even the subsequent failed relationship) just being consistently annoyed by her drama. Because all her trashy friends and family kept giving her advice that causing drama every chance she got would somehow slow down making me care less. That seems to be the mindset of many women, turning every petty molehill into a mountain is somehow supposed to make me care. Pretending to make it important to you does not translate to making it important to me.

About the ""Trashy"" comment. She was perfectly taken care of when she was with me. She didn't have any bills. I paid for her phone, rent, car, just about all the bills (She paid for netflix, whoopee), and she bummed my smokes. She got a job at Wal-Mart but instead of helping out, she spent 90% of her money on fast food and stupid crap she'd use once and then return. She got really fat... and I mean REALLY fat. Normally wouldn't be a problem, as I'm into bigger women, but she was also a complete slob. Her parents were worthless, my family had to pay for the entire wedding. Her parents didn't even bother to show up.

Also, you do lose your hobbies, friends, and interests when you're married. Everything has to be about her. Everything. But thankfully I never lost my opinions. I'd just roll my eyes whenever she thought her opinion mattered more than mine and said some completely disarming comment.

I know I was a complete asshole in the last few months of the relationship, but she basically battered any romance, attraction or sensitivity I had for her out of me. I couldn't have fun or time to myself. I couldn't even do anything I loved anymore. If I played video games on my laptop she'd start a fight that I wasn't paying attention to her enough. If I wanted to watch college football(Which is only one day of the week for 3 hours) She'd intentionally cause drama so it'd ruin the whole experience for me. If I wanted to have a couple of drinks, she'd go around my entire family and tell them I'm an alcoholic. I basically had quit drinking altogether for half of my marriage. Yet she was constantly playing Destiny on her Xbox, and would go out almost every other night to get shitfaced with her white trash Wal-Mart friends. 

Long story short, that marriage was doomed from the get-go. Also, to the ass-hat below me who thinks this shit only happens to pushovers? The only reason I got married in the first place is that there was a point in time where she wasn't a complete nightmare. She took care of my mom when I was on the wrong side of a prison visitation window. Decidedly not a pushover.

The final straw was when she heard female voices over my skype chat (I was talking to my guiid on WoW) and when I went to go to the bathroom she grabbed and smashed my laptop. Luckily she was too stupid to smash the actual computer part, and just broke the screen.(At least I could connect it to a TV and still use it while I waited for my new one to arrive.) I ignored her completely for around two weeks, then she implied she was cheating on me. So I kicked her out. She took her clothes, got in her car, and drove back to the West coast to her parents. Never saw her again. Good riddance. Now I heard she got into meth and is running around with a Neo-Nazi (She's not white) Maybe I should feel bad about the meth part, but the Neo-Nazi part just kinda cancelled it out."

It used to be that since men had **all** the responsibility for the family and children he also had all the rights to them. Now men still have all the responsibility, and none of the rights.

And as for the ""women couldn't vote"" deal, women also did not have to sign up for the draft. They never paid the price to vote, so they didn't get the reward. It's a simple concept, yet nobody ever seems to take beef with the idea that women would ever have to buy their rights with their lives like men do. Now women have those rights, and still hold no responsibility. At no point in history have women had the short end of the stick, it used to be balanced to her responsibilities.

1799,zombiehive,"You could just Google ""mother custody rights history"" and you will find info better than a paraphrased reddit comment that can't go into nuances.  But basically, until the 19th century, English law granted custody automatically to the father. It wasn't until women were granted property rights that they were able to stake a claim to their children."
1800,Gentlescholar_AMA,"1700s-1800s.

So you have to remember that this is going to be an English thing, because of course England was the first European country to allow divorce and that was in the mid-1500s. Which would have still been taboo... jeez, into the 1800s. And totally unacceptable on the continent until a similar time.

So this history is really a history of around the enlightenment era, which is the period of the utmost oppression of women maybe anywhere on Earth at any time; including saudi arabia today.

Women became seen as stupid, prone to fits, needy, failing to produce anything worthwhile, etc. And reading literature from the period it's incredible what women were told to do.

A woman worried 90% about her appearance. That was what a woman was for: reproduction and not being a burden on her husband beyond necessary. This is why during this period women get these insanely elaborate costumes that take hours to put on and are so bad for your health, things to make your waist look incredibly slim, hoops to exaggerate the hips, layers upon layers of fabric and undergarments, you get the picture. 

You might be imagining a black and white photo right now; you're almost there. That's *1800s* after things had toned down. *1700s* was even more extreme. 

so, because of this, it was understood that of course women were unfit to be parents. Women were incompetent grown children themselves, except also prone to fainting, hysteria, fits, panics, and so on. Plus, she couldn't work except as a maid, nanny, or other servant, and it was unfitting for a child to be running around in a rich person's house belonging to one of the servants.

Prior to this period (when divorce was illegal mind you), restrictions on women were not nearly so severe. You can read in English literature from 1500's and before that women could work in most jobs although it might be a little odd, and men seemed to fall more deeply and fully in love with women than just seeking an heir factory."
1801,getintheVandell,"The point is equality, and to be mindful of the painful history of suffering women had to go endure for literally centuries. Women's suffrage and equality is a recent phenomenon, so of course they're going to fight tooth and nail to keep it, as they should.

In other words, a whopping two-thirds of the hospital's dog-attack injuries involved just two breeds, pit bulls and Rottweilers.

Other studies confirm these statistics: A 15-year study published in 2009 in the American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology revealed that pit bulls, Rottweilers and German shepherds were responsible for the majority of fatal dog attacks in the state of Kentucky."""

He is an outstandingly qualified moderate and was the pick most hoped for by Democrats among Trump's options. Attempts to block him from office are classical obstructionism, and Republicans putting him in the position over their objections was done repeatedly with other appointed federal official confirmations by Democrats during Republican obstructionism."

1862,Gentlescholar_AMA,"A woman could be denied access to her kids if the husband felt like denying her access. She had no power of her own during the period. And since she couldn't work, where do you think she lived?

Keep in mind: divorces were rare, and social graces were important. The husband would need some kind of evidence that his wife was hysterical or something to get a divorce in the first place. Perhaps that she cheated, something like that. In which case, yeah he would argue that she shouldn't be around the children."
1863,sunsmoon,"This is the time of Coverture (which was loosed up around the time of the Market Revolution in the US). Coverture is when a woman loses her legal identity after marriage - all property she owned prior to marriage belongs to her husband, she cannot enter into contracts of any kind, she couldn't *go to school.* She couldn't even attempt to seek a divorce because it would require her husband to agree to it and ""sign off,"" since her legal standing is entirely the husbands domain. 

Coverture lost some of its appeal in the US during the Civil War because so many men were away from the home. Even then, the women in charge of the home were *Deputy Husbands*, highlighting that in order to enter contracts, buy/sell property, manage a business, etc, one had to be a husband (and therefore, male) to do it effectively. The letters between soldiers and their wives during that era is very interesting!

There are two types of post military compensation, but they both equal 100% of your compensation (horrible description. bear with me).

You retire from the military with 100% retirement benefits.

You go to the VA and get your bad knees classified as a service related disability at 20%.

You can choose to keep the 100% retirement, or take 80% retirement and 20% disability.

Retirement benefits are split upon divorce, but disability benefits are not.

**Here are the specifics of this case:**

This man had 100% retirement benefits, but had a classified disability. He choose to reduce his retirement benefits (thereby reducing the portion that his wife received every month) by taking his disability benefits. 

She took him to court, and had them take more than 50% of the 80% + 20% disability.

1884,deten,"> English Law gave custody to fathers until the 19th century

Got it.  This seems different than your original claim.  Above you agreed that...

>women were being thrown out on the streets and denied access to their children at the rate that is happening to men in the U.S.

and

>Women being able to take custody of their children is a relatively new phenomenon.

Now you're seem to be focusing more specifically on English Law.  But English law is only a portion of the world (and varied through time itself).  I know for a fact that we can find scenarios where men were treated unfairly, and other scenarios where women were treated unfairly.  I am not arguing that isn't the case (i'm not really arguing anything, I just want to know the truth because I like believing true things).

Which is part of the reason I asked for what led you to this belief.

All to say, I think I am convinced that point is true that from some point up until the 19th century english law gave custody to fathers.  I am not convinced that the original point you made is true, which is listed above: That women were being thrown out into the streets and denied access to their children at a rate that is happening to men in the US, or that women being able to take custody of their children is a relatively new phenomenon.

Maybe you can elaborate on what you actually believe, because I wonder if we're just having a misunderstanding..."

The rate of being thrown out or whatever is not the issue under discussion, but the automatic granting of rights to mothers; the bit that says ""relatively new phenomenon"" means ""in the last hundred years"" rather than in the previous thousand (ish) under English law.

I've seen this happening, some of my good friends were a bunch of girls all living together. Whenever one was out of the room they would all gang up on her.

Gendered issues should be tackled no matter what the gender of the victim, not matter the gender of the perp. Women pressure eachother when it comes to clothing. Men pressure eachother when it comes showing/not showing emotion. Just because the people ""at fault"" are of the same gender doesn't mean that it's less of a problem.

We saw this during the 2016 election too, women are more often judged by what they wear and it hurts them more often. 

Also, I think this again points to this sub being anti-feminism or rather anti-people-saying-sexism-happens because I definitely can't see how this infringes on men's rights or how it relates to them either. Like, do you guys realize that feminism is not against men's rights and you don't have to fight them and it doesn't hurt men to support equal treatment? If you're really for men's rights, why does it seem you're more concerned with being against feminism? The two are not the same. "

2020,Abe_Vigoda,"This issue isn't really male or female centric but it does tend to influence women more. It has nothing to do with 'male advantage' though.

The fashion/beauty industries are somewhat relentless and have a ton of ways that they influence people to buy stuff.

Here's a commercial that they air lately selling crest whitestrips:

https://youtu.be/AP3sCUbChlI

Having glowing white teeth is purely aesthetic. This product doesn't do anything for your actual dental health, it's purely cosmetic. In the commercial, they promote the idea that if your teeth aren't white enough next to a Kleenex, then you suck basically. Personally, the girl seems to have mental health issues and her friend is an enabler.

Men are actually sort of lucky that we aren't targeted quite as much as women to adhere to these bullshit marketing tricks but that doesn't mean that we aren't victims of the same type of ad shenanigans.

Men & women are targeted differently. There is a lot of overlap for common products but women are hit with this stuff from more angles. There is a lot more media that is geared towards women and it's all trying to sell something.

This stuff has been going on for decades too. It's generational and a lot of people learn these kinds of behaviors early on when they're kids. One of the earliest constructs kids learn is the concept of 'cool'. Advertisers market 'cool' stuff to impressionable kids and they get hooked on the idea that to be 'cool', they have to fit a certain image or ideal that usually depends on spending money.

People put more effort into trying to impress strangers than just trying to please themselves as a result.

It bugs me that this is in /r/mensrights and used as a way to cause more hostility between men & women because this is an issue that affects everyone regardless of gender.

Companies and people selling stuff causes these attitudes. 'Men' really have nothing to do with it unless they work in the ad/marketing industries but there's plenty of women working the fields too.

It's better to blame aggressive capitalists for these self esteem crushing attitudes since they're the ones who force it on everyone else."

I'm thinking of smart outfits or people in the media when I say this. For example, I'm thinking of our current UK prime minister (female) who wears bright outfits that are super easy to spot when worn more than once and easy to match to the type of event they are worn to (she wore her bright orange suit meeting president trump and to the UK general election: it's described by the media as her power outfit). I literally cannot remember a time when I thought the previous male prime minister wore the same outfit more than once as they all looked largely similar.

Actually we realize that feminism **is** against men's rights. MRAs have learnt this from personal experience. Do you know who the only group of people who protest Men's Rights conferences and activists is? Yes, feminists; there are 'tradcons' and conservative minded people who don't care about men's issues but they don't obstruct, derail and pull fire alarms at MRA activism spaces. (I think the only issue tradcons obstruct is MGM, in all other cases it is always feminists). Maybe there are feminists who aren't against MRAs, but each and every MRA has a personal account of a feminist dismissing men's issues, mocking men, straight up obstructing men's progress or make a men's issue all about women."

This is obviously false, and has been for decades. Look up Erin Pizzey.

Failing to fight feminism kept men's rights issues in the dark for a long, long, *long* time. As soon as MRAs began fighting feminism, men's rights have become more and more mainstream. I would really like it if you were correct, but you're just not.

> and it doesn't hurt men to support equal treatment

2201,WikiTextBot,"**Internalized sexism**

Internalized sexism is one of the three theorized subsets of sexism other than institutionalized discrimination and interpersonal sexism. Unlike its counterparts, which are sexism in social interactions, internalized sexism occurs more so on an individual level. Internalized sexism is when an individual enacts sexist actions and attitudes towards themselves and people of their own sex. On a larger scale, internalized sexism falls under the broad topic of internalized oppression, which ""consists of oppressive practices that continue to make the rounds even when members of the oppressor group are not present"".

When I was growing up, brand status was something that (for the shallow people) determined if you were a *cool kid* or not. I had high school peers who talked about how their parents spent a couple Grand on their back to school clothes, which was something I couldn't even fathom at the time. In exchange for doing household chores (lawn mowing, fire wood stacking, dishes, vacuuming, ect), my parents gave me a solid budget of $200 for all my back to school supplies and clothes. I'd go clearance shopping to get a couple new outfits and then all my notebooks, book covers, and pencils I'd need for the year. I usually didn't even spend all that money. Brand name anything was a splurge.

This coming with the understanding that I was privileged over some of my other peers, who would spend their summers raking blueberries to pay for their back to school supplies. 

Of you grow up in a place where how you dress is part of your status, then yeah... You're going to be more concerned with your wardrobe. I'm all for minimalism in personal fashion.

2304,JulianneLesse,Usually it is 'internalized misogyny' because it inscribes much less agency than 'toxic masculinity' 
2305,RapeMatters,">I've never heard the phrase used before

Exactly.  They call it ""internalized misogyny"".  The men who are victimized by horrible sexism are responsible for their victimization - hence ""toxic masculinity"", regardless of source (and, pro-tip, what evidence we have suggests women are the primary enforcers of the male gender role currently, although that may or may not have always been true).  The women who are victimized by horrible sexism specifically from other women are suffering victimization in the form of ""internalized misogyny""."
2306,GothicDreamScape,"> Maybe I phrased it wrong? I've never heard the phrase used before but feminists 100% for sure address toxic behaviours of women. E.g. ""tearing other women down"".

""Toxic masculinity"" is defined as a behavior associated with the male gender role that harms oneself and others.  

Fascinating that when feminists describe toxic femininity they choose ""harming other women"" rather than eg harming men and children.  

A proper definition of toxic femininity would include things like: playing damsel in distress, failing to take responsibility, blaming men, using proxy violence, treating children like possessions, gossiping, irrationality, valuing female life more than male life, being emotionally manipulative, discriminating romantically against working class men, etc. etc.   In other words: feminism.

2309,guitarguy109,"I'd say they're more common here but still within the realm of ""few and far between"" like you describe."
2310,BlockNotDo,I'm convinced its a regional thing.  Women taking pleasure and joy in shaming men was pretty typical when I lived in the midwest.  Moved to the Southeast and the women here are generally kind.
2311,hai-sea-ewe,"It's a cultural thing: local, regional, and in some cases, (more or less) national.

Women who do that I think live in a low power ratio environment - one where they might have more opportunity to pick new partners and find satisfaction in their relationships than the men do, but are culturally shamed for doing so. When there just aren't as many (relatively speaking) women of available and a certain culturally-defined level of attractiveness around, women have to ""shame"" men who cheat (or just don't live up to their standards), because being shamed by a man who doesn't treat them with respect (when there are so many other available men around) makes the woman seem weak and foolish for staying with him, even though she would be shamed for not being ""loyal."" It's a hell of a catch-22, and it doesn't excuse their shitty behavior. But it is more subtle than just ""women are evil just because.""

On the other hand, if there are few men and many women, or if there is an equal-ish ratio and everybody is pretty comfortable with themselves, women will be nicer to men and more catty with each other, because there is more competition and they find themselves in competition with the other women rather than being in competition with a man's sense of loyalty. "
2312,Diogenes--,"There are two types of womens' subreddits.  1) Those which manually ban you the minute you express the slightest disagreement 2) Those which run a bot which automatically bans you if you have ever posted in any loosely-defined ""mens"" subreddits like this one, kia, tia, rp, etc.  2x used to be 1, but recently became 2.  And most womens' subs were already 2.

I read the words of a post and react based on those words.  If I respond, I respond to those words.  I'm against censorship because I understand that I'm not the center of the universe, and that other people can and will disagree with me, and that's OK.  The fact that women, as a group, engage in censorship on reddit and elsewhere tells me that they view things very differently than I do.  Disagreeing with them is seen as a threat and they disallow it when & where they have the power to do so.  Instead of a rational argument in response to your words, their response is usually a commentary on your post history (as if that has any impact on the words you wrote), a personal insult (""you just can't get laid, lol!""), and/or a ban if you're in their ""safe space"".

At the extreme of this, a woman in Canada recently took a man there to court because he disagreed with her on the internet.  His posts were reasoned and logical, btw, he didn't call her names or threaten her.  Her prosecution argument was that by disagreeing with her, he was making her ""feel"" threatened.  While he won, he had to crowdsource almost $50k in legal fees, and the case being tried set a precedent that women can take men to court for disagreeing with them.

Seriously, think about how serious this is.  Feminist dogma is so wrong and fragile that it can't stand up to a rational discussion.  Instead of acknowledging this and allowing reality to dictate some changes to their beliefs, they engage in censorship and even legal action.  Does this remind you of anything?  The witch trials, perhaps?  Or the persecution by the church of science and ""heresy""?  Galileo specicially?  Like I said in another reply elsewhere in this thread, the more things change, the more they stay the same.  History repeats.  Etc. "

They're also photographed all over town and that is often a function of their clothing as well. The whole thing exists to get women excited about new trends in fashion. If a celeb wore the same black dress four years in a row, yes, they would be criticized. But the thing is they make millions of dollars and that's basically part of their job. 

However, a normal woman could absolutely be seen as pretty presentable and successful and good looking just like a man could, by having a couple of nice dresses and accessories, just like a man might have a few suits, a tux, a seersucker, a nice gray or blue one. If you change it up a lot you're seen as ""fashionable"" not as normal. If you have a stand-out item, like a tie/suit combo thats really flashy, it might be seen as weird worn twice because that signals that you are fashionable, just like a bright floral dress would.

I will tell you, I was raised with that sort of philosophy, and it served me well, but I missed one part.

Add in ""and earn the most possible"" and you will excel super quick. I began reviewing the highest paying professions, globally. Generally speaking you can just look for whatever Switzerland is focusing on, and those will be the highest earners.

From there, I effectively stopped doing what I was doing and converted over to mastering block chain (but there are many other type of choices). If you learn the highest paying jobs, degrees won't matter.

Over the course of 15 years of work, I had saved $80,000 roughly. One year after moving over to block chain my savings increased to $250,000 - And I am now paid close $1,000,000 per year vs $50,000 before.

Living humbly is one half of the puzzle, maximizing your worth is the other half. I recommend studying Benjamin Franklin. Here are some pamphlets I made :

Were you in a similar field already or just jump right in?

This was an inappropriate relationship that he started but her being an ADULT should have ended it before it began.

Her wanting to leave her husband and kids to make a life with me, and me thinking to myself wtf happened. How did it turn into this craziness. I was all alone after almost three years of lying to literally everyone to cover up our affair. I ended up breaking down and telling my mother everything, then I almost immediately went off to my freshman year of college and left it all in the past. I'm almost 24 now and that experience has without a doubt changed my life. I was depressed for years and constantly thought of suicide. It's turned out ok now and I'm in a good place thanks to good people, but not a day goes by that I don't think about what happened and how that came to be.

My conclusion is that feminism is sold as a brand. All of this, a part of neoliberalism. They are selling to the masses and to themselves a certain.. zeitgeist so whatever they write must promote the zeitgeist - it seems to be a sort of bias. Perhaps groupthink or something related to it. Labeling ""female child rapist"" does not fit into the promotion of branded feminism; not the academic kind, the more complex kind.

2591,,"> statutory rape is still rape, it exists because underage kids are not capable of making good decisions in regards to sexual relationships.

I think that's part of why it exists. A minor has a very different legal standing than an adult. As citizens, minors have abridged rights, and this can create a number of compromising power dynamics if they're being coerced by an adult. Without protections in place, a legal adult acting as custodian of a minor child would have far too much leverage over said child."

2595,wylderk,"Sounds like he was consistently pestering her. Nothing in that article could ever be defined at ""seductive"", unless pure persistence is an act of seduction now."
2596,Hypertroph,"The ability to make a 'good' decision has no bearing on competence. It is the ability to clearly understand a decision and its consequences. 

That said, for some things of arguably similar significance, minors are able to make independent decisions. In the medical field, age may be an indicator for incompetence, but is not definitive. There have been minors as young as 14 who have, under their own power, refused treatment and had a court support their decision, even against the parents' wishes. 

So my question is, what makes sexual decision making so different? If a minor can be deemed competent enough to make life or death decisions, why are they incapable of making decisions based on who they sleep with? Sure, for the vast majority of minors, the law works. However, age alone should not automatically strip someone of their decision making ability simply because of antiquated, Puritan laws. "

Exactly. [Reread it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/5opx74/how_the_media_reports_female_child_rapists/dcll05g/) The editorialization that paints the victim as the seducer is inexcusable.

2600,ianyboo,"Serious question: what is the difference between decision making when it comes to sex and decision making when it comes to violence? 

For instance a 13 year old makes the decision to assault his female teacher and another makes the decision to have sex with his female teacher. Are 13 year olds capable of making decisions or not? Why do we treat one so much differently than the other?

(I'm not trying to defend any viewpoint here, just curious)"
2601,mwobuddy,"> But statutory rape is still rape, it exists because underage kids are not capable of making good decisions in regards to sexual relationships.

Uh, no it isn't. If it was ""classic rape"" or ""rape rape"", wherein she forced herself on the younger person, then that would be the law used.

The problem idiots like you have in calling this rape is that you're implying that rape is only a claim valid by law.

The implicit claim you're making is that if the age of consent was lowered to 12 tomorrow, this would no longer be rape because the law would allow it. If the age of consent was 12 tomorrow, then only ""rape rape"", the forcible or drugging kind, would be rape.

If all rape laws were removed tomorrow, I bet you'd still call it rape when a woman is forcibly held down and fucked at knife point. Why? Because rape is about sex with someone against their will.

If that was the case here,  that she had sex with the underage against their will, she would have been on trial for actual rape, not statutory 'rape'.

If you're implying that rape is solely based on age of consent violation, then a 17 year old that fucks their 25 year old boyfriend/girlfriend in Florida is a victim of rape (age of consent is 18 there), while a 17 year old doing the same in Nevada is not a victim of rape.

Rape is a real, serious act. It is a terrible act. It is NOT hinged on the law (as in the above examples, you are claiming that 17 year old are schrodinger's rape victims, either raped or not raped purely based on legal status).

Stop claiming age of consent determines whether someone was raped or not. You're demeaning actual victims of rape.

If age of consent violations magically make someone a victim of rape, then 13-17 year olds should be going to prison.

I have a test for you. If you consider violating someone's legal status of inability to consent rape (think a woman who has been drinking all night or been roofied and doesn't know what's going on; that's the area where law and everyone else agrees she has no capacity to consent, and would therefore be a victim of rape if a sober person fucked her), then one 13 to 17 year old encouraging another 13 to 17 year old is very explicitly raping that other underage person.

After all, their inability to consent by law is being violated. Rape is a serious, harmful act that should be punished as harshly as possible. Therefore, any 13 to 17 year old having ""willing"" sex with their boyfriend or girlfriend (lets be gender equalists), should be put on the sex offender list and sent to prison for ""child rape"".

What we should not be doing is giving them no punishment. If we found a 13 to 17 year old to be forcing someone of any age of sex (or taking advantage of someone who's been drinking a lot and passed out), we'd definitely put them on sex offender lists and charge them with rape.

If statutory rape is truly rape, we should be treating the underage no different from the overage and the underage who take advantage of passed out boys and girls, for they are violating another individuals lack of capability to consent/not consent.

Instead what we do is create laws that give exemptions to the underage, that is implicitly, a get out of jail free pass to commit child rape, if we believe that the age of consent proves that someone under that line cannot consent and is therefore a rape victim.

And here I thought rape was a serious act that should be punished as harshly as possible, but people don't want juveniles sent to jail for raping other juveniles.

Do you see how stupid it is now, to call age of consent violation rape?"

2619,,"""Seducing"" someone doesn't imply that the person being seduced is a conquest. It's just a word that assigns agency to one party involved in sexual courtship, and therefore responsibility.

I think that you've unnecessarily gendered the concept of rape culture. Your argument is that since the woman was treated as a prize, that means this case is still an example of how women are sexually victimized by society, and therefore stands as a piece of evidence *for* rape culture. This implies that the phrase ""rape culture"" is really just a synonym for ""sexual victimization, or, rape of  women culture,"" and I think it's this implicit gendered assumption that OP was arguing against. 

Assuming this is an epidemic for just one gender is a problem. There is a well documented body of research that men are victims of rape at equal rates to women (if you count being forced to penetrate as rape, which many law enforcement agencies do not, meaning most men forced to have sex are generally not counted as victims of rape). [Link](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/violence-crime/the-sexual-victimization-of-men-in-america-new-data-challenge-old-assumptions/)

Not only that, but several studies over the past few years that actually normalize for conviction and reporting biases, show that men are victims of sexual assault at similar rates to women, and that women are frequently the perpetrators. [Link to abstract, don't have full copy of the study at the moment, sorry](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178916301446)

This is a huge problem then, if we've started a political and cultural campaign that asserts women are so exclusively sexually victimized by men that we need to provide disproportionate resources in training law enforcement and judges in convicting male perpetrators. It's social and legal discrimination based off of bad data and cultural biases, and it provides a smokescreen for female perpetrators, like the one mentioned in the original article, to behave freely, when the resources to scrutinize for them are spent on finding men.

2620,Addictorator,"I think the title is as such because it was him who initiated the whole exchange and kept trying to flirt with her (according to her), and she did not reciprocate for a long time.

It is meant to mislead by making you focus on the fact the boy was asking her out, when in fact that should not fucking matter at all. 

Of course, the correct title should be ""Female Teacher Raped 13-Year-Old Student, And She Is In Jail, As She Should Be"".                  "

2665,armed_renegade,"Because they are easily manipulated into making decisions, especially by people with a form of power over the child, like a teacher.
Generally speaking though the analogy of children making medical decisions applies to a small minority of incidents. Whereas most are not capable of making that kind of decision, that's why the age of medical maturity is 16, not 13.

An adult is considered to know the difference between right and wrong, in all situations. And an adult, especially a teacher should know that sex, regardless of how much the child ""wants"" it, is wrong. If you reversed the sexes would your opinion change? A 13 year old girl with a 30-something male teacher.
Children are very easily manipulated, as are other people, such as those with downsyndrome or other mental disorders that affects their maturity. These people are known -where I live at least - ass vulnerable people. These people deserve extra protections because they are vulnerable. This is why laws such as statutory rape exist, because it protects vulnerable people."
2666,,"Okay, a small percentage of people in America likely have the physical and mental capability of driving 160 MPH on the highway without endangering anyone around them or themselves, just because some people are capable of it doesn't mean there should not be laws forbidding it.

Children are on the whole stupid and easily manipulated, I would say especially young boys. So if we deem that one boy had enough foresight to see the possible consequences of his actions and allowed him to fuck a 20 year old, where do we draw the line? And this kid was clearly not capable of maintaining a sexual relationship since he got the woman pregnant and was PLANING ON KEEPING THE BABY. Who the fuck is ready to be a father at 13?

 Sex can have serious consequences that last a lifetime or longer, and kids under a certain age should not be legally allowed to do it, and definitely not with an adult who can so easily manipulate them."
2667,Lacklub,That's exactly why juvenile court exists. If they assault someone then they're in the wrong. But it's not as serious as if a full adult assaulted someone.
2668,armed_renegade,"It comes down to the hierarchy of their relationship.
The teacher is essentially in a position of power over the 13 year old. And because of that alone it is already seen as bad.

Then there's the fact that a child is a vulnerable person. Their front lobes aren't as developed as an adult, so their decision making skills are pretty bad. But they are old enough to know the difference between right and wrong. They know that assaulting someone is wrong. But their ability to make a decision that isn't so easily defined as right or wrong to them.
The teacher is an adult whose frontal lobes are developed, so her decision making skills are there. And its pretty obvious regardless of if the child ""consents"" or not, that sex with a minor, a 13 year old at that (its not like the child was 17 years old).

So it comes down to a couple of things, the teacher has power over a vulnerable person, a child. The teacher also knows that is wwrong, regardless of whether or not the child ""agrees"" to it. Because you can't compare assault and sex. A child isn't as developed as an adult, so making choices about what happens to their body they aren't capable of making that."

>Rape culture is a term used in sociology to describe a setting in which rape is pervasive and normalized due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality.

I would argue that rape culture is a very broad brush, and that different cases arise from different societal attitudes of gender. Women being seen as conquests may be an attitude for this case, and men being seen as aggressors might also be an attitude in this case. They are not mutually exclusive ideas, and the latter attitude might also play into the ""men can't be raped"" idea. Both this case and the dismissal of men being victims of rape are manifestations of rape culture."

However, getting pregnant and aborting the 13 year old child's child after sexually assaulting them kinda warrants a bitch slapping by the court. That was probably the minimum the judge could do given the punishment required by the justice department. Additionally, if they let her off light then it would set legal precedence for actual offenders to get off with a lesser sentence. 

When people want the law enfored indiscriminately and harsly out of fear, this is what you get. In America you literally voted for the law to harshly punish criminals who sexualy abuse minors. Good luck getting any support from the general public for overturning the laws for less harsh ones. People would just read it as: ""You want to punish pedophiles *less* harshly?

So where I live there was an infamous case of a couple who prostituted out their 12 year old daughter, but because their ad said she was 18, and the place where the sex happened was quite dark, and supposedly she was 'mature looking', the police weren't able to prosecute the vast majority of people they identified as having sex with her.

Obviously the parents went to jail for a pretty long time.


But also a lot of places have a seperate crime of 'sex with a minor' that is distinguished from 'rape'. Because consent is a lot more legally complicated even when there is a legislated 'age of consent'.

In many circumstances a child can consent to many things if they are fully aware of the act and consequences (this comes up in things like teenagers wanting contraception without their parents knowing). So if someone not too far under the 'age of consent' still freely agrees to sex, it's often hard for the prosecution to prove that the sex meets the crime of rape."

2715,,"> I would argue that rape culture is a very broad brush, and that different cases arise from different societal attitudes of gender.

I'm just trying to distill this argument about gendered motivations a bit:

Men perpetrate sexual assault against women because they view them as objects and subsequently treat women as conquests.

Comparatively, Women perpetrate sexual assault against men (at comparable rates to male victimization of women) because they don't think men can be raped? 

You're not actually clarifying the motivations of the women in this second case. Sure, it explains that women and the judicial system can be lousy at understanding male consent, but it doesn't actually explain why men are being sexually propositioned at such a rate that when women are sexually assaulting them when they say no, it's at a rate comparable to men victimizing women.

Your first example of rape culture is that men are so focused on their sexual attraction to women that they are less incentivized to prioritize the other party's consent.

For rates of rape and sexual victimization to be close (in spite of the stereotype), a similar behavioral model has to be present in women. You're not actually getting better resolution at solving the problem for everyone if you're insisting on a gendered distinction for behavior, that's largely incomplete for women. 

It just seems like a way to circle back and explain why male victimization of women is the less extenuating case, because the motivations of the victimizing behavior are relatively more sinister.

2771,JakeDC,"This is true.  But /u/SchpittleSchpattle is kinda onto something.

Conviction for the *overwhelming majority* of crimes has a mental component in addition to the physical act.   For example, involuntary manalaughter requires negligence or criminal recklessness.  Without the requisite mental state, no crime has been committed.

Statutory rape, by contrast, is a strict liability crime, which means that conviction does not depend on mental state in any way.  The act itself is enough.  There are only a handful of strict liability crimes.  Most are small infractions/misdemeanors.  Statutory rape, of course, is a serious felony.  That makes it unique among strict liability crimes.  

Personally, I think the idea of convicting someone of a serious felony, and taking their liberty away, in the absence of a mental state requirement, is incredibly problematic from a moral perspective."
2772,SchpittleSchpattle,"AH, yeah you're right about the saying, thanks for jogging my memory on it. 

However, I will add that sure, you can still get convicted of a crime that you didn't intend to commit but if you can prove that your intent was not to break said law you generally get a drastically reduced sentence(or completely different conviction). An easy example would be sentences against someone convicted of Involuntary Manslaughter versus First Degree Murder.

Unfortunately, statutory rape has pretty clear cut guidelines and people get convicted even when the girl or her parents don't want to press charges *and* the girl admitted to lying about her age. Is that justice? I don't think so."
2773,triplehelix_,your example of manslaughter is a perfect example of intents place in the criminal justice system.  the primary difference between manslaughter and a murder is intent.
2774,fosterco,"That's a hard legal distinction to make.  Maybe it requires some affirmative evidence that the offender thought the victim was of age, even the victim just saying so.  If you ask someone if they are 18 (or whatever) and they say yes, why should you be legally accountable?  But that's why the age limit is in there, because there is the belief that at a certain age (like 13) a belief that the victim was 18 is not credible."

In the case of these laws, I think it's society saying ""Yes, there's probably some cases where an 18 year old dating a 14 year old is okay, but it's probably better to just avoid such relationships in order to protect the people who might be manipulated or exploited.""

It's similar reasoning to speed limit laws. Sure, your sportscar with a 12 liter engine and tires that can grip butter, but for many people, being allowed to drive at 120 mph will get people killed. So we put the law in the middle ground where most people will be able to operate safely and risk is reduced to reasonable levels. 

This probably makes a case against strict liability, so maybe I'm on your side on this argument. "

With criminal law, you could say that mental state 5/10 of the law :-)"
2828,JakeDC,"> mens rea can be stretched pretty thin. 

The issue here is not stretching mens rea thin.  Mens rea has been completely eliminated.  That is how strict liability works.  It isnt that the mental state requirement is really, really low.  It is that mental state is completely irrelevant.  It is not an element of the crime.  Period, full stop.

> As long as you meant to perform the action that is considered a crime, in my places that can be considered a crime.

This isn't quite accurate vis-a-vis criminal law.  Under the Model Penal Code, the lowest mens rea level is negligence.  While the MPC is not the law, conviction under most criminal statutes requires at least negligence as to the consequences or nature of the act, not merely an intent to commit the act.  What you are saying is true often in tort contexts, but not the criminal law.

> You also have to include that ignorance is not a defense (ignornantia juris non excusat if you want to stay latiny). 

This principle is about ignorance about the *law.*  It applies if a defendant is not challenging a finding that he meets the actus reus and mens rea components of the statute, and is arguing that he should still be excused because he did not know the action in question was illegal.  It does not apply when ignorance/mistake of *fact* are at issue.  Those questions go to mens rea.

> ""US v Kantor"" started to set up a defense via mistake of fact, but it only made it to the ninth circuit court.

Edited:

~~That is a tough nut to crack, because it basically involves judges adding a requirement to the statute that isn't there, contrary to legislative intent.~~

*U.S. v. Kantor* did introduce a limited ""good faith"" defense, but it only applies when the purported victim intentionally tricked the defendant into believing he/she was of age.  This defense has been adopted in othet jurisdictions (notwithstanding the fact that the case did not go to the Supreme Court), but it is quite limited.  

Note that this is an affirmative defense which means that, as a matter of law, it does not alter the mens rea requirement in the statute, but instead mitigates or defeats the legal consequences of meeting the elements of the criminal statute in certain cases.  This is a subtle, but important, distinction.  Basically, it acts as a justification for having broken the law, not as an argument that the law was not broken.
"
2829,Boukish,"> You're talking about ""mens rea"", or ""the guilty mind"".

Well no, he's talking about the mental component of crimes. Mens rea is one of them, but negligence and recklessness (the two things he actually said in his comment) are not mens rea."

2831,mwobuddy,"If its rape, then we should be sending juveniles to prison and giving them life on sex offender lists for sex with their boyfriends and girlfriends (you should note that females who are underage are conspicuously wholly absent from charges of age of consent violation in strict age states, whereas males are overwhelmingly on it, even if the males are underage).

If its rape solely because of the existence of the law, then a 17 year old is a rape victim, of equivalent status to a drugged and abused woman, or to a woman forcibly fucked in an alley at knife point, in Florida... however... In Nevada, they are not a rape victim.

See, I think of rape victims as people who've been greatly traumatized and physically and emotionally violated. This, to me, exists outside any laws. If rape laws were repealed tomorrow, I think people could still be victims of rape.

To say age of consent violation is rape is to say that the repealing of the age of consent law tomorrow, or merely it being lowered to something below the supposed victim's age, would suddenly make it no longer rape.

This is the implicit logic of saying that age of consent violations are rape. So a 17 year old in Florida is on equal status as victim as a woman who was drugged, but a 17 year old in Nevada is not of equal status.

This sounds like a huge trivialization of rape.

The implicit logic says that one underage person who has sex with another underage person is committing rape, and rape is supposedly a horrible crime. But in age-exemption states, it becomes allowed.

This sounds like a huge trivialization of rape.

It is not rape because it is clearly not related to rape laws which do not age discriminate, and age exemption states allow it to happen anyway. If it was rape, it'd be taken much more seriously. It would be a human rights violation to allow states to get away with age of consent at 16. It would be a human rights violation to create age-exemption laws and allow juveniles to get away with raping their current casual lay or their long term boyfriend/girlfriend.

She'd abuse me all the time and think it was hilarious, and when I would tell her to stop she would call me a pussy. It started with just punches to the arm and it slowly graduated to slaps in the face just for her amusement. 

One Sunday, we were laying around and she said 'hey, let's go to Best Buy so I can get a cd.' (I know, I'm old as fuck). And I told her no, I didn't feel like it because the Best Buy was 30 minutes away. After about 20-30 minutes of whining and complaining I gave in. We were in my car riding there, when she said, 'why are you being an asshole?' To which I replied 'how? I haven't even said anything.' Which was true because the whole car ride I was silent. 

She then said 'just stop being an asshole.' And then I gave her a mockingly 'okay!' And then she punched me in my right cheek. Closed fist punch to the face while I was driving down the highway. I had enough. I pulled onto the shoulder and I grabbed her thigh and I told her to never fucking do that ever again. And then she told me to stop being a fucking pussy. 

I threw my car back into drive and made u-turn and went back to her house. When we got in front of her house I put the car in park and said 'get out of my car.' And then she turned on the cutesy sweet girl act like she always did and the I yelled 'GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY CAR YOU CUNT'

She slapped me in the face again. I then got out of the car and started to walk to the passenger door. I was so mad I was going to rip her out of the car. She got out quickly and then I just turned back, got back into my car and sped off.

The next day I went over to her house to get my things while she was at work. I never talked to her again. 

I actually saw her a few years ago while I was hopping around the local bars when I was home visiting my parents for a long weekend. She was with some younger guy and she put on about 75lbs. It felt good to see her looking like a mess, but I felt bad for her new boyfriend. "

special shout-out to all the girls that can hold their booze with class"
2865,,"I've posted this a few times, but it fits here.

My ex girlfriend dumped me a year ago (with a text message, a week before Christmas). I was with my ex girlfriend for almost 3 years when it ended. We talked and planned about; marriage, kids and spending the rest of our lives together. Hell, I was a week away from asking her to marry me when she left. I tried so hard to save my relationship. 

I became extremely dependent on her. She was my best friend. I trusted her completely and I never questioned her. She was everything to me. The reason I got up in the morning. The reason I went to the gym. She gave me a purpose. No matter what happened to me, I knew I was going to be OK because I had her by my side. I cannot put into words how much I loved her or how important she was to me. I put her needs in front of everything else in my life. I would've moved heaven and earth for her. When she left, I didn't know who I was anymore. 

I didn't see it at the time, but she treated me terribly. She was horribly emotionally and mentally abusive to me. The entire relationship was on her terms and I was basically her boyfriend when it was convenient for her or she needed something (ie: emotional support, sometimes I felt like her therapist). After she left me (she said that I was the one abusing her. I believed her and went to get help. I didn't want to be a man who abuses the ones he loves. I quickly found out that I was the one being abused) I found out that she had been cheating on me for months. On top of that, I found out that pretty much everything that she ever told me was a lie and that I never really knew the real her. It's a strange and awful feeling to realize that the person you fell in love with, the person you truly believed was your soul mate was never real.

I know I'm much better off without her. When I told her that I'd never talk to her or see her again, she said ""What the hell? But you're my best friend! I need you in my life! You promised that no matter what happened, you'd always be there for me"". When I told her that it would just be to painful for me, that I couldn't go from being a week away from asking her to marry me to being just friends, she told me that wasn't normal and just another reason why she had to leave me. I know now that she has an extremely bad personality disorder (Borderline Personality Disorder/Sociopath). But...I still miss her. I still want her. There's still a part of me that believes we were meant to be together. I know that was never real, that it was part of her personality disorder but it's incredibly difficult to separate that. It hurts so much to tell my story and have people say ""wow, I never would've left you"" or ""she'll never find a guy who will treat her as well as you did"". Or to have your therapist say ""you are absolutely marriage material and you're going to make some woman extremely happy one day"". It hurts because it just leads me to think ""Why? Why, if I'm so great. If I treated her so well...why did she leave me? Why did she hurt me so much?""

It's been a year now. I'm still single and I just turned 30. I'm terrified I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life alone. I'm terrified I'm never going to find someone I'll love as much or want to spend the rest of my life as much as I did with her. I'm slowly (with the help of therapy) rebuilding myself. I'm slowly starting to feel like my old self again. But, when someone is involved with ever aspect of your life, a lot reminds you of them. I still find myself going ""Huh, I wish I could tell/show her this or that"" or ""I bet she'd find this funny"".

I've learned that emotional and mental abuse...is odd. Odd is the best way I can describe it. It's like being trapped in our my head. I know that xyz is not true and I have overwhelming proof that xyz is not true. But there's this voice, her voice telling me that we're wrong. That xyz is true and that I'm a horrible person and a monster. 

My ex convinced me I was a monster. She convinced me that I was not only solely responsible for the death of our relationship, I was responsible for everything wrong in her life. Her depression, anxiety, social troubles (she had a very hard time making and keeping friends. At the time I could never understand why. I figured she was misunderstood), school trouble...everything was because of me. She said that I had sexually assaulted her. She said I was mentally and emotionally abusing her. She said I was controlling her by keeping her from seeing her friends and family (nothing could be further from the truth. I hardly saw her. I didn't want her to be forced to see me, if that makes sense. I believed her when she said she really wanted to see me but she was busy. She was always busy. I felt forgotten. When I told her this she said ""I don't forget about you. I'm just busy and I had my entire life to see you!"" The last year we were together, we only saw each other 30 times. The rest was text and phone calls). She refused to even see me in person because ""she was afraid of what her reaction would be if I tried to comfort her and that she no longer felt safe around me"". She threatened to beat the shit out of me and told me that it would be my fault because I had the audacity to ask one of her few friends if he was dating her (the same guy she was cheating on me with). She said that I had left her no other choice but to leave me and told me ""I hope you learn from this because this is all your fault. You took something that was once so beautiful and turned it into something ugly and painful"". And I believed every single word she said.

I was beyond crushed. I almost killed myself that night. I couldn't even stomach my own reflection in the mirror. For months I cried every single day. Then she tormented me by making sure it got back to me how happy she was or how she has a new boyfriend. My depression got so bad I had my local Crisis and Suicide Prevention line calling me every day to check on me.

The road has been very long but I have gotten better over the past year. I haven't cried for a few months now and that's a good thing. She no longer consumes my ever thought, but she's still very present in my mind because of the hole she left both in me and my life. People tell me that I'll find someone far better than her but if I'm being honest, I don't know if I believe that. After all, I really thought she was my soul mate. How do you find that again?

The scary part is, being completely honest...if she were to try to come back, I'm not sure if I'd say ""No"".

I didn't just loose a girlfriend. I lost my best friend. I lost my future wife. I lost the mother of my children. I lost my partner who I couldn't wait to share the rest of my life with. Above all else I lost my future, something I am slowly starting to get back, even if I have a hard time believing that.

Well...that's my horrible breakup. I just wanted to share what I went through."

2874,dirkdeagler,"I just recently broke up with my girlfriend after having close friends and family make it clear to me that her controlling behavior was abuse.  I guess it had been going on for a while, but given the way we're conditioned as men growing up, I just couldn't conceive of myself as the man in the relationship being the subject for abuse.  

That changed the other night when she went into another of her jealous rages (ironic because I've never been anything but 100% faithful in our relationship) and demanded to see my phone.  I had let her see my phone in the past to prove that I wasn't maintaining relationships with any other women, which was a huge mistake and even though the content of my phone showed I wasn't unfaithful, she seized on a small inconsistency in my story (which I honestly just remembered incorrectly) and still put me through the ringer of emotional abuse.  On the night in question, I told her that looking at my phone is a boundary, and it wouldn't be happening any more.  She pressed the issue, and I told her that if she really felt like she wasn't going to be satisfied until she looked at my phone, then she needed to leave and cool off.  She ripped my phone out of my hands, and walked out the door.  I can't do anything to grab it back because I risk hurting her and being on the wrong side of Johnny Law's interpretation of events.

An hour later, she's back, pounding on my door.  I'm pretty pissed at this point, so I crack the door and tell we can talk, but she needs to stay outside.  She jams her knee between the door frame and door, and starts to push into it with her whole body weight.  This is a totally shitty situation for me.  We do powerlifting together, and while I'm undoubtedly a lot stronger than she is, she's by no means weak.  In order for me to keep her out of my house, I risk physically hurting her by virtue of the force I'd need to exert to push her back.  So at this point, not only have I had my phone taken, I've had her enter my house against my explicit instructions to her that she's not welcome inside.  She throws my phone down on the floor and informs me that she deleted it.  (Actually, she tried to enter the PIN incorrectly so many times it auto-wiped.)  I lose a 10-year career worth of contacts in advertising that I didn't have backed up, along with all the photos and videos that aren't backed up on a cloud service.  

In the meantime, she continues to yell at me about how I've somehow lied to her.  I tell her she needs to leave my house, and she refuses to leave.  Fine, I tell her, she needs to sleep on the couch then.  She refuses that.  I'm pissed, but I feel that calling the cops is more risk than reward, despite the fact that I've done nothing wrong.  We settle into an uneasy truce where she's asleep in my bed and I'm just totally ignoring her.  Thankfully, I was able to wake her up the next morning and tell her she had 5 minutes to get out, and I think at that point she'd cooled down enough to have at least a modicum of remorse and leave.

It sucks because even though this really was a breaking point for me, I still have compassion for her and why she has such terrible trust issues.  I dunno if that makes me a ""cuck"" or whatever, but I still struggle with feeling like I'm somehow letting her down because I know how bad she had it as a child, and I feel like if I could somehow just be better I'd be capable of helping her.  In the end though, I realize that trying to do that from within a relationship with her is just going to perpetuate the problem and run me absolutely ragged, and that ultimately she needs professional help.  

I never thought that myself, as a man, would be in this kind of situation.  I thought abusive relationships were shit that happened to other people, and they were idiots for not just walking away.  I'm just glad I had support from people who had my best interests in heart and gave it to me straight about what was going on."

My uncle married a woman who used to kick the shit out of him all the time. There was one fight that was getting out of control, so he just went ahead and called the police and she hit herself in the face with a beer bottle so the cops would haul him off.

It all came to a breaking point with their last fight when she grabbed and twisted his balls so hard he ended up in the hospital for three days.

I really hate that even these days, many men are brought up with the ancient concept of chivalry, that you never hit a woman, ever, even if you are defending yourself. The idea is beyond absurd and shows there's still a ton of gender bias alive and well.

A few years ago I was at a local bar and this lady flipped out when I refused to buy her a drink, she tried to knee me in the groin, barely missed. So I punched her in the throat, laid her out and left. I still get shit from my friends about that. But I bet that asshole at the bar thinks twice before assulting men now."

2905,400yards,"I was a victim of abuse at the hands of my now Ex-wife. During our ridiculous long break up. There was much abuse thrown back and forth. But, I found **two** things that were especially egregious, and really things that she got away with mainly because of her sex.
  
-Having a woman you love try to beat you, is in fact devastating. Even when she is a foot and an inch shorter and less than a third of my weight (always were total opposites sizewise). She also, had little muscle tone, and I was jacked. It was like trying to knock down a wall with a wet noodle. I remember having a cop almost beg me to just say it once, ""She hit me"". He was tired of seeing my house. She was always the one to call. Cop promised I will probably never have to go through it again. She was lashing out in way she thought she could totally get away with at anytime. He was sure she would be convinced otherwise fairly quickly. I had no desire to have the mother of my children in cuffs. Will always wonder if I just extended the pain.
  
-Worse than my Ex's ineffectual ""beatings"", was an all too common form of abuse, that is simply **NEVER** mentioned. Someone please tell me if this behavior has a name. When her rage was peaking, and her self control was a little in check, she would do something very consistent and specific. It happened most often to me when I was trying to disengage from an argument in any way. What she would do, what many people sometimes do, is: **Try to manipulate me to engage in an argument I want no part of. Specifically, it was very clear she wanted me to do something inappropriate**. Preferably she wanted me to be violent. Her words and actions were meant to illicit a fright or flight response, she would save the cruelest and most tasteless tactics. In my experience, I would immediately try to just get away, jump in the car and decide were I'm going once I was a block away. She would physically block doorways, all of them. The closet to get shoes, the bathroom so I could pee, the front door, and finally the car door. I usually escaped unscathed. Thankfully, my therapist saw fit to prepare me in case I should encounter this behavior. I can proudly state that I never gave her what she wanted. Best advise I ever got was to keep my hands deep in my pockets at all times. How I managed not to break down and give in to my base and almost natural instincts is something I'm actually proud of. I'm not saying that NOT being abusive is a cause for celebration. It is a mere expectation of civility, humanity, and law. There is no way for a **man** to win these situations. The only small victory is in self control.  

TL;DR: Women will sometimes try to force a man to be violent or inappropriate. An almost impossible situation for any man. Much too common. Woman behaves badly, her man is the one tested and put at risk. "
2906,azazelcrowley,"(I should add, this is the capstone of months of verbal abuse, gradually grinding me down. 5 minute sudden shouting matches here and there, eventually, this happened. By this point i'm already a bit of a wreck tbh)

My ex partner was blocking the exit to the house by blocking the stairs and screaming at me for about twenty minutes about how she hates everything about me and basically just wanting to demolish my self-esteem, the insults were incoherent when taken together, but drove the same point in over and over. 
Couldn't get past her obviously, because that'd be physical.

She'd say I was too arrogant and too insecure, as an example. Just a constant scream of what amounts to ""I hate you.""
""You're a slob"" ""You care too much about your appearance you vain fuck"" etc.

Eventually this devolved into death threats and how I should die, how my mother should have killed me, that she was gonna shove me down the stairs, stuff like that.

Eventually she got out of the way, and I immediately took a break for it.
Shoulda paid attention.

She ran and shoved me in the direction of the stairs. 

Doesn't matter that it didn't work, for a second, I really thought it might.
My brain snapped and I became more like a frightened animal.
I clawed at her face and punched her, shoved her into the wall, and ran away, almost fell down the fucking stairs anyway from scurrying.

I curled up in as a ball in an alley and called the police to explain what happened. I think I was still snapped in the brain, because it took like an hour for me to calm down enough for them to understand my rambling. Apparently I was completely incoherent at first and gradually calmed down from the operator being nice to me. She stayed on the phone and talked to me while the cops traced it. Probably heard I was terrified.

She denied none of it. The police filed one report, which we both signed, because it was the truth.
Was still me taken to a cell for the night. 

Nothing happened to her.

I'm pretty sure She tried to kill me, and nothing happened to her.

When I got back, she'd trashed the place. It was my home.
*shrug*

Maybe I coulda kept it together from the physical attack without the big attempt to demolish my mind and wear me down first, maybe not.

I dunno what happened to me. Nothing really crossed my mind. I just remember blind panic and my physical actions, the occurrence of events. Conscious kind of thought wasn't there.

I will never call the police again. No male should when dealing with a woman.

Don't give me the crap about it being women being small. Anyone can understand how what she did was dangerous to me. It's not that. It's that society refuses to hold women accountable for anything, ever. 

I felt pathetic for my breakdown. I felt embarrassed to be seen like that. I'm embarrassed even talking about it.

I think what triggered it is she managed to convey such spite and malice and hatred and such wish of harm on me, that as soon as I realized it wasn't just talk, but that she was willing to physically try to enact it? I just snapped and went into fight/flight. Like, her malice and contempt for me sort of loomed over me and when she shoved me I didn't feel big. I felt really small, and frightened. That's the kind of sense I got. Its stupid. I dunno. I guess if you try and break someone mentally they might break mentally in unpredictable ways. Maybe i'll never understand it.

If she'd pressed charges, I probably would have gone to jail I think. She had blood on her face from me clawing at her and punching her, and the wall had busted a bit.

I probably could have killed her.

She didn't press charges because she didn't want me to either. But I couldn't risk it. If the cops saw fit to take me away instead of her, i'm pretty sure i'd be the one in court. I don't think she figured out she could have done it.

""Worst"" part?
The cops were pretty clearly sympathizing more with me. When they said they needed to seperate us for the night, the cop who said it, he broke eye contact with me.

He knew. he knew it was unfair and he did it anyway.
That's one of the things that really sticks with me about that day. It felt like I had been betrayed as well as everything else.
I could have handled him being a bigot. But that really got to me.

She was a cunt, but i've moved on. But that cop deciding to knowingly fuck me over still gets to me. Stupid I guess.

When I saw her a few times after that, despite her clearly ""Losing"" that fight in terms of physical injury, I was scared  of her. She wasn't of me. Didn't act it anyway. Couldn't help it. Just saw her, and fwoompf. Brain starts getting itchy to leave. Everything becomes sharper focused, stuff like that. Pretty sure she gave me PTSD."

2911,,"
This still gets to me, even decades later.

After the abuse I suffered at the hands of both genders in my youth, learning how hardly anybody gives a damn about, or would rather minimize, the psychological blows dealt at the hands of girls to me, it opened my eyes to just how uncaring this world can be.

Some people have told me ""But we DO teach both genders not to hit each other in school"".  I always end up asking ""How come girls continue to get the idea that boys are fair game to treat as physical and emotional punching bags as they grow older?""

Another question I'd tack on is ""How come in enteratainment, creators think a strong, female protagonist means they have to always be right and the male characters always wrong, possess no flaws whatsoever, and are given free reign to emotionally and physically assault a male character for no reason except for either saying the wrong thing or making a mistake?""

Mainly due to years and year and years of shows like oprah showing men are bad men are evil. Its not womens fault if women were really nice and kind to you all your life but you have a show like Oprah showing women are bad look at all the stuff they are doing, it would have an impact on you too.

Eg: finding crazy religous people, crazy ""sjws"" and instead of just being this person is crazy and ignoring them they are on national tv, and full circle back to the other side with ""anti sjws"" that are doing their own cringie childish stupid things.

The other day my husband told me about his friend and his new wife. They got in fights all the time and got married pretty much for military benefits. He said they got physical a lot but neither of them ever called the cops. She once threw a remote at his face and cut him so he had to get stitches. I hadn't seen him after that so I had no idea. Anyway, neither of them call the cops on each other and by the way he talks to my husband it's like he thinks the way they act towards each other is normal.

2984,im_a_real_asshole,"Your story brings back unpleasant memories of a very similar situation. My fiance at the time had grown to hitting/throwing/pushing/etc once yelling wasn't enough. 

Once I told her, ""If you don't stop, I'm going to call the cops."" She proceeded to call 911 and then hang up. When the cops showed up, all I could think was ""great, I'm going to end up being the one going to jail because all she has to do is lie."" Thank god she didn't.

The most I really did was to push her away or hold her down so she would stop hitting. While she was happy to inflict pain, I never wanted to. One time, in frustration of being pummeled, I pushed her hard enough that she flew over the bed and broke a window. I regretted instantly because I didn't want to hurt her, just get her away. What I regretted most was the one time I punched her in the shoulder (not even that hard) -- again, in the heat of being absolutely pummeled. It's amazing how you can feel so bad for basically defending yourself during abuse.

The fact that police/courts/etc don't recognize that women can be just as much the abuser as men is ridiculous. A woman can simply claim it happened and the guy goes to jail, while a guy has to have a ridiculous amount of proof and it is still unlikely that anything will happen to her."
2985,SoTheyDontFindOut,"Never feel silly about therapy. It has a stigma but honestly who is gonna know you go to therapy unless you tell them?  Therapy is very helpful, you were in a physically abusive relationship that can also affect you emotionally. Men don't get treated the same by society when they are the one being abused compared to a woman. This doesn't mean you aren't just as affected as any other person who was physically abused. You have every right to want to talk to someone about it and it is very understandable. I'm glad you got out of it tho, my friend was physically abused by his girlfriend in front of me and I called her ass out and told her to stop. It hurt seeing that look on his face and in his eyes.

But it's socially acceptable to show a controlling and possessive woman and no one bats an eye. In this commercial the family appeared to have kids so that does make it more of a mutual decision;  when one spouse leaves to go hangout, he or she leaves the other with the sole burden of supervising the children, but still, this double standard is embedded throughout our culture.  A lot of female characters are depicted as downright emotionally abusive towards their mates but no one really talks about it...it's portrayed as acceptable.  So is that an unfair depiction of women and hurtful towards women? Yeah probably. But is it also hurtful in that it kind of sets an unacceptable standard of behavior."

No, it isn't.

People SEE what they want to see, and the view it within a context that they have been TRAINED to view it.  And when they SEE a woman actually attacking a man with physical violence they do **NOT** ""see"" it as ""assault"" instead they are programmed to ""view"" it as FUNNY, i.e. harmless ""slapstick"" comedy stuff.

However I came to the realization that girls aren't really that special, you find one girl and you put her on a pedestal and think she is the best in the world. She loses attraction to you because of how needy you are, and then you go into a cycle of self-loathing. Be happy with yourself, and focus only on yourself.

What does need to be said is that those scenes in movies where a girl meets a guy at a bar, he says something offensive, then she slaps him; that's not ok. But even that is being seen by most women nowadays as wrong. "
3018,slfnflctd,"The emotional abuse is a big one.  Many women (more so those who have been abused themselves, of course), in my direct experience, have zero qualms about using demeaning, shaming, invalidating, belittling language - up to and including very hurtful direct insults - when a disagreement isn't going their way.

A woman I'm very close to just pulled out every attack she could think of on me a couple days ago (among other things, totally invalidating serious mental heath issues I've suffered all my adult life that once led to a full-on suicide attempt, which she knows about) out of nowhere during an argument about *food*.  I forgive her and still love her, but it completely fucked me up for the rest of the day and I am certain down to my bones that it was deeply wrong.  Unfortunately, I don't know if she'll ever understand this - her father was very abusive, and while I know that's not an excuse, it does tend to lead to blind spots in these areas - and since it doesn't make sense to me to confront it right now for fear of making things worse, I'm letting it go.  Sound familiar?

I have had a number of women do this to me over the years.  Progressive, empowered women who defy norms and champion the downtrodden.  Strong advocates of science and evidence-based decision making (such as the thoroughly demonstrated fact that emotionally abusive, escalating language has more negative than positive effects, unless in jest).  Who then turn around and act like this toward people they supposedly care about.

I'm glad you included the last sentence in your comment, though.  I'm pretty sure we can all agree on that.

Edit:  I feel compelled to add that I don't agree with a lot things being said in this thread, and am of the opinion that the ""Men's Rights"" movement, however well intentioned, has been compromised by the alt-right.  I hope everyone can realize at some point that this doesn't mean they haven't brought some important issues to light."
3019,MrPlaysWithSquirrels,"Many abusers will say they agree with this as well. But they don't view it as abuse when they constantly emotionally belittle the man, telling them they are weak, that they shouldn't cry, or to grow up. Those things don't register as emotional abuse. Or when she ""just slapped him that one time, and he deserved it!"" Those things don't register as abuse to them and we need to continue reinforcing that it *is* abuse. It's an education campaign, not a blaming campaign. That's how I see it, at least."
3020,know_comment,"the problem is communication.  when people are frustrated, the want to take their frustration out on the source.  and women want to be acknowledged for their frustration.  But they'll often use passive aggression rather than physical violence because it's a more effective tool for them. If that isn't getting through, it might escalate.  For instance, if you're getting the silent treatment, ask what's wrong and she says ""nothing""- she probably wants you to figure out what's wrong and acknowledge it (unless it's just a moody/ hormonal thing).  If you DON'T, there's a good chance she's going to escalate somehow to let you know that there's a problem.  Maybe she'll accidentally destroy something of yours, or maybe she'll find another way to egg you into a confrontation.

That's the bottom line- people get frustrated and want acknowledgement for their feelings.  A guy doesn't beat his wife out of nowhere, unless he's a sadistic sociopath.  Maybe she slept with his bestfriend.  Maybe he's an alcoholic who feels like his life is out of control and he takes it out on her.  Maybe he was abused by his mother and has problems reconciling it in his relationships.  The same goes for a girl- she isn't hitting him or belittling him for shits and giggles. She has an emotional problem and doesn't know how to peacefully communicate and resolve it."
3021,StarsDie,"Had I, a much smaller and less muscular and less athletic guy than Ray were slapping him and spitting at him, he would have knocked me unconscious and probably would have curb-stomped me into a coma; and it would be viewed as a fair retaliation. He gave Janay a punch that if he were to reveal his force in a percentage, I'd guess he would probably say anywhere between 40%-70% strength was behind it. No long-term physical issues as far as we know, and in fact from everything we know -- part of her lack of consciousness came from having been drinking and having accidentally hit her head on her way down.

That means that men should get equal treatment in child custody cases (where I believe they are often discriminated against).

They need to be handled like children, especially if you're going to live with them. Women don't begin to mature beyond the high school mentality until they're in their late 30s and their partner options begin to shrink. 


Women have the luxury of being able to easily attract male partners, they can behave how they'd like because they know they can always find someone as good as you or better. The best thing you can do is work on your body; lift, eat clean. If you receive female attention your partner will pick up on it and realize that you have options and she will try harder to keep you interested."

Probably this kind of answer can be seen (and can be deliverd) as a huge agree and amplify answer, but...  never forget that this female accusation is ( at least to me) the ultimate red flag.

Anyway, she squeezed my arm and dug her nails in. My instinctive reaction was to push her off. She went into a bush and had to be pulled out.  
I thought I would get shit for it, but actually got no punishment when they saw the claw marks. It was surprising to me and everyone who saw it- that's the disgusting part, everybody assumed I would get in trouble because I was the boy in the situation.

So are there social issues that need solving in order to make life better for everyone, Men, Women and anyone in between included? Yes.

3108,AmoralNiceGuy,"Gonna have to shoot you down here (and agree with u/dingoperson2).  Being able to absorb kinetic shock with less damage has little to do with the amount of pain felt.  In fact, there is a growing body of research that the level of pain due to a given stimulus has little to do with the amount of actual damage caused.  The level of pain actually has much more to do with the emotions surrounding the event and the PERCEIVED/EXPECTED level of [damage/future disability].  This means that emotionally charged damage (such as abuse from someone they love, or an attack from a thing they have a phobia about like snakes or spiders) or a higher than normal fear of personal damage can actually make pain more intense (like being attacked by a group that just happens to include women).

Additionally, research has found that men (at least report) higher levels of pain for similar stimuli if dysfunction due to the source of pain is possible.  This likely stems from the absolute need for men (historically, though it is changing now) to remain functional to continue being the bread winner (or be considered worthless by society).  This creates a lot of stress around pain and injury for men.  

Lastly, nociception (the neurological sensing of potentially damaging forces in the body) is carried out by nocioreceptors, a specialized form of nerve.  The vast majority of those kinds of nerves are in the skin and muscles close to the surface for what is believed evolutionary reasons (better, faster response to attack).  So just because someone is not ACTUALLY taking damage, doesn't mean that it is not just as painful.  Take, for instance, a slap vs. a punch.  Slaps can hurt WAY more than a punch, but almost exclusively do less damage.  This is due to the fact the far more nocioreceptors are activated by a slap than a punch.

Sure, if a man thinks that a woman could never physically hurt them and are not emotionally connected to the woman, then they will likely feel less pain, but that isn't always the case (assuming all other things are equal... like she isn't in a group of people that look like they are looking for a fight).

Conscription?   There's no way any society will allow their women to die en masse in wars.   That's not the way human beings work.

That article has some great points too, specifically pointing out that men are more likely to commit suicide, and men and women are almost equally at risk for domestic abuse.

Feminists might protest a co-ed shelter, where all domestic abuse victims live in one area. I wouldn't blame them, it could be traumatic for both males and females if they are trying to recover from domestic abuse. No one should condone violence, male or female. I think we agree here. There's a ton of lacking support for males shelters because men are less likely to report domestic abuse. Men are taught to deal with it, ignore their feelings, and ""be a man"" about it. Getting hit by your wife/girlfriend/partner is seen as weak. Feminists want to change that, not encourage that dumb gender role. "
3137,yourfacelikesme,">Too bad they support the duluth model (basically arrest the man no matter what at a domestic abuse call) and actively fight the opening of male victims shelters or deny the reality of domestic violence being equal.

As an avid feminist, I had to look up the Duluth model. To me, this suggests it lacks merit within intersectionality feminism. After a bit of research, it's deeper than ""basically arrest the man no matter what at a domestic abuse call""; it's more of an assumption that men are more likely to be violent attackers and does not consider the motive behind the violent attack beyond. This is sexist, placing on gender in one norm without considering other life factors, and this is not what intersectional feminism would preach. Feminists who believe in the Duluth model are sexist and hence by definition are not feminists.

Men should have equal access to victim shelters. Men are also not as likely to report domestic abuse and women are less likely to be taken to court in a male/female couple where the female is the abuser. Feminists who understand and practice intersectionality understand this."

I want to add something to your points. *Note that when I say ""you,"" I don't mean you specifically, but all men as a generalization.*

It's important at all times to reserve the option to yourself to leave the relationship flat out, without looking back. It's important to keep in your mind, and remind *yourself* if you have to, that you have that option (and ability). If you stay time and time again after she throws fit after fit, she probably can't learn, and you'll end up wasting your time and energy on a lost cause. You have to be prepared to walk out, no questions asked. 

It will benefit you in multiple ways, just as a bonus to handling the situation well. First, it'll train you to be able to separate your own emotions from her attempts at emotional manipulation. It'll also help reinforce the fact that you don't have to put up with a girl who behaves shittily.

OP defined the woman who he was talking about were the kind of woman who hit and such. This is a subset of all woman. When he says ""they"" everyone knows that's who he is talking about. Trying to move it down to talking as if they are just individualises minimises the problem and makes it have less impact.

3209,caffeinated_panda,"From dictionary.com:

>Feminism, noun
1. the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men.
2. (sometimes initial capital letter) an organized movement for the attainment of such rights for women.

This is what feminism means. No individual or organization speaks for all feminists; we are not a monolith any more than, say, all Christians. I'm not going to list examples of legal discrimination against women; I will simply say that we should work to change discriminatory laws of any kind, regardless of who they target.

[While this one is somewhat a different subject, it was a protest in toronto of an event that would have talked about the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iARHCxAMAO0)

I also suggest that you consider looking into former feminist Erin Pizzey, who was the subject of death threats, bomb threats, & harrassment, after coming out publicly with her research that women committed far higher rates of domestic violence than previously thought. She too was also in favor of men's shelters.

[Here is an article that has some excerpts from her AMA a while ago](http://womenspost.ca/owner-of-shelter-for-abused-men-and-children-commits-suicide-after-financial-ruin-ridicule/) where she talked about Earl Silverman, the owner and founder of the only male's shelter in Canada, who ended up committing suicide after not being able to receive funding to keep the shelter open.

If memory serves, Pizzey was also supposed to take part in an event in Detroit a while back that was protested by various feminist groups. The event was eventually cancelled.

3235,DWShimoda,"> Or you get prosecuted for recording someone without their consent. Even if it were to prevent a crime, not knowing the law doesn't excuse you from breaking it. 

**BULLSHIT.** 

There is no (valid) law that criminalizes the recording of someone  engaged in a criminal act (nor really -- bar things like *child*-porn -- anyone engaged in any OTHER ""public"" activity).


--
Don't confuse & conflate things like ""wiretapping"" (recording of phone conversations, etc) or the various restraints on ""publishing"" with the **recording** of LIVE EVENTS to which you are a party/participant.

--
Beyond that, you are entirely free to **record** (photograph, audio, video) basically whatever you want (virtually your whole life with some ""body cam"" if you care to).

But that is an ENTIRELY different matter to POSTING audio/video or PUBLISHING photos or even private ""correspondence""\* (especially if done commercially or for profit, though that is NOT the only constraint\*\*) ""without prior consent"" -- but you need to comprehend that the ""prior"" in that is  *prior to ""publication"",* and NOT prior to the ""recording.""

The crime or ""damage"" (if any) is NOT in the act of taking the photograph, or making the video/audio recording (again ""live"" and in person) -- the crime or damage is in what you DO with it afterwards.

---
\* Private letters that you WRITE to other people are still YOUR property. Private letters that you RECEIVE from other people are NOT yours -- they are THEIR property -- i.e. you can freely publish YOUR side of any correspondence, but you cannot (legally) publish THEIR private letters or replies without THEIR explicit permission (if you do, they can sue). That said there ARE exceptions, which is one reason you see things like letters being called ""Open Letter To..."" that phrasing is taken as a *prima facie* declaration that the letter CAN be published (by anyone with a copy). 

--
\*\* Other constraints are things like ""defamation of character"" etc; though those are usually civil matters (i.e. lawsuits, etc) and not ""crimes"" per se -- and while ""truth"" is a *possible* defense, it is not necessarily sufficient by itself. (IOW the fact that some friend DID in fact ""make a complete fool of themselves"" in some private setting, does NOT mean you have the right to PUBLISH some record of that incident {written, photographic, video, etc} which would hold them up to ridicule, or unreasonably defame their character, damage their *public* image, etc.)"

3253,bufedad,"Different social experiments/actual statistical studies.

**Social Experiments**

When a woman is being aggressively yelled at, people jump to her defense and call the police (yelled at with an aggressive posture... like he might become violent, but hasn't).

When a man is being hit/punched/slapped, people stand around, laugh, and cheer her on.

This has been done repeatedly, but always has the same results.

**Studies**

When men report domestic abuse, they are more likely to be arrested than their abuser. 

About half of all domestic violence is reciprocal (both being violent to each other). 

Of the one sided domestic violence, 70% is woman on man domestic violence.

Of the violence in reciprocally violent relationships, women instigate the violence 80% of the time.

The largest predictor of whether a woman will be the victim of domestic violence in her relationship is **not whether her partner was violent in past relationhips**. The greatest predictor is **whether she was violent in past relationships**.

[NIH study on Domestic Violence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1854883/)

This is where I started recording the conversation (asked to call parents.) He made all three of us stand in the ran for 45 minutes while he waited for another Officer to arrive search my car with a drug dog for this supposed weed, made me take a breathalyzer and found nothing so proceeded to write me a reckless driving ticket for going 65 in a 35. I call the police department file a complaint about the Officer, talk to a public defender, he said it was illegal for me record the conversation we couldn't use it as evidence at all.

Think about it this way.

The thing most people fail to understand is that the vast majority of cops (particularly local ""town"" & ""city"" police\*) are largely CLUELESS about the vast majority of ""the law.""

--
They **aren't** ""attorneys""\*\* -- not by a long shot (the very idea is actually laughable) -- and generally speaking their training (and knowledge) is very VERY limited.

When it comes to ""the law"" what the vast majority of them ""know"" is an extremely LIMITED amount, generally related to the local town/city ""ordinances"" (and then a few other odd specific things like {of course} the state's traffic laws; ""domestic violence"" laws; and things around property crimes, breaking & entering, vandalism; possibly state/local firearm & drug enforcement laws, etc) -- basically **the things that they hand out tickets/citations for,** and which their department has a ""policy manual"" on which they've received *rudimentary (and fairly superficial) ""training"" on* (we're talking a couple of half-day ""summary/refresher"" sessions *maybe* once or twice a year or so {if even}; and majority of THAT training probably had to do with process/procedure, technicalities about properly filling out forms, using the new computer system, etc.)

Also keep in mind that while not exactly ""morons"" the general/average ""intelligence"" of the typical local police officer is... well it's ""average"" or ""mediocre"" (i.e. we're talking an aggregate average of IQ 100 at best, with a few *rare* exceptions being more than a few points higher, and quite a few being slightly below -- literally any ""randomized"" selection of the general population would have a higher IQ average than the typical local police officer -- no offense intended, but it's generally NOT the kind of job that attracts ""geniuses"" {and the more intelligent, better educated ones, well *if* they go into police work, it's generally into county, state, and/or federal work, not the local ""traffic cop"" or ""beat cop"").

--
Now, all that said, that obviously **doesn't** stop them from pretentiously and arrogantly ***BULLSHITTING*** people about their ""expertise"" and ""authority"" -- both of which are invariably a LOT lower/different than they not only claim (in which case often they ARE aware they are lying/bullshitting), but even than they *sincerely BELIEVE* (i.e. they're entirely mistaken about a LOT of things).

---
\* Generally speaking -- though again this varies -- the County Sheriff and/or Deputies are substantially more knowledgeable and/or better, more thoroughly trained; and State Police (i.e. ""Troopers"") are typically an order of magnitude higher yet.  But even THEY are nevertheless far from a ""definitive"" authority on the vast majority of ""the law""; as their training/education invariably focuses on and emphasizes (quite understandably) he kinds of things they are LIKELY to come into contact with on a daily or weekly, or even monthly, basis.  And of course again, a HUGE part of that training is ""policy & procedure"" (forms, processing, court systems, etc).

Point is that there is NO POINT in asking some police officer about say ""business contract law"" much less the nuances of ""intellectual property laws"" (i.e. copyright etc -- including ""publishing"" photos, videos, and so on) -- because they've almost certainly NEVER received any ""training"" in any of that at all (*possibly* -- presuming that they even went to college -- they might have had some part of a course in college that dealt with it in a superficial summary manner, but that was likely years and more ago, and it wasn't ""in depth"" and might not have even been ""current"" at the time that they took the class).

And even some of what they HAVE received training on ... well it wasn't necessarily entirely ""correct"" as it was presented, much less as they ""understood"" it.

---
\*\* And even THAT -- well even **attorney's** knowledge of ""the law"" is going to be limited, and probably specialized. The local lawyer that handles Real Estate stuff, the occasional (basic) ""will & testament"" stuff, possibly handles local misdemeanor and even the occasional felony charge... well, again they DID receive some ""overview/summary"" instruction regarding the overall laws and statutes and regulations of their state *back in the day* (years and possibly decades ago=) when they were in law school, and SINCE then, they *probably* learned a lot more about, and kept *reasonably* up-to-date *concerning things that they encounter in their regular practice.*  But said local attorney is probably NOT a very good source of information regarding anything else (no point in getting advice from that local ""criminal defense"" lawyer on how to obtain a ""patent"" on your invention, or copyright law or etc -- you'll learn far more (and far more up-to-date info) from some ""Patents & Copyrights for Dummies"" book; and then, if you have specific questions... well you need to go to an attorney that *specializes* in IP law, and probably one that has a *particular practice-focus* on the kind of IP you're dealing with (IOW some ""patent attorney"" who usually works with software companies on software copyrights/patents is probably NOT the best guy to help you with your new ""power wrench"" invention, he just doesn't know the ""art"" involved, and you're going to pay out the ass to have him learn {on YOUR time-billing}).

--
And while it *may seem a bit ""absurd"" to reference things like that (patents, copyrights)* -- well, the point is that **those things are actually a lot MORE COMMON for some local lawyer (to say nothing of local ""police officer"") -- than cases involving ""wiretapping"" & ""recording"" laws.** I'd be willing to bet you that out of 1,000 attorneys in any city or county, that, on average, probably not more than ONE of that 1,000 has ever (in their entire career & practice history) been *directly* involved in any case having to deal with ""wiretapping"" or ""surreptitious recording""; oh to be sure a few more of them MAY have given some ""general legal guidance"" to a client about recording phone conversations (especially around divorce, child custody & other ""family law"" cases), or possibly advised some local business owner a decade ago about where he can/cannot place surveillance cameras and/or microphones in his store (i.e. NOT in bathroom stalls; and that video is OK, but audio is generally NOT), yet IMO that really doesn't qualify as ""direct case experience."" (Those business owners could have gotten the same info from a book or online reference -- which is *probably* what those attorneys did -- it just gains the business owner a bit more ""good faith"" cover {and creates an ""officer of the court"" reference about the inquiry} if he actually consulted an attorney, which courts count far higher than ""I read a book."")

--
Law -- especially around THESE kinds of things (where it's not only contentious socially & ""politically,"" but where technology is changing rapidly) -- is a lot more complicated than people imagine. And on many issues -- again, especially those outside of an attorney's normal everyday ""practice"" area -- you could ask a dozen lawyers, get a good half-dozen entirely different ""opinions"" (especially if given verbally ""off the cuff/off the record"" and *without* diligent research) and yet NONE of that half-dozen may actually prove correct; you may as well ask a dozen bartenders their opinion (and ironically one of THEM might actually know more, LOL)."

3304,Jacobjs93,"I used to be where you are. I'm not comparing lives or saying it's easy but what I did was just let everything go. I argue with myself all the time internally.

I try to see reason in things (the most frustrating part is when there isn't reason) and understand that not everyone thinks or acts as I do. 

Comparison is the killer of joy. You will never be happy comparing others to yourself. This is with everything from relationships to careers. All that matters is that you do your best and are happy with your results.

There are plenty of men and women sitting in prison today who wish they could take back the 5 or 10minutes when they lost their shit and assaulted someone. It only takes a few minutes of rage to ruin your own life.  In these classes there are tricks and strategies you will learn that can help you.   If you didn't learn coping mechanisms as a child it's never too late.
3307,Stripes_2009,"I took one of these classes, first thing they teach you is your are not a robot ( i hope) and that you don't have switches or triggers, you either let them effect you or you don't.  I have a temper to end all tempers can relate to most of everything being said here, but the first step you can take as a person, is should I let this effect me? Should I let them run my life? cuz when you give into that anger and give into that rage you let them take your life and use you.. 

Being aware of your anger is the first step, the second step is being aware of your triggers and shutting them off, third is removing anything that is toxic to you. 

I dont know you but I have faith that you will find your path and you will be whole some day soon!.

Peter Gabriel

I'm scared of swimming in the sea
Dark shapes moving under me
Every fear I swallow makes me small
Inconsequential things occur
Alarms are triggered
Memories stir
It's not the way it has to be

I'm afraid of what I do not know
I hate being undermined
I'm afraid I can be devil man
And I'm scared to be divine
Don't mess with me my fuse is short
Beneath this skin these fragments caught

When I allow it to be
There's no control over me
I have my fears
But they do not have me

Walking through the undergrowth, to the house in the woods
The deeper I go, the darker it gets
I peer through the window
Knock at the door
And the monster I was
So afraid of
Lies curled up on the floor
Is curled up on the floor just like a baby boy

I cry until I laugh

I'm afraid of being mothered
With my balls shut in the pen
I'm afraid of loving women
And I'm scared of loving men
Flashbacks coming in every night
Don't tell me everything's alright

When I allow it to be
It has no control over me
I own my fear
So it doesn't own me

Walking through the undergrowth, to the house in the woods
The deeper I go, the darker it gets
I peer through the window
Knock at the door
And the monster I was
So afraid of
Lies curled up on the floor
Is curled up on the floor just like a baby boy

I cry until I laugh

I'm not him, but I'd say identity feminists are likely part of the problem therein. Since it's all about WHO you are, which facilitates a collectivist mindset, and which then excludes men due to this collective mindset (which they will claim to care about while ignoring). You may even think you care, but you probably don't... like most people in society I think...

I don't think you're a bad person for being an identity feminist, i'm sure you're a nice person and all, I just don't think you do as much good as you think you do."
3324,seriouslees,"Third wavers are the groups who shut down talks put on by celebrated feminist doctorates when they discuss female privilege.

I've yet to *ever* hear anyone claim to be a 3rd wave feminist who is in support of equal right for all, regardless of gender.

You are a very rare occurrence, and if you truly believe the group you claim to be a part of actually supports gender equality, you have a lot of work to do to correct the awful and hateful impression the mouthpieces of your group leave."
3325,seriouslees,"Wow, nice humblebrag. ""Well, I've been fortunate enough to never run across such people!"" first off, bullshit, you certainly have, if not in real life then through countless online articles of ""feminists"" who disrupt college events or what have you. secondly, denial isn't healthy. These people exist, and they tarnish the name of people in pursuit of actual equality. Burying your head in the sand and pretending they aren't a real threat is dangerous. They need to be countered with even more vocal opposition, because ignoring them doesn't make them go away and only lets them act as the mouthpiece for the group ideology they **claim** to be a part of."
3326,AmoralNiceGuy,">Oh you're talking about the Boogeyman

I can no longer believe that anybody that is paying attention has not seen this extremist movement that developed within the feminist movement and the very real harm that they are causing to a once great movement and its public face.

That suggests to me that you are either:

1) NOT been paying attention and have insufficient information to talk on this subject

2) purposefully trying to make identification of this problem seem crazy or infantile because you are in denial that it is happening and you don't want to believe it.

3) are part of this extremist group and do not see your actions/beliefs as extreme

4) not part of the extremist group, but want them to keep doing what they are doing because it benefits you all the same

5) or are a troll

If any 5 of these are the case, your opinion should probably be ignored.

If you and the people among the feminist movement are truly egalitarian, then why not call yourself egalitarianists.  The benefits are three fold:

1) It would dis-empower the extremists in feminism as they could no longer claim they are speaking for a large swath of people

2) Gets the ball rolling on getting everyone's rights being seen as a collective issue (equality)

3) Reduces social fracturing and the chances of divide and conquer coming from above, and the more negative aspects of identity politics.

Could the egalitarian movement be corrupted in the same way? Yes, but we will cross that bridge when we come to it, and if we learn from the lessons of feminism and its extremists... maybe we could head of the same problem in the future.

.... or we could stick our heads in the sand and say feminism is still a untarnished force for social good.

This particular one isn't setting a double standard at all. She's just making a joke, she never implied that the same can't be true for women. There's nothing sexist about what she said, though I guess it's a little shallow, but it wasn't meant to be taken too seriously either "
3428,Duralon,"I feel that there can be a value in tidbits like this. The MHRM isn't just about fighting, legally, for the legal parity for men compared to women, it's also about exposing the hypocrisy in the cultures in which we live. 

If we fix the laws so that a woman must have a valid, clear reason in which she divorces her husband, that doesn't mean that a particularly hypergamous woman won't still see men as walking ATMs. If we change the laws to make it so that the Draft is abolished, it still won't change the fact that men are seen as disposable, physically, mentally, and socially.

This isn't just about a legal war - it's a social war. Men are fighting to be seen as human beings. Part of that process is taking a spotlight to all of the ways that men are seen as tools and utilities, rather than as human beings. The idea is to expose the culture that denigrates us, and bring it into the spotlight where everyone with potential compassion for the rights and humanity of men and boys (ideally, people who are related to men and boys, but that isn't always the case...) can see and recognize that there is, in fact, a social bias against men that is deeply, culturally seeded. 

Legal equality is only one goal of the MHRM. We're also striving for - justly - social equality, as well."

3436,Duralon,"> Genuinely curious, why do you guys lend so much credence to what people say on Facebook?

Let's put it in this example; If you saw a post such as this, and it's not been disagreed with, or, in fact, it's been liked and commended overwhelmingly, you can get the sense that the content of the post is socially acceptable.

For many people, the original post is completely innocuous and harmless. The post below that, however, is likely to be seen as hateful and bigoted, due to how our society thinks of male sexuality. (For clarification, society tends to believe that female sexuality is a gift that should be cherished and accepted no matter the circumstance. Male sexuality, on the other hand, is seen as predatory and harmful to woman, no matter the circumstance.) 

To take an extreme example, imagine if the posts had been reversed, and the man's post was chronologically placed first. The reaction of a feminist subreddit might be anger, as well as being seen as evidence of the cultural 'oppression' of women. 

Am I saying that men are oppressed? Of course not. When a person can type something as tacky as this - something that just casually demeans an entire gender - unapologetically, it's a bit of an indication on what that person thinks of that gender, generally. Am I saying that this woman is a violent, frenzied, man-hating bitch? Again, of course not. But the MHRM is fighting for not only the legal, but social parity between men and women (and most of us would prefer men be elevated to this position, rather than have women be brought down from theirs.) This kind of attitude, which can be seen as primarily anti-man to some (personally, I think I've devoted far too many words for far too harmless an example) is precisely what we're trying to stand against in the MHRM. Once the life of a man is legally and socially as valuable as a woman's life, then we'll be content."

Both with conflicting arguments but the same amount of annoyance to everyone in the entire community (America).

Point being. This sub is a direct effect of the feminist movement. The feminist movement is bullshit in America. Old school fems are appalled at what they are seeing from these women. Victimizing half of humanity when in reality they are only holding themselves back by placing nonexistent barriers around themselves. It's almost like a fucking disease. If those women did not directly attack men for doing not a god damn thing, this whole men's rights bullshit wouldn't be happening. Does this sub push it too far? Yeah, it does. But does everything have to be in exact accordance with the whole ""men's right"" sub to be relevant here? No, it shouldn't have to be if it is somewhat relevant or at least a little bit funny. Most of the people here are just tired of feminist women victimizing themselves for no fucking reason other than they feel entitled for something more than they already have. They have, everything a man does. Literally everything in this country if not more, that is available to men is available to women. If you are supporting feminism in other countries, that's fucking wonderful. I applaud you, you're doing exactly what should be done. If you're fighting for women's rights here, you're more than likely an entitled, self-centered, egotistical cunt who is so shoved up your own ass you think you shit doesn't stink. The others are brainwashed by this downright despicable movement going on against men who are apparently all the same.

I have no problems with women, I have problems with women who assume less of me for being born into my own gender. That's sexism and that's what this new regime of feminists are, sexists. Is this sub any better? Most of the time? Yes, it is better. There are some posts here that are eye rolling to the common man that just thinks ""why are you victimizing yourself"". Because that is what some of the posts here are, backwards new wave feminism. Don't buy into that it's okay for you to victimize yourselves, you look like a god damn little whiny bitch. Is it infuriating? Yes, it is. But bite your tongue. These new wave feminists feed off of the hatred of the point of view like vampires to blood. My advice is either, if they are easily perturbed, mess with them by playing mind games about new wave feminism or just ignore them. My advice, unless the person is really fun to enrage, just ignore them."

I mean, I thought even the most mouth frothingest ""Menemist"" would acknowledge that that's because more men are employed in industry jobs.

I'm also aware that the sort of shaming (wet geezers) doesn't really help anything when it comes to debate, but I actually didn't come here to debate I just found it on all. It's not my responsibility to educate others out of their ignorance so personally I believe it's fair to pick and chose when to do it.

Now, that isn't to say that the institution of marriage should be sacrosanct - If there is evidence of abuse in the household, or evidence of infidelity, then yes, those are perfectly good grounds for a divorce.

Even though the comparison is actually quite clear, what you bring to the table for your partner to enjoy.

In such a brazen form as ""if he shaves and looks like a nerdy fuck, dump his ass"" vs ""if she takes off her makeup and looks like an ugly man-girl, dump her ass"", its much easier to show the double standard without having to put in effort by people spinning the narrative of ""but money and sex aren't the same thing so you can't compare a guy's wallet to a woman's sex drive!"".

You know that too is also from less women CHOOSING to go into high paying STEM fields in college and instead choose lower paying careers such as child care and education. 

So if it is ok to throw around a wage gap statistic based on the jobs women CHOOSE (not about getting paid less for the same job, that is not where the statistic comes from, but they will let you believe that) Isn't it OK to also throw around a death statistic based on the jobs that men choose? 

I don't think either are really something to fight for, but the comparison is there. "
3669,NonsensicalOrange,"> Arguments like more men die in industrial accidents - that's because more men are employed in industry jobs.

Isn't the same true for any gender issue, no matter what the issue is there will be an underlying cause. There is still a gender discrepancy with men taking on riskier jobs and suffering for it, then it is argued that men are suffering from their own problems and the cause for the job differences can be blamed on gender roles. That's how the whole gender political war works, then both sides just dismiss their opponent's problem like you did.

If feminists complain about sexism because of increased rates of sexual assault, can't manists complain about increased rates of assault, murder, or suicide? If feminists look for gender discrepancies related to work (like the pay gap), why is it more unreasonable for a masculist to bring up their own gender discrepancies, either as a rebuttal or complaint, to point out that men work longer hours in fields with lower work satisfaction and experience much higher risks of death or injury?"

See, you don't have the right to feel safe because sometimes the source of that feeling of fear comes from your own bigotry and not something the other person actually did wrong.

At best, you have the right to pursue the feeling of safety. Just like the having the right to the pursuit of happiness.

And the problem with feminist advocacy in regard to these ""fears"" that people shouldn't have to fear is the deliberately lack of any attempt to test against reality. Thus the vague and highly description of the definition being way too subjective. A bigot's fear might be no less intense than somebody who has had a knife drawn on them but we need objective measures that dismiss the former and handle the latter.

Picture poster didn't do a good job of explaining that last part but, to be fair, when a huge social movement is clamoring for legally sanctioned misandry you need to shut that down before you begin tackling discrepancies in the nuances of assault."

Let's try this with context: Person says ""men this and that"". Man disagrees, says ""women this and that"". Person you are defending says, ""haha, that man, so triggered"". What?

3715,killcole,"> If feminists complain about sexism because of increased rates of sexual assault, can't manists complain about increased rates of assault, murder, or suicide?

Because in matter of sexual assault it's usually a male offender. In matters of assault and murder, it's also usually male offenders. Therefore, men are essentially their own problem and responsible for their own gender's oppression. This isn't the case with female sexual assault. 

You could blame gender roles/expectations on this male issue, but it's not a case of women oppressing men - so it isn't an issue of sexism. 

It's an issue of circumstance pertaining to gender roles.

There may be better examples out there to use. This isn't one of them"
3716,karikit,"I think it's unreasonable for men/(manists?) to bring up their own gender discrepancies as a repudiation of the woman's point.  A valid counter point to an argument should be ""your claims may not be true because of XYZ reasons"", not ""well, someone else has it bad too"".  Men's rights aren't necessarily the opposite of women's rights. It's a shame that Manists (ok, I'll embrace the term) position themselves that way.

The largest feminist organization, the National Organization for Women, alongside the League of Women Voters, lobbied against shared parenting and alimony reform just last year. The even went as far as to call father's rights groups an ""abuser's lobby."" Among the provision in the bill were a rebuttable presumption of shared custody, standardized formulas as starting points in determining support awards, and the *abolition of permanent alimony*. This obstruction to shared parenting goes back to the 1990s, which is to say they have opposed shared parenting for over two decades. This is only one of many examples of what feminist groups do in the name of ""equality."" It is not in the interest of mra's to align with feminist interests because they are counter to improving the legal rights of men.

The discussion on political inequality is not misleading. Men are the vast majority of homeless, suicides, and incarcerated. Why aren't there government offices dedicated to those issues and how they concern men? Why are there so few government services for male victims of DV even though they are near half of all victims? Furthermore, why would the UK government seek to ratify the Istanbul Convention on domestic violence, even though it ignores male victims completely and attack those who point it out (like MP Davies). It seems as though you're under the impression that men have the run of the mill in Western society, when there are many ways in which they are disadvantaged.

Furthermore, having followed the exploits of men's rights activists in the UK, it incredibly clear that there is outright antagonism toward discussing men's issues in the government. This includes MPs deriding the thought of discussing men's issues on International Men's Day, political smears on MPs who attend the International Conference on Men's Issues, and countless media attacks on the broader movement by the state-run BBC. The UK government doesn't even recognize male and female rapists under the same law, and in fact only men can be legally classified as a rapist."

How about you take YOUR cognitive* dissonance and stop spouting crap lmao. Why are you going all over /r/mensrights talking about wage gap? You're full of shit. 

Prove it - go ahead. Prove it to me. You can't and I garuntee you people here have MANY more sources and verifiable facts to show you are incorrect than you have showing you're right. 

Why do you believe in the wage gap so much? Why push that bullshit? It does nothing to help women - maybe fight for a real cause and help women being held back in other countries were TRUE oppression is happening. 

The wage gap is a myth. This is fact. I have been employed for as long as I remember and every company I've ever worked at has payed fairly to both men and women. Guess what positions pay more than in-office positions? My companies Sales positions. Guess how many women apply to be a receptionist compared to a sales person? It's astronomical the difference. 

THAT is where wage gap comes from. Because Susy here is being paid $15 an hour being a receptionist - nothing wrong with that we have men here being paid that too. 

However for every 1 Susy that is applying for a receptionist position 15 men are trying to get one of our Sales positions which can easily pay 6 figures if you're good at it and have the work ethic. 

We have had 2 successful women sales people in the history of our company. They both make bank. But for those 2, there are 45+ men in the sales department. We WANT to hire more women there. We cannot. 

Maybe women need to look at themselves and realize ""If I'm going to choose receptionist, child care, gender studies, education and those types of fields in schools over STEM fields, appliable trades, business/sales....then maybe I need to accept I'll be paid less..just like Men do when they make the same decisions!"" 

Chew on that for a bit...think about it. Because there is no evidence both anecdotal nor factual/statistical that shows Mr Receptionist gets paid $17 an hour while Mrs. Receptionist gets paid $15. Or that Mr. Doctor MD gets paid more than Mrs. 

"
3743,NonsensicalOrange,"Something doesn't need to be caused by women for men's rights to bring it up. Rape isn't considered a women's issue because men do it more often, it's a women's issue because it's believe more women are raped than men. More men suffer from assault, murder, and suicide making it a men's rights issue, it's a valid complaint for why men have difficulties. 

If you thought I was blaming women, that wasn't intended, we all know women aren't the primary perpetrators. There is still prejudice involved, targeting men is still sexism if men are the ones doing it, it's not just sexism when women are the majority of the victims. The cause is also gender related, but i would rather not get into that (speculate)."
3744,NonsensicalOrange,"> It's a shame that Manists (ok, I'll embrace the term) position themselves that way.

Feminists have this complaint. The problem is, you're doing something similar, malists said men are more likely to die working and you said dismissed the complaint as ridiculous, then you blamed meninists for not listening. The issue is far more nuanced. Masculists also say feminists do exactly the same thing, not listening and misrepresenting the issues. Menists believe feminists villify menrightists, even saying that machoists endorse rape and patriarchy.

I'm pretty sure both sides feel that way. If one side feels the need to have it worse, they aren't going to take the other side's complaints seriously because it undermines their own. If one side advocates for a gender advantage, sometimes that can put the other gender at a disadvantage. There are things they can do together, but many things things also oppose the other, therefore the animosity. "

They are fantastic human beings. Wonderful people. I cannot count the rest of these new wave feminists I've met and conversed with on all my fingers and toes. At least around 25-30. Besides those two, every single new wave feminist I have met have been dogmatic, narcissistic cunts. Now maybe I have some feigned sense of reality because of very bad circumstances but I have met two people that were not awful people out of 25-30, however, I do not agree with any new feminist ideals besides one. The vast majority of these claims these women are making are false. The numbers they are spitting out are cooked.

Look at the national census for example and you will see that the national average pay for women is lower than mens. That includes *all* working and unemployed people, not just employed. Women take maternity leave, which I agree should be paid leave at least twice in this country but is not mandatory which is sad. Women are more likely to be homemakers. Lower paying jobs, etc. All of these arguments stem from that census! If you honestly think that women actually make less than men, why wouldn't companies higher exclusively women? That argument is the biggest crock of shit in feminist history.

All I'm saying is that it is rare to find a good person in this new wave feminism. In a day and age where the taboo is no longer taboo, new wave feminism (again I'm saying NEW WAVE!) has one valid argument and that is it.

Or do you think it's women incarcerating men at a greater rate than others?

Obviously nothing is perfect but you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and you seem callous towards the inequality that exists that predominantly harms women. You complain about men can only be legally classified as a rapist, but this is a decision by a predominantly male government and you seem to have no comments on the fact that men are predominantly the perpetrators of rape crimes. 

So on one hand you have complaints regarding suicide which isn't even a gendered issue, like seriously, men do choose more ""effective"" suicide methods but suicide and mental health that drives people to that is an issue that faces both genders equally and isn't perpetrated by one over the other. But on the other hand you complain about rape and how women aren't being brought to charge on rape enough, whereas if men raped as much as women did we'd see a *massive* improvement and your focus should, if your concern is about rape victims, be on reducing this culture that allows for men to rape or sexually assault women.

Historically, even people over 18 didn't have rights until they earned them by some manner, e.g. service to the state militarily.

The problem with youth rights is that it's asking to let younger, less experienced people make decisions which might be bad for them, but the corollary is: If they never make those decisions while younger, how do they know not to do them while older?"

As to why I believe in the Wage gap so much? Well tbh, I wouldn't pinpoint a degree to which I ""believe"" it. I recognise it as a statistically verified fact. I believe in fighting for wage equality based on gender, as a CAUSE, no more than I do for wage equality based on race, or issues of police brutality due to race, underrepresentation of men in custody battles. These are all issues I think we need to solve. I'm not issue biased. I just recognise theres some shit that as a society, we need to sort out. Some are more pressing than others, usually depending on your own circumstance and what resonates with you. For me, the gender pay gap isn't exactly at the top of the list but it's on it.

> The wage gap is a myth. This is fact. I have been employed

No shade but this is exactly where you're going wrong in your view of the world. You look at your own circumstance through your own lense and don't see any problems, so you assume there is one, even though in mass surveys the problem is brought to the fore.

[Three](http://www.equalpayportal.co.uk/statistics/) - perhaps the most interesting. Touches on some of the points a lot of people who deny the pay gap choose. Like how it exists to a larger degree in skilled professions (trades like plumbing etc) BUT ALSO at similar rates for Managers, Directors and the like.

It also touches on how the gender gap has decreased over time - progress we wouldn't have had if it was up to wage gap deniers who have existed for years (fortunately most people saw through the bullshit). Touches on lowest earners having the lowest pay gap too. 

But STILL acknowledges that as the jobs become more high paying, the discrepancy continues to grow. 

[Four](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/11/gender-pay-gap-does-not-exist-between-men-and-women-doing-the-sa/) Headline aside, this article does actually acknowledge the pay gap, but says it isn't AS wide as it's made out to be in certain geographic areas, but is wide in others. Furthermore, although it downplays the pay gap in certain places, it does still cite a gap in earnings due to the glass ceiling.

3765,killcole,"No I'll actually back that. I agree. See my problem on this sub is that because so often arguments are posed as Men's rights vs. Women's rights. Either to imply one impeaches on the other, or the other is actually less important than so called SJWs imply.

I forget sometimes that there are logical people who understand the nuances of both, and are actually more in line with my thinking that both men and women have their disadvantages socially. 

To be clear though, my position is that it's still easier for men to be successful in most of the Western and Eastern world than women. "
3766,Fermit,They haven't made one argument about the pay gap. They just keep saying that it exists. Don't applaud willful ignorance and laziness.
3767,Ontoanotheraccount,What part of what I said makes you feel attacked? 
3768,LukaCola,"Seriously, feminism tries to fight against imposed injustices that predominantly negatively affect women. What do MRAs do besides fight feminists? 

It was not because women collectively decided to not do the grunt-work, they were literally barred from it, from higher education, from pursuing the arts, from pursuing so much of what men already do with no restriction because of their sex. And this has only changed in very recent years and is still overwhelmingly lopsided towards men.

I sure as hell am not lacking in representation, that's for sure, so what is it MRAs are fighting for here? Feminists I know are fighting for better representation, for equal opportunity, for proper protection and treating their issues as serious. What are the men here trying to accomplish, really? Because any issue you can point out as being harmful towards men *comes from this system of injustice that feminists are fighting*. 

It's not women who are sending men to jail at disproportionate rates, it's not women sending men to war. This shouldn't be an us vs them if people here actually cared about men's rights."

3776,LukaCola,What is new wave feminism? 
3777,contractor808,"> Well see this is what I kind of mean by self-serving, you sure have found a lot of ways to paint yourself as the victim while ignoring the benefits men have in response to this system. And it's not like this is because of feminism that these issues exist, no, it's due to systemic inequalities largely perpetrated by a patriarchical society. Or do you think it's women incarcerating men at a greater rate than others?

It's absurd to state that the damage caused by feminists explicitly lobbying against reform is not because of feminism. Or was it the patriarchy that forced the members of NOW to lobby in Florida or previously write declarations opposing shared parenting? Second, your falling into a very common trope of people who criticize men's issues. The mrm does not value victimhood in the same way other movements do. It is not a claim to power or special treatment in the way that the progressive stack ranks demographics. It's a call to action to those who value treating people equally, particularly under the law. It is the declaration that there is a problem to solve, not that other problems are lesser. And it's not a declaration that other problems don't deserve attention, as you seem to do by consistently talking about how ""women have it worse"" and I'm not paying them enough attention. I find it ironic that you talk about equality, but can't stand the thought of men being victims of discrimination.

And I don't think women are incarcerating men at greater rates, and if they were it wouldn't matter as the legislation is what leads disproportionate incarceration. For example domestic violence and child support policies primarily target men, leading to male victims and impoverished men to being incarcerated.

> Obviously nothing is perfect but you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and you seem callous towards the inequality that exists that predominantly harms women.

Not mentioning women in a discussion on the topics in this sub means I'm callous? There wasn't a reason to given the specific topics. I also didn't mention trans people, asians, or muslims. Am I callous to them as well now? And, innumerate the list of ways women are being treated unfairly. I expect a large number will be false, and/or subjective claims based on patriarchy theory.

> You complain about men can only be legally classified as a rapist, but this is a decision by a predominantly male government and you seem to have no comments on the fact that men are predominantly the perpetrators of rape crimes.

Men are only the predominant perpetrators if you go by the flawed classifications of the CDC. They classified male victims of rape only if they were penetrated. The 12-month estimates for men and women when comparing rape and ""made to penetrate"" were both over 1 million reports, with the totals only about 200k apart.

Men are the majority of suicides worldwide, with few exceptions. This includes countries with various gun control regimes, religious majorities, and cultural norms. Why do you find it inappropriate to question why this trend would persist globally? And locally, why are men more likely to commit suicide later in life, particularly after divorce? Could it be that the laws are unfair? That losing contact with one's children could make someone suicidal? Would a man who makes less that 10k a year (the majority of child support debtors) who has no way to pay his debts, find suicide an attractive alternative to a cycle of imprisonment? Suicide does affect both genders, but the paths to suicide can differ greatly. It is worth examining how these paths differ and in what ways legislation has an impact."
3778,contractor808,"Liberty is supporting an individuals choice to make decisions about their own body. Nothing is stopping an adult doing it later in life.

3780,1forthethumb,HOLY FUCK I'M NOT ALONE
3781,rileyk,Agreed. Well said.
3782,scyth3s,"> facts like the proportion of men in leading positions in companies

Again, that's not a wage gap. It's people doing different jobs. Is some of that discrimination? Probably. But the majority of it? Before you answer, consider this:

[Payscale’s report indicated that men who own small businesses earn a salary that ranges from $42,575 to $96,111. Women, on the other hand, only earn $31,380 to $71,140 every year.](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/average-income-small-business-owners-5189.)

A gender wage gap among *owners.* People who within the means of their business, set their own salary. And men take more than women.

It is *you* that has a cognitive dissonance that women are simply entitled to equal money. This data, which is available from several other sources, demonstrates a difference either in ability or priorities of women to demand better wages or seek those positions in the first place. 

That's not a wage gap. That's you having cognitive dissonance."
3783,Lywik270,Well who exactly are you actually talking to? Have you tried talking to someone who maybe has a bachelors in women's studies or public health? Because internet feminism and actual feminist policy are two very different things. It's like saying 4chan adequately represents the trump voter.
3784,maltastic,Not what you said. It's what a lot of other people have said on threads like these. 
3785,upthatknowledge,So youll just whine and bitch? 
3786,randomyaho0,CIS scum

3788,Skapes1230,Not sure if it's a coined term but that's what I call it. It's normally called contemporary feminism and many of the women who were and still are feminists/women's rights activist are constantly critiquing and shedding light on the fallacies that the contemporary (or new wave is what I call it) feminists like to constantly shove down people's throats. Christina Hoff is the prime example of one of the former feminist leaders that has kept her ideals and dismisses/disproves the contemporary views which hold no weight.
3789,LukaCola,">It is the declaration that there is a problem to solve, not that other problems are lesser. 

This isn't honest, especially coming from someone who is willingly and deliberately downplaying issues the other sex faces. You dismissed many of them as false ""and/or subjective (whatever that means) claims based on patriarchy theory.""

You've dismissed things before even hearing them.

You dismiss findings you don't agree with.

And you overstate issues that serve yourself.

This is purely self-serving and absolutely seeks to downplay and make it an us vs them situation. This is the hypocrisy of the MRM, and precisely why many people don't want to associate with them. "

3793,PostNuclearTaco,Lots of people who I am friends with from college. And it doesn't matter if the people with bachelors in women's studies have feminism right when 99% of the people involved in the movement drown them out with inaccurate bullshit. A few people with bachelors degrees don't make a difference when most self-proclaimed feminists don't share their views.
3794,upthatknowledge,Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
3795,LukaCola,"But what *is* it? Like, I could define the different ideals that define third wave feminism for instance, mostly revolving around including ethnic minorities into feminism. But I don't know what you're describing with contemporary or new wave feminism.

Define it for me. What is the argument you are making a stance against? Or one of them, for instance, and who or what groups in the feminist community would you say represent these views? "
3796,contractor808,"I dismiss them because I've heard them all. If you'd like to provide counter examples then I'd like to see them. 90% of the time people cite cultural factors that can't be proven/disproven or the fictional wage gap. Rarely people discuss abortion rights or rape kit backlogs, the latter of which is due in part to defendants confirming sex occurred or dropped cases.

So please do continue to ignore the rest of my statements if that means you're focusing your attention on writing a list of ways women are legally disadvantaged or provable ways in which women are socially disadvantaged. You'll get bonus points if you can do so without mentioning ""toxic masculinity"" or the nonexistent patriarchy ""backfiring"" on men.

Lastly there's only an us vs them situation because the ""them"" stand in opposition to men's issues getting attention. I just explained how NOW opposes shared parenting. If feminism were for equality then the men's issues movement wouldn't exist in the first place out of necessity. This has been the situation since at least the 1800s when the Tender Years Doctrine of default maternal custody was enacted by the feminist Caroline Norton in the Custody of Children Act. The ""tender years"" were eventually amended up to *age 16.*"
3797,contractor808,"I didn't ask if they have equal weight. I asked if they both have to register. And they both do not, [only men.](https://www.sss.gov/Registration/Women-And-Draft) The Selective Service is unequal discrimination in employment, financial aid, and serves as a registry for the draft. Young men died in Vietnam who registered and nothing was done to fix this problem.

The [full list](https://www.sss.gov/Registration/Why-Register/Benefits-and-Penalties) of benefits and penalties regarding Selective Service can be found on the SSS website. The list is summarized:

> A young man who fails to register with Selective Service may be ineligible for opportunities that may be important to his future. He must register to be eligible for federal student financial aid, state-funded student financial aid in many states, most federal employment, some state employment, security clearance for contractors, job training under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (formerly known as the Workforce Investment Act), and U.S. citizenship for immigrant men."

all that said, discussing the human form by ranking men by their bulges is still sexist and stupid. But that's just shitty use of words from a pretty shit news source. Seeing olympians get some attention for the care and hard work they put into their physique would be cool is more what im saying.

3989,DarthCerebroX,"> We aren’t becoming more repressed sexually as a society 


Idk about that..

https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/11/01/sexual-harassment-how-genders-and-generations-see-/

- 30% of women aged 18-25 believe winking at a woman is ‘usually or always’ sexual harassment
- 30% of women aged 18-25 believe complimenting a woman on her attractiveness is usually or always sexual harassment
- A third of all people aged 18-25 believe asking a woman to grab a drink is usually or always sexual harassment

You can click the link to the full study from that article... it’s pretty enlightening seeing the difference in college aged people’s opinions compared to people 45+.... The younger people are the more prudish or regressive they seem to be. They are far more willing to classify something (even innocent things like giving a woman a compliment or asking her out) as sexual harassment.

If you ask me, all this feminist SJW bullshit has had a bigger impact on society than people want to admit. 

If we’re at the point now where a third of college aged people believe asking a woman on a date or to grab a drink is a form of harassment... then it makes the dating scene quite a scary prospect. Why would young men risk asking a woman out if a third of them will accuse you of sexually harassing them? 

At this rate, I predict more and more men will just say “fuck it” and walk away from romantic relationships with women. There’s far too many risks and minefields you have to navigate in the modern dating scene. 

As far as myself, ... it reaffirms my decision to go MGTOW and live for myself instead. "

It’s a tiny percentage of people who give any group a bad name, who spew hate instead of looking to take steps for equality, for a better world. They’re loud, is all, and the internet only amplifies that sort of bullshit. 

I know that’s not helpful in actually addressing those small groups of people who *do* act reprehensibly. In regards to misandrists, I just call them out on their behaviour and hope they can see the double standard inherent in their point of view. It doesn’t always work, but like with anything worth doing, that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t keep trying. 

I can understand anger, and even fear when it comes to men. But the majority of women I know personally that have good reason to hate men, *don’t* - they hate the one that raped them, or beat them, or emotionally abused them. They hate the ones that used their positions of power to blackmail them, they hate the ones that make women’s lives worse - which, very obviously, does not apply to every man. You can’t judge the actions of any group by the worst - just in how the rest of that group responds to that worst example of them. 

And at the moment, with all the shit happening in Hollywood and women being listened to in that industry for what seems like the first time regarding the sheer amount of abuse within that system - we can see that the vast majority of men are just as disgusted by those few as women are. Now all we can hope for is that the men who are in those positions, who have been pressured and assaulted and raped are listened to as well - Terry Crews, Anthony Rapp, etc.

Makes me wonder if the writer has actually ever talked to a man.

They go on and on about how cool it is she'll play video games with him, and surprises him with his favorite food. And *then* go, oh yea and she's smokin'.

It's the same at work. We all work in sales; the dudes are all chill and get along with everyone, but the women are constantly talking shit about each other behind their backs to us, and constantly causing drama over petty shit while trying to get people on ""their side.""

4105,MasterofThinking,Maybe they can't openly support men because if they do it gets in the way of someone else's narrative pushing? 
4106,JestyerAverageJoe,"> I know it may not seem it, but generally speaking the vast majority of any group - be it feminists, men’s rights activists, Muslims, Christians, gay people, Black Lives Matter, whatever - are actually moderates. They’re just trying to make their world better, and most let common sense temper the desire to be angry, or to be a victim (even in situations where they are actually justified in being angry, or actually are victims). It’s a tiny percentage of people who give any group a bad name, who spew hate instead of looking to take steps for equality, for a better world. They’re loud, is all, and the internet only amplifies that sort of bullshit.

I completely understand and fully agree, believe it or not. :-) Here within the MRM, you will find men who go too far and are simply misogynistic -- and even if it's true, I won't excuse it away and say ""I understand it because they're angry;"" be that as it may, it's unacceptable, and if you look, you'll see those comments and posts tend to be downvoted pretty rapidly and ignored.

> I know that’s not helpful in actually addressing those small groups of people who do act reprehensibly. In regards to misandrists, I just call them out on their behaviour and hope they can see the double standard inherent in their point of view. It doesn’t always work, but like with anything worth doing, that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t keep trying. 

This is the crux of my point. I really (genuinely) appreciate that you call out misandry when you see it. But to your point above -- when the majority of feminists, say, are moderate and genuinely have a positive interest in improving the world, and do not hate men, why are so few of these moderates speaking out against the vitriolic, hate-filled, misandrist feminists who dominate the narrative? It is a false equivocation to say that because all groups have bad apples, all groups deal with their bad apples similarly. I wish I had $1 for every reasonable feminist with whom I've spoken, who privately agreed with my criticisms at least to a degree, but who refused to speak out against the ""sisterhood"" broadly.

It is this failure to accept criticism that has caused feminism to fail and become what it is. Regardless of the moderates, on the face of it: Privileged, entitled, wealthy white women whining about minor inconveniences like ""manspreading"" or air conditioning levels, while openly celebrating their hatred of men and calling for their extinction.

You do know that ""the future is female"" derives from a text calling for global gendercide of the male population, I hope.

So where is the outrage from all of these supposedly moderate feminists, that their movement overtly hates men? Where is the female outrage at how their brothers, fathers, sons, husbands, and friends are being treated?

> I can understand anger, and even fear when it comes to men. But the majority of women I know personally that have good reason to hate men, don’t - they hate the one that raped them, or beat them, or emotionally abused them. They hate the ones that used their positions of power to blackmail them, they hate the ones that make women’s lives worse - which, very obviously, does not apply to every man. You can’t judge the actions of any group by the worst - just in how the rest of that group responds to that worst example of them. 

I understand and largely agree. I assume that you would feel similar sympathy for a man who has come to hate his ex wife who, say, lied in court to obtain full custody, or demands an egregious alimony after a divorce, or accuses him falsely of rape?

I assume you would further agree that the moment at which one of these people begins speaking about the behaviors or actions of ""men"" or ""women,"" it becomes problematic, correct? There is a difference between ""the man who raped me"" and ""men, who rape.""

> And at the moment, with all the shit happening in Hollywood and women being listened to in that industry for what seems like the first time regarding the sheer amount of abuse within that system - we can see that the vast majority of men are just as disgusted by those few as women are. Now all we can hope for is that the men who are in those positions, who have been pressured and assaulted and raped are listened to as well - Terry Crews, Anthony Rapp, etc.

Are you really surprised that the vast majority of men are also decent people who don't want women or men to be hurt?

What do you make of the relative silence regarding male victims as you outlined, as well as total silence regarding women who have been similarly accused? Given these discrepancies, can you see how this movement appears less than honest in terms of ending sexual violence rather than pursuing a specific narrative about certain types of people? Bluntly: A witchhunt to hold ""men"" broadly responsible for the reprehensible behaviors of a few individual men, and apparently, to recast virtually all heterosexual courtship rituals as sexual assault."

The small minority feminists are the only feminists, or the only ones for who it is useful to call feminists. 

If the “silent majority” is every woman who believes in women’s rights, then we can stop calling them feminists, since they’re just normal women. 

Then we can use “feminist” to refer exclusively to those “toxic minority”. Everyone who isn’t toxic minority is just a normal guy/gal. 

The reason I’m arguing this is because the “small minority” are a small group, yes, but their size is irrelevant. They are the ones who are actually changing things, and the “silent majority” are bystanders to their changes. So there’s no need to constantly say “oh it’s just a small bunch of bad ones”. "

I agree with you. I do however want to nitpick your statement. 
What about the person who would be overjoyed to have people oogling them with sexual connotations? In the view of ""If I were one of those athlete's"" then that person would be ok to post creepy comments? I mean, if it were them, they might find it flattering, so maybe they think they are doing something positive? "
4168,,">  self control, purity of mind, and sexual morality

Implying you can't have these when you sexualize another person? I disagree with the notion. I've been in a monogamous relationship for 10 years, and have no issue with self control, purity of mind or sexual morality. But that's not going to stop me from seeing a hot guy and going ""wow, he''s fucking hot"". 

That doesn't stop him from being a person. I don't have a neurological disorder. I know it's a person, that's why I'm attracted to him in the first place. I'm not attracted to a chair or toaster. I'm attracted to a human being. 

If people want to publish creepy articles, who cares? I wouldn't do it myself, but other people are going to do so regardless. If not articles, they will talk about it elsewhere. Some people simply like to do so. Just because it does not fit your moral code doesn't mean it's something that needs to stop or is actually harmful. 

>  I definitely believe in universal, non-relative moral principles. Lol. I think it's right to teach people that publishing creepy articles about people engaging in completely non-sexual activities is wrong.

4195,cloverboy77,"It's because the tolerant minority will adjust their life to fit the intolerant minority because to them it's a superficial, cosmetic change whereas it's life or death for the tiny intolerant minority. 

Here's an example. Snapple (and many other food and drink) is made kosher because people who don't follow kosher dietary rules don't care!! It's superficial to them so kosher or not kosher it's functionally equivalent. It's the same thing for all intents and purposes whereas for people who believe following kosher dietary laws is NOT a triviality but is a moral absolute it's not equivalent at all. Ergo everyone will buy the kosher food and drink but only non jews/Muslims will buy the non kosher/non halal food so eventually we'll end up with all food and drink being kosher and halal.

Same thing with this progressive/feminist nonsense *until* it's stops being a triviality for people and becomes a real nuisance and inconvenience and an actual threat to their autonomy and ability to be self determining (freedom of speech, association, restricting of opportunities and choice, etc). I think what is currently happening is we are experiencing a paradigm shift where  radical Marxist authoritarianism and radical feminism is moving out of the strictly theoretical realm of academia and starting to interfere in the real lives of real people and now, predictably, we are seeing people push back, hard. I wonder why??

It's not as if we are witnessing it's legions of fanatical ideological zealots trying to forcefully destroy and replace every single one of the corporeal manifestations of truth and reality in the existential framework in which we actually live our lives (aka ""society""). These edifices are truth and reality  physically manifested. Our most fundamental beliefs and values are *reflected* in the *reality* of how our society is constructed. Our institutions, norms, customs, rituals, etc all have been formed *around* what we already know to be true! Culture and society is *necessarily* downstream of nature and biological reality. It can't be any other way.

So our society represents the truth of lived experience by humankind over  millenia upon millenia and now we live in a time where we are expected to believe humans had it completely 100% wrong and we should destroy it all and rebuild it based on theoretical feminist/marxist bullshit (aka propoganda). Sounds reasonable. They couldn't possibly have ulterior motives for wanting this outcome other than the noble pursuit of truth and seeing that truth reflected in a new better perfect society for all do they??? Surely they couldn't possibly be motivated by the same quotidian self serving reasons rooted in our human nature we have seen reappear time and time and time again throughout all of human history??  Nah...*airy hand wave*

They defo aren't being disingenuous when they insist we must obliterate our legal institutons and rebuild them  to reflect this new, better model of what reality is and how it works. Or when they insist we have to obliterate and rebuild our academic institutionsto reflect this new and better explanation of reality. Or when they insist we have to obliterate and rebuild every model of interpersonal relationships humanity has been using since the dawn of time and replace them with their inversion so as to better reflect this new understanding of truth and reality. What could go wrong if we redefine man/woman, marriage, ideas about family, how it should be structured, etc, etc??

Sure lets replace it all with an utterly upsidedown and wholly fictitious explanatory model which only exists as a mental construct inside the damaged brains of a tiny number of antisocial rejects who invented it solely as a mechanism to rationalize and obfuscate their purely self serving actions and disingenuous motivations. What could go wrong!!!
Western Civilization, Scmilization!! Pashah! What has it ever done for humanity?? Let's try gender fluidity, human fungibility,  polyamory, mass consumptiom of hardcore pornography, nihilism, antinatalism, replacing kids with dogs, replacin christianity with wicca and horoscopes, and try cultural and moral relativism on for size and see what the fucking outcome is!!

But ""feminists"" as a team, which I like to think include all men and women who believe in social, financial, and political equality, are not standing up as one unit saying ""YES! We support showing off male athletes in this way, but not female athletes!"" 

This was not a photo on the cover of ""All Feminists Monthly"". This was a shitty article from Buzzfeed. They don't speak for feminists. 

"
4199,cosmotheassman,"I think the answer to this should be obvious. The reason why feminists would get upset if ESPN or NBC published an /r/Ohlympics style list of hot female athletes is because women have historically faced discrimination and have been oversexualized. That should be obvious to anyone who has any cultural awareness or understanding of what pop-culture and, well, life was like during the 20th and early 21st century. For decades, if not centuries, the most important quality for a woman was her looks, and nothing else mattered to the same extent. Barring the rare exceptions, the only way for a woman to be respected or successful was because of her looks. Men, on the other hand, didn't have to be attractive. They could be smart, or strong, or funny, and they would be accepted and championed for their best qualities. Women didn't have that until very recently, in fact I'd argue that our culture is just barely starting to get out of that framework, and that women face more pressure to keep up their looks then men do. So if a major media outlet were to sexualize the female athletes, people would be upset because they would see it a regression back to the days where the most important thing for a woman is her looks, and it would undermine the constant struggle to push back against those dated value systems. The reason why it's ""ok"" for a man to be sexualized like this is because men never had that cultural obligation to be beautiful. A the end of the day, the men who didn't make that list are still going to be respected for their accomplishments. Does that make sense? 

Now if people here are really upset about sexualizing athletes, then they should be just as pissed off about the existence of /r/Ohlympics, Maxim magazine, and things like The Body Issue. But to me when I see this stuff, I think its just annoying nitpicking at women/feminism and a lame attempt to portray men as victims in a situation where they aren't, which is why I can never get on board with this sub.

4265,SkeptiCynical,"My best friend in college (a female) had 2 kids (a girl and a boy) with her ex husband.  Her ex was a nasty, spineless douchebag but his mother was even worse.  She would take it upon herself to drop by ""to see the grandkids"" at 10 or 11pm - well after they had gone to sleep.  Then she'd report everything back to her son - whether she had company, if there was an extra car in the driveway, if she had a glass of wine at dinner.

As much of a cheating, unlikable asshole as he was, he didn't want his ex wife to have friends at her house and his mother shared his disdain.  His mother called Child Protective Services with an anonymous tip that the boy (aged 5) was inappropriately touching the girl (aged 3) in the bathtub.

When CPS gets involved, you are guilty until proven innocent, especially with sexually based accusations.  Two CPS agents and two police officers descend on the house.  You don't have a choice but to let them in - if you don't, you are taken into custody pending an investigation and the children are handed to the state in the interim.  The children were separated from the adults and each other, then interviewed in separate rooms.  After an admittedly short investigation with no wrongdoing found, **the 5 year old boy had a sealed record of sexual predation on a minor for 2 years **.

This was a 28 year old mother of 2 beautiful kids living in a nice house in a lily-white community - so it's not as if this was happening in a crime-ridden ghetto.  Any mechanism for reporting crime anonymously is easily abused for revenge or spite."

I feel like evidence outside of testimony should be a minimum for all cases. And yes. That means that you're going to struggle to convict someone five, ten, twenty years in the future. But at the same time, is it worse to let the guilty walk free or force the innocent to serve time for crimes they have never committed?

Testimony is not evidence. Testimony puts evidence into a context. Testimony should serve as the method through which alternate viewpoints suggest how the parts of the story that the evidence reveals are fitted together. 

This said  don't know what percentage of cases are decided by testimony alone however. Maybe there an inordinate amount of cases where there is nothing but hearsay to support a conviction. But then that in itself would suggest a problem. 

 And the current UK government said that they left innocents alone too long already. So I'm pretty sure they're going to go the other way. "

Well, after two months of writings from that company to please pay the couch (which my father always threw away without me or my mother knowing) a debt collector got involved and wanted to take away my belongings as payment. He wanted to take away the fucking plastic toys of a ~5 year old. Plus it'd be on my record (a lovely thing called ""Schufa"") if my mother didn't tell him to fuck off cause I'm 5. 

Well, what follows is at least a little bit pleasant, cause he went to my father and absolutely raped him how he could do that to his son(me). I never heard anything of it again and afaik it isn't listed anywhere, since the company where we bought that couch also got sucked in by another company. "

The law normally takes a dimmer view of those who conspire, hence the tough max penalties back when the law was made.  That prosecution cannot commence under this section without the approval of the Attorney General and an arrest cannot be made without a warrant hints to me that the Queensland Police have other, fresher powers to use in cases of false allegation/statement. I googled and couldn't find a reference to a recent charge or conviction for this offence. Could be wrong and someone might be tossed into a Qld Court dock tomorrow on a charge of s131!    In NSW the max penalty for what this women did is 7 years and I think we might find it is something similar up your way.

Even with murder where an exonerated (due to person bsng alive) accused is socially unoersecuted, a difference exists that in concocting a crime intended for persecution, someone framing for murder is intentionaly burdening the legal system.

At least real murderers usually try to cover it up and hide the body, to have it written off as runaway or something. Or confess to it and minimize bereaucratic strain.

Framers are trying to get someone jailed which aside from trial also burdens society with the expense of supporting the convict. Real murderers don't necessarily do that, so they should be punished less."

Now that newspapers are reporting in this it will disincentivize actuK victims from using the service.

Edit: to reinforce admittedly anecdotal evidence, mental illness is a commonly used tactic in court by lawyers for both men and women to evade lengthy prison sentences. I think it used to be called an ""insanity plea"" but it is completely and inarguably something done by both genders, sometimes illegitimately."

4615,Funcuz,"That's true but while a woman can claim pretty much any mental illness (including ones she makes up on the spot) and have people believe her a man can do the same and expect very little in the way of people taking the claim credibly. He pretty much has to have half his brain in a jar with him when he shows up to court.

I can't remember how many times I've read about a woman claiming she was depressed and have it pretty much get her out of jail. Nevertheless, I wouldn't use mental illness as a chance to avoid prison. It's still basically prison and typically inmates in mental hospitals spend longer in them than they would had they simply gone to prison. Of course, it's a much softer kind of prison so there's that."

If we look at the worst crime though, murder, faking your death to pin a murder on someone (I remember some movie with that plot) is usually worse if the deception is uncovered (not always, for some reason alleged sex crimes sometimes get longer sentences than real assaults) I posit that false rape accusations are potentially worse because of their effects even when a not guilty results.

If a murder victim turns up alive then the accused murderer has an untarnished reputation. But if a rape accusation results in a not guilty or even if it gets retracted before charges are pressed, it still results in mass societal prejudice and persecution against the accused. ""where there's smoke there's fire"" is an axiom I have heard from several women in my life and it terrifies me. Beyond lacking presumption if innocence they ignore even the possibility.

Double Jeopardy is one with that plot that I really enjoyed.

I agree completely.  In fact in terms of how the perpetrator is viewed, I'd even go so far as to suggest that in a lot of ways rapists are viewed even less favorably than murders.  With murder, there's certain circumstances in which people will, to a degree, excuse it. It's like they can see where if it were them in the situation they can't really be sure they wouldn't have done the same thing.  But with rape, the immediate reaction is ""wow that person is just an irredeemable monster."" "

if you really feel this is true, then a 16 year old in florida fucking a 18 or 40 year old there would be taken advantage of, and a victim, and the law punishes.

However, in Nevada, that same 16 year old would not be a victim and the law would not punish.

You can't have it both ways. When the laws differ by state, there is a human rights violation occurring. Either 16 year olds are getting ""willing but taken advantage of"" legally, or people fucking 16 year olds in florida are being unjustly persecuted and harmed for fucking 16 year olds.

If the law is making a statement irrespective of actual harm, it is a law based on social values that harms individuals, not a law based on discovery of harm. "
4664,,16 with 18 year old is rape. Retarded. There should be room in the law for the jury to decide if the minor was taken advantage of and to what extent instead of a law that has little wiggle room.

4666,wzil,"Legally speaking, minors (under the age of consent) can consent, but even with consent it is still a crime.

Forcing a minor to have sex against their will = rape of a child

Having sex with a minor who consents = statutory rape

Also, note that a minor can consent with someone who is close enough in age, indicating that consent is possible.

If police get a tip about a crime, they need to investigate further. An anonymous tip is not grounds for arresting someone. 
Also, I think that when the media reports on rapes or pedophilia before the accused is charged with a crime, and the accused goes free, the media should be forced to pay for any lost wages because businesses didn't want to be associated with someone that the general public thinks is a rapist or pedophile, and this goes on indefinitely. Also, if the accused is found not guilty, the person accusing him of rape or child rape should go to prison for just as long as he would have had he been convicted. 
This is the whole reason swatting is so prevalent, because you can anonymously call in a bomb threat or a hostage situation. 

If you want to report a bomb threat you need to give your full name and address, otherwise you can't be prosecuted and fined for being a lying cunt.

Keep the investigation private, so that nobody in the public sphere knows it's underway, and the issue is resolved. There's a reason we have slander and libel laws, they ruin lives. There's no reason not to hold investigators to the same standard and assure all innocent parties not have their reputations tarnished until proven guilty in a court of law. Even people who've actually been arrested shouldn't have the charges published until proven guilty either. There's no benefit to the public to know the charges until they've been proven true. It's enough that the arrests are public so the government can't ""disappear"" people. Trials can even remain public, so long as there's non-disclosure agreement style gag orders in place until guilt is proven. Again, there's no benefit to the public at large to known charges that are unproven. All it allows is punishment in the court of public opinion.

4717,mwobuddy,"R&J laws often simply downplay the criminal offense from felony to misdemeanor, and still require registry as sex offender. If you think it protects them, then tell that to all the 14-18 year old males on the sex offender registry, all 100,000 of them.

""Chances are"" doesn't mean shit. either it is or isn't.

If you live in nevada your whole life, then move to florida, suddenly the legal sex you were having with someone 16 becomes 'rape'.

The entire exercise is in pointing to the fallacy of age of consent law, and the basic human rights violations they are, if they arbitrarily destroy one person while letting another person go free in the same country, just because of where you happen to be in that country. You're bringing up irrelevant red herrings.

https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/when-a-sex-offender-isnt/?_r=0

you better watch your male children, because sex offending is about control and destruction of males almost unilaterally. It was designed that way from the start of the raising of age of consent in the 1850-1920 period, and it was invoked by Purity Movement Feminism, the largest, cohesive branch to get things done, with a religious bent to them. Males of all ages, even 'underage' themselves have been punished for sex with/as teens since this went into effect that long ago, and it continues today.

And you know what? If it does harm teens to have sex, if it is so harmful to their fragile little minds, yes, teens themselves should suffer the sex offender registry just like an adult. After all, they've irreparably damaged someone. I know, you'll probably trot out the tired rhetoric of ""when its adult and teen, then its abusive and damaging, but not teen on teen because its natural"" fallacy. Bullshit. Teens have the potential abuse each other just as easily as adults, in fact I'd argue moreso because being closely grouped as peers puts more pressure to perform acts to get the validation from the biggest group that matters. In fact, by age of consent law, abuse is considered matter of fact. R&J exceptions usually only downgrade the offense level for teens, not get them off the hook completely, and if sex harms teens, (read the book Harmful to Minors), then it should be that even the underage teens get on the sex offender list.

You keep using mystical arguments that have no solid foundation, and move the goalposts during argumentation about whether or not sex with teens and adults is abusive vs teens and teens not being abusive, but you'll cycle back to ""they just dont know any better"", or vague claims of ""sexual power imbalance"" that causes harm in the end. The arguments your kind use are circular.

And if you think age of consent isn't anti-male, then you better read this link and think again.

A boy who has sex with a girl under 16 is breaking the law. Even if she agrees.

If she is 13-15, the boy could go to prison for two years.

If she is under 13 he could be sentenced to life imprisonment.

IF SHE IS UNDER, not HE.

And finally, we go to the prospect that age of consent laws are violations oh human rights based on the grounds that people age differently. if people age differently, then it is quite unfair and arbitrary to punish someone who is delayed in development as an equal. And yet only EXTREME delays that are based on IQ or mental disability, rather than brain maturity delays, would be accounted for.

So there you have it, all the strings, all the information you need to know. AoC is designed for anti-male purposes, it even punishes underage males, it is based on ideologies that conflict with even themselves and the known science of the different aging coefficients of humans in general.

As far as power goes, nearly all power is a form of belief and worship. Hitler could never have done what he done without power, and what was his power? Did he launch the ships alone? Did he drop the bombs alone? It took a massive number of people to do it, to believe in his power.

Suppose you have an adult that feels powerless, they're not going to have much ""power"" in that relationship with a minor, legal or not. Because power is based on belief and the struggle for that belief to be spread to the other person in the relationship.

In fact, someone in a relationship with a minor should actually feel quite powerless, because they're a desirable and much more spontaneous individual, leading to the possibility of losing them as a mate/lover/relationship, whatever you want to call it. Power also plays itself out when one person is more attractive. If both individuals know that they're valued for their looks, then the one ho knows they're more attractive has more power, however, as I've stated, this power is belief based even so, and must be shared, like an infection with the other party.

"
4718,CurtisAxelmania,">Most likely this individual is in a position of power over that minor like a teacher

I doubt there is any evidence to support this assumption.

>Or, they're an adult and this person is a minor.

You already established that by stating the ages of the parties.

>adults always have the power in a relationship with a minor

That simply is not true. Being an adult gives no privilege in respect to minors except the right to vote, which is a power imbalance applied very indirectly.

Certain adults in positions of authority such as parents, teachers, police, doctors, social workers, employers, do hold power over minors, but those are privileges not inherent to adults.

People with more skills or intelligence hold power over those.who lack them but adulthood is no guarantee of those traits, nor do we ban 28 year old PhDs from banging 28 year old high school dropouts."
4719,,I mean there should be more than that. Also not all states have Romeo and Juliet laws. 
4720,,"Not true. A 16 year old should be able to consent to another person near that person's age. That would be hard to figure out otherwise, in court for example if a 16 year old has sex with a 16 year old and they are both not allowed to consent, then who gets charged? Do they both get charged?"
4721,Kayakingtheredriver,"Not how it works. The way our laws and Constitution are set up, if you release the information you have to release it where everyone can get the information. Your family, the media, the retired lawyer down the street has to be able to get that information through public record to be able to protect you from being disappeared. If it's private like you suggest, that's what allows the government tyranny to make you disappear. What there needs to be, is a similar agreement amongst the media not to report on people accused. Just like they don't report on the victims. But the idea that the government be the gatekeeper on who gets information is exactly how government tyranny takes root"
4722,itsthewedding,I mean I agree someone's life can be destroyed over an accusation just that you are relying on the police being 100% reputable all the time which doesn't always occur. The reason the information is released to the media is so they can hold everyone else accountable. It is also how we find out about people who are in prison indefinitely just because they never had a court appearance and were just forgotten. It is more on  the media to hopefully one day realize that accusations can be made with no proof or legitimacy. Kinda like how bad the Duke Lacrosse team situation blew out of proportion.

4726,LandMineHare,"That depends on a number of circumstances, but usually it is out of the victim's hands unless they refuse to come forward/testify."
4727,apathetic_lemur,"I have no clue. I like the idea of a percentage of income so fines, etc sting a little more equally but it doesn't take much effort to find problems with this (hiding assets for the wealthy, a percentage of income is zero for poor/jobless)"
4728,eadala,"Would you like me to assume that? Because it seems to be a pretty strongly-worded stance, hyperbole or not. Even if it is, I included an edit long before your reply that begins:

>to reinforce admittedly anecdotal evidence, mental illness is a *commonly* used tactic.

Ergo if whether he was using hyperbole or being completely serious, I covered both the easy anecdotal rebuttal and the general counter. I thought I worded things pretty clearly, but I'll be more careful in the future.
"
4729,CurtisAxelmania,"Kinda funny you are looking at power in respect to attractiveness and not the glaring fact that a minor can leverage revealing their relationship to coerce the adult into pretty much anything. Even without a minor actively doing that, a pressure exists for an adult to cave to a minor's whims because society advertises the victim complex and the slightest dissatisfaction could lead to exposure of the affair.

It is similar to how children rely on parents and would not want to risk displeasing a family member in fear of losing familial support. Parents never volunteer resources that exist to help children being abused by parents. Even those who do not abuse will not give that access because they want the sword of Damocles to hover.

An adult raped by a minor, for example, would not report it for fear of being seen as the aggressor. Especially if it happened after mutually consented-to relations. The rare instance you see this happen is when it is a woman with a gang of boys because she holds confidence of playing the ""gangraped"" card."
4730,CurtisAxelmania,"Yes they should both be charged, for their own protection, since they are both in danger from the sex."
4731,CurtisAxelmania,"We should legally mandate that if press report one they must report th other or face criminal penalties.
